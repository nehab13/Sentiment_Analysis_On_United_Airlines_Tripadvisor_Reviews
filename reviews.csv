review Today,10,Time change a day before!,We are scheduled to fly out tomorrow morning and literally received an email last night saying that our return flight time was changed to a very inconvenient time. Not even close to the original time that we selected!!! Tried calling but said I'd have to pay over $500 to get it changed to a different time (literally an hour difference). I'm beyond upset and just can not wrap my head around this! I'm going crazy and now super stressed. Thanks United....
review Yesterday,10,STAY OUT OF POLITICS,Perhaps fly a different that doesn’t politicize their views. Plenty of other airlines to choose from. Suggest they run their airline not their views.
review Yesterday,10,I think I’m getting scammed,I fly about 5 times a year and United and the sister company Copa are the only ones giving me problems. I booker this flight months ago and now that it’s getting closer my flight is getting changed on the daily to the point that I will need to cancel and pay way more. The same thing happened in December with Copa and i waited three months to get my 3k back. At least i got it. And Copa was a major headache to deal with. Hours and hours on the phone with them. Never again United or copa. I’ll pay more if needed
review Yesterday,10,Fascist Airways,Screamed at and threatened to be put on a no fly list for supporting the President of the United States of America.  Shameless anti Americans.
review Yesterday,10,You Get a NEW Beginning After COVID..WHY Choose UNITED,"I booked my ticket over 4 months ago (when people were still not even flying as heavy as today). I was running a convention for 10 days and with out any notice or correspondence, United changed my direct flight (mid afternoon) to a indirect flight. I paid for direct, I missed my last event from the convention.  Now that many people are getting back to flying, maybe time to look for a new loyalty program with a new airline...we have a new beginning!"
review Yesterday,30,No COVID precautions,"The flight was overbooked and overly crowded as a result. It felt like the cabin crew staff was not enough to handle the flight. May other passengers were violating COVID norms, for example, not wearing a mask properly and the cabin crew seemed too busy to handle that. Other than that, the flight was well on time, the food was average and the cabin staff was attentive to most needs."
Apr 4,10,Absolute terrible customer service,After having both legs of her flight change without notification United Airlines chose to do nothing for us complimentary. I ask the manager Eric at the counter if I was no value to them and that I should just shut up and get on the plane eric's response was that is exactly what you should do.
Apr 4,10,Horrendous,"Went from a 4 hour layover in San Francisco to a 6 hour, then a cross-country flight to Newark then a 1.5 hour layover before leaving for Cleveland. Never notified me of change in itinerary. 8 hour trip to Cleveland to 20 hours.  No excuse for this fiasco. Never again on United.  Horrendous customer service. Miss Continental Airlines and their customer service"
Apr 3,20,Downhill since COVID,"I've flown united once before internationally to Zurich from Washington and it was a pleasant experience. I have since signed up for their credit card and I booked 2 trips with them for this summer.    Trip 1: Baltimore to Knoxville  I was notified earlier this month that there was a reduction in service for the route and they rebooked my evening flight to a morning flight. Would not work due to work so I received a refund to my credit card. Happy for the refund but not happy by the lack of options to rebook.    Trip 2: Seattle to Washington (IAD)  I booked this trip the same day as my Knoxville trip above. However, I paid a hefty price to stay loyal (+$75 over competitors) and I just found out that the price dropped for the flight by ~$70. And no, I can't get a refund of the difference. Tried cancelling (since there are no ""fees"" for cancelling) and I couldn't rebook for the same flight at the discounted rate, only the original rate I booked. Crazy thing is I had the same flight up on my phone and it had the discounted rate at the same time. This is the most confusing experience ever and I am not happy with the lack of support by United Customer Service.    Overall: I will never book United for my domestic needs ever again! STAY AWAY! The constant schedule changes and tricky ticketing practices make it impossible during these crazy times. I'll use them for international after COVID, but my god domestic is horrible."
Apr 3,40,Excellent COVID flight to Jacksonville,Excellent first class flight to Jacksonville. Smooth ride with polite but minimal service (drinks offered). Everyone wore masks. Flight left 15 minutes late to accommodate passengers coming off a late arrival flight but we arrived ten minutes ahead of time!
Apr 2,10,"Horrible service, costs me over $600","The night before the flight was to leave I get a notification that the first leg of my trip was delayed due to “pilot rest.” Fine, but because of this I will miss my connecting flight. Call customer service to make it right and after 1 hour (most of which was spent on hold) I’m told they can only give me a voucher for the first leg because the second was on time. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? I CANT MAKE THE SECOND LEG BECAUSE OF YOUR ERROR! So rather than lose that amount I took the entire $707 full trip refund. I was able to get to my third leg of the trip via American Airlines for $495. When I rebooked my last leg of the trip it was $777!! More than the entire flight was previously for only 1/8th of the distance. I will never fly United again. They’re practically thieves. Do yourself a favor and fly another airline."
Apr 2,10,Unexplained Seat Changes,"Noticed several days before scheduled flight that seat I had selected in economy plus while making the original reservation was purged from system. Attempted to call customer service but was required to leave a call back number due to heavy call volume. An hour later I wad contacted by a Customer Service Representative (CSR). I explained that I was traveling with my wife and had paid for the seats I had chosen for extra leg room. My wife's original seat upgrade was still in the system but mine was not. The CSR suggested moving me to a seat one row behind my wife's seat that was not extra leg room. Fortunately, I was logged into the United website and noticed that there were still two seats left that were together one row forward with extra leg room. I basically did the CSR's job since I did not want to sit separate from my wife. The CSR stated he would refund the $150.00 I paid for the seat upgrades for the inconvenience of being inexplicably bumped from my seat. Today, as I was checking in for the flight, I noticed that my wife and I had been bumped from our extra leg room seats once again on the same flight. This time we were separated by a row and on opposite sides of the aircraft in middle seats at the rear. After calling United to speak to a CSR, I was required to hold for 40 minutes. When I spoke to the CSR he said the plane was full and no other seats were available. Once again, it was promised that I would be receiving a seat refund in 7 to 14 days. No explanation was provided as to why I would be bumped from side by side extra leg room seats with my wife in the center of the aircraft to split middlegbb row seats at the rear of the plane. Wasted a total of over 2 hours of time dealing with this issue twice after I had selected and paid for specific seats at the time of the reservation. No offer of any kind to compensate me for the inconvenience. Absolutely unacceptable. Will not be choosing United again for travel plans unless they can rectify their reservation system to address this issue. Very unprofessional!"
Apr 2,10,Keeps Delaying flight for no reason,Keeps Delaying flights for no reason and changing my flight to another day. THIS IS THE 5TH TIME. Got my seat and when trying to check in they be like its changed. TRASH AIRLINE AVOID THEM AT ALL COST
Apr 2,10,Pick another company,I have nothing good to say about United. Twice I have been screwed over where they have completely change my flights as soon as I’ve arrived at the airport. When I ask why they never give a reason. This causes taking extra time off work and more money lost without compensation. I’m not one to ever write reviews and I strongly recommend picking another airline company.
Apr 1,10,Worse than Spirit,"They canceled our flight a month after we booked it, and rerouted us with 2 stops. Said the only other option was to take a flight a day later, or refund our tickets. By then, all other airlines had pumped up their prices. Called multiple times... each time with holds of 56min, 58 min, worst was a 2 hour and 8 minute call. After the third call they put us on a flight with 1 stop, no more direct flights. They are unapologetic regarding their abysmal service. Never ever ever flying United again. Even Spirit is better."
Apr 1,20,Sneaky practices,"I booked a family trip using United. Again, as a family, in the airport we were assigned different seats so we had to pay an additional 150 dollars for two seats so my wife and son could be together... The problem is that there is no one to talk to because the process is done thru the automated tellers... Hopefully the same thing will not happen on our way back home... Last time I travel with United..."
Mar 2021,20,Not Clean,"United Airlines supposedly has enhanced cleaning protocols due to COVID-19. Not on this flight! My seat was dirty, the seat back pocket had food left in it and the bathroom was a disaster, toilet paper on the floor, no paper towels. Perhaps they are clean for the first flight of the day but not subsequent flights."
Mar 2021,10,Worst Flight Experience Ever,"There are no words. Charged first class premium, flew decrepit RJ for 4+ hours ORD - RNO. Horrible food service, horrible seeding, horrible aircraft, overall horrible experience. I have flown deep discount airlines like Frontier and Allegiant. Much worse experience. Avoid at all cost."
Mar 2021,10,Canceled our flight. Left us stranded with no way to get home,They canceled out direct flight two weeks before departure. They then routed us through Houston with a 45 minute layover ( and terminal change ) and put us in coach. When I called to see about other flight options I spent five (5) hours on hold I wound up driving to the airport to speak to a ticketing agent. The ticketing agent told me that there were no options for me to go home and that there was no way I would make the connection so I had to cancel the flight and then rebook with another airline for double the price in coach class with a layover in Detroit. This is a disgusting way to do business and they should be ashamed of themselves. I would’ve been stranded with no way home for two days.
Mar 2021,50,had extensive experience with United Airlines,"My wife and I have extensive experience with United Airlines. The food was fine and the entertainment was good with many movies. Legroom was not very good and the seats could be more comfortable. The performance of the staff was good. It's just a flight from Cancun to Washington, the food was bad, just a few snacks, and no entertainment other than an app on the phone. But for long-haul flights, everything was fine. I would recommend them and fly with them again."
Mar 2021,30,"Normally average, below average during Covid","The flight itself was fine and flight attendants do everything they can onboard, but seat spacing is nonexistent at this point and pre-boarding procedures could definitely be improved to prevent crowding"
Mar 2021,10,Never again,"Me and my family had a health emergency, tried to change flight and not only did we have to pay the difference of what the ticket was valued that day but then 50$ extra for booking the original tickets with a travel agency! Never again with UNITED"
Mar 2021,20,Very uninspiring,"Like everyone, adapting to travel during Covid. At check in, representative did not fully read the entry requirements for my final destination. They allow visa eligible passengers and they do not require covid testing to enter. She read the part about ""entry not permitted"" but did not scroll to the ""exceptions."" She just seemed content to stop reading there. She was nice and conversation civil, but I felt I had to prompt her to read on more than I should have.    Polaris lounge still not open. United Club did give me a voucher for premium beverage.    Flight was late departing and ORD was pretty much closed at 8 p.m. (not a criticism of the airline, of course). Flight was mediocre at best. Usual 20 minutes of announcements after take off. Their service is minimized to interact as little as possible. I had to put in my drink order when ordered the meal, which they bring together. No refills, no follow up to see if you have everything. They serve and are gone. Breakfast was sad. Prepackaged fruit cup and prepackaged cold croissant.    My remaining flights were LH economy and premium economy. Quality and presentation of food was actually better than UA business."
Mar 2021,10,Packed like sardines with people wearing thin neck gators with their nose hanging out,Will fly Delta. Delta leaves a seat between passengers. We are packed on top of each other and the man next to my husband has bis nose hanging out of his lightweight neck guard he is wearing as a mask! Didn’t we give our tax dollars to bail out the airlines! They should leave seats between passengers and require real masks!
Mar 2021,10,No social distancing,"The flight was full and there were no measures taken for social distancing by the company or the attendents. Masks were mandatory but thats not the only thing needed during Covid. Only hand sanitizer wipes were given which I used to wipe down the tray tables and my seat.    Even while boarding, people just barged in the flight in no order and there was nothing done by the attendants to ensure social distancing.    I was uncomfortable during the entire 5 hour duration of my flight. I expected the airlines to book only alternate rows for passengers and maintain distance during Covid.  Will not be taking United airlines again espeically during Covid."
Mar 2021,10,Be careful with this scam company,"This company is a huge scam. Today they didnt allow me to board the flight to go home. I came to Cancun on March 19 from Moscow, Russia with a layover in Frankfurt for 5h. The reason why they denieded to board me today was that I didnt accomplish my quarantine (14 days) as a non US citizen as mentioned on their website. However, I was in a transit zone, that is not considered as Shenzhen union. So basically no information about these regulations was provided on their website that would make it clear for people like me who are trying to flight through the US back to their country."
Mar 2021,10,Customer service sucks!,"We purchased first class tickets for a trip and when they changed the aircraft bumped us to Economy. Totally unhelpful and pretty much tough Sh%%. I will NEVER purchase a ticket on United again, they are HORRIBLE!!!"
Mar 2021,10,flight,"terrible, flight delayed due to “no crew” and flight was uncomfortable, flight attendants were also impolite and service was not good."
Mar 2021,10,Come on man,I understand the policy I agreed to to fly concerning mask. I would like to add the first airline to lift this policy will receive my business in the future.
Mar 2021,10,"Terrible Customer Service, Quality, and Enjoyability","United Airlines is the worst airline I have ever been on. They refused to help my family and I and forced me into a line, where I’ve been standing for nearly an hour. They do not answer our questions properly, and just cram us into a line with no further context. Absolute 💩"
Mar 2021,40,Better than others,"Having to take an impromptu flight to Tucson from New York for emergency family issues we flew American to Tucson and United from Tucson to Houston then Houston to New York. This review is not about American however having flown American first then United home allowed for easy comparison and United’s service was for better. Things I like about United: the plane boarded from the back forward. This allowed for an efficient process. My husband and I almost always fly first class and have found that when the planes are boarded from the front people block the aisle impeding efficient boarding. However Military, Elite United members and First class Boarded early too. Esteban the first class flight attendant far exceeded our expectations he was efficient and for the first time thanks to him I learned why window shades need to be open during takeoff and landing. Thank you Esteban. If you fly United with him U2 will find out why. United served a satisfying tapas box And premium drinks. This embarkation rules were clearly explained and we deplaned five rows at a time from the front of the plane back. Because passengers were thoroughly informed of the process,all complied and it went smoothly. Nice job United airlines my wish is that other airlines would look at what you do and emulate it."
Mar 2021,10,Problems with new United Sarasota to Houston service,Hassles with charges for luggage that I had to spend and hour on the phone to United to get refunded. Pre-TSA not recognized and long lines.through security .
Mar 2021,10,Canceled without notifying us,"I have been burned by United many times before, and I think I have finally learned my lesson. Our family booked flights to Cairo on United/Lufthansa for this week. Four days before departure I checked the app to be sure everything was set, and I noticed the flight from Frankfurt to Cairo is missing. After three hours on the phone I was told the flight was canceled - no email, text or call to let me know. I asked what would have happened as Americans cannot stay in Germany due to COVID. The representative said we would have been placed on a flight back to the U.S. and then caught a flight to Cairo a few days later. This is United's solution. Of course, we had hotels and plans already booked on our set dates.    I then said I was willing to drive to Denver to catch a flight on the same dates as our originally plans at which point I was told that he can book these for me for an additional $1200 per ticket. Unbelievable... When I asked for a refund the representative agreed and said the money will be refunded in 10-14 days. I am holding my breath. This has to be the worst airline in the world."
Mar 2021,10,Horrible Customer Service,"United has somehow concluded that COVID means no customer service. I had 2 flights with United since the pandemic and both were awful experiences. Rude flight attendants. This flight in particular I even overheard the flight attendant mumbling sarcastically about me under her breath as I was walking away. At this point I don't even need top quality customer service, I would settle for the employee's just not being straight rude. This was 2nd and very last time flying United."
Mar 2021,10,Beware of bogus baggage fees when taking sports equipment on United,"On a recent trip to Cancun, we checked in to the fishing rods. It was designed to meet the specifications from the United website which is that it must be less than a total of 115 linear inches. It’s a total of 108” or 92” plus 4” plus 4”. The agent was about to check in the tube and a manager, Debi King, came over and insisted that they needed to charge for the tube. She said it couldn’t be more than 80 inches. I told her I had checked the policy and was sure it could be 115 total linear inches    She raised her voice, and when I asked her to actually check the policy she actually started shouting at me. I protested further, knowing that I was allowed to take the rod by the United package policy standards since this was not the United express flight and she got more vocal, embarrassingly so.    Seeing that if I was going to get to take the fishing rods at all, I would have to agree. I reluctantly did, and was told I was being charged a $100 fee.    Afterwards, with some time to check the policy again, it was clear I shouldn’t have been charged. I filed a complaint with United. They apologized for the agents behavior but would not refund the fees, even when I sent them video footage of the rod tube with measurements. I was shocked. I’ve been a loyal customer with them for over 20 years and the United mileage plus member for as long as I can remember. The agent clearly charged me based on the wrong information. But they wouldn’t correct her error.    I then went to dispute the charge on my United mileage plus credit card. The charge showed $200 instead of the $100 which I was told. Wow. Now it felt dishonest and vindictive.    I’m a reasonable guy and living in Denver United is often convenient for me. I’m sure I still will when the price is right and I need to. I fly a lot and I usually take those fishing rods with me. Whenever I can though, I’ll be looking at other options anytime we fly because United of the price has blown my trust. I understand a crabby agent making a mistake, even though it shouldn’t happen, but when the company itself doesn’t back up their own policies it’s a real issue."
Mar 2021,10,Absolute WORST airline ever!!!!!,"United has the ABSOLUTE WORST customer service I have ever experienced! I am a frequent traveler on other airlines, but had to take United during one of my trips. I cannot believe how horrible their hold times are, I was on hold three different times over an hour each time, and the agent hung up on me twice. I would NEVER recommend this airline to anyone. I think their business practices are unacceptable, and during covid, they refused to do a simple exchange. I have no words for this organization outside of DO NOT book with them!!"
Mar 2021,40,So Empty!,"The plane was really new, noticeably clean, and very empty. The inflight entertainment was expansive and easy to use. No complaints."
Mar 2021,10,Customer Service - Do they even understand what a customer is?!,"First off, we had 2 flights booked with them in 2020 both of which got cancelled. OK, not their fault. But they didn’t offer a full refund! We had to take credit where other airlines were giving refunds. Ok so we decided we’ll just rebook the same flights in 2021. Mind you we had booked first class tickets in 2020 since it was a special trip to celebrate our 25 anniversary. So we tried to book first class again; plenty of seats available but they cost more for 2021 than our original purchase in 2020! Ridiculous! So we booked premium economy since our credit didn’t cover the first class anymore and we booked nonstop. Well our nonstop got change to a 3 hour layover and a much later flight which gets us home 10 hours later! So I call and they have no other options for me. Will they upgrade me to first class to make it right, no. So not only did we not get our FC tickets, we also lost our nonstop flight, worse seats, long layovers, and have to pay for luggage. NEVER will I choose United again if given a choice. Other airlines understand customer service. I will pay more for other airlines to get the customer service especially when it matters in long flights like this and when trying to celebrate something special. We will be uncomfortable and stressed now for the flight instead of being able to truly enjoy that which has been planned for so long."
Mar 2021,10,NO CHANGE FEE BOOKING,this no change fee is a BIG FRAUD. I booked tickets for the family to go to Paris and thought since there is no change fee I can use the tickets for domestic travel.  however if the cost of the new ticket is less then that of the ticket initially purchased you lose all the money. Each of my tickets were 1350 each and if a book a domestic ticket for 500 well I lose the remaining 850 . BIG FRAUD while the airlines take free taxpayer money!!!!!
Mar 2021,10,A united flight is going to be my last option AFTER trying to avoid travelling. HORRENDOUS!,"I travelled from Seattle to Delhi on business class. Flight was routed through Chicago. The united flight attendants are not just some of the worst flight attendants, they are perhaps generally bad people. And its not one or two, its all of them. Here are some excerpts from the flight:    1. They wouldn't take my jacket to the closet. When asked, rude face and expression. I probably should have apologized for asking for business class service while traveling business class    2. They don't work. If I have an empty cup on my seat, it will remain on my seat until the end of time. They will sit in their attendant seats and chat away to glory for their 8 hour shift. and LOUDLY! But they wont work.    3. God forbid if you ask for something. I asked for a drink. First, they brought me completely different from what I asked for. I asked for one drink and they brought me 2 so they wouldn't have to come again. When I took the drink back to them, they took it and I kid you not, ""slammed"" 3 drinks in my hand. Perhaps frustrated that someone was asking them to do their job.    4. Wake me up while sleeping. Usually airlines will ask you whether you want to be woken up or not if you are sleeping and they would make sure you have a comfortable experience. United does it a little differently. They don't ask you. They just wake you. Even if its for an extremely small thing and not even a meal    4. I tried to attribute all of this to racism. And thought that they just want to treat Indian people differently. But I was completely wrong. My american colleagues were in the subsequent flights. and they had similar or worse experiences. That's 3 business passengers that United just turned off from flying them again."
Mar 2021,10,Terrible communication,"We just returned from a ski trip to Colorado. Our outbound flight was canceled due to snow storm. We were issued minimal refund for this flight that the weather canceled, not United fault but I should not pay for a flight I could not use and had to pay extra to another airline to fly into another airport that was open.  Then our return flight was increased in price as we had to fly out on a different airline.  Returning our aircraft broke not their fault this happens but through terrible communication we were promised another plane was coming to bring us home. We sat in the airport all day waiting for the new plane to arrive. When we boarded the plane they told us the crew had no time left to fly us home. They should have known how many hours the crew had left to fly that day. We were then bused to a busted motel that then told us we could not stay as United did not pay them the last time they had people stay there. We then bussed back to the airport. We were then put in an even worse motel I asked the agent if she would stay there with her kids and she said no. We had to stay in an incredibly unsafe motel overnight. Then the next day we were finally able to fly home and did not get our upgraded seats. We were then given minimal travel credit to use on future flights. Obviously will never use this airline again."
Mar 2021,20,Not an airline I look forward to flying on,"Early departure on a midweek flight should be easier than this. Long lines at ticket counter and only one agent to assist customers guarantees an anxiety filled start to the travel day. Of the four kiosks available, one was out of service, 2 could not complete transactions for the customers ahead of us and the fourth was being utilized by the agent for check-in assistance....recommend on-line check in for this airport and hope you don't have to check bags. Arrival at DEN the UA Express aircraft routinely park at the far end of the B terminal....long, long. long walk to the center core to catch train to the terminal or connecting gate.."
Mar 2021,50,Love it!,Best trip I was very relax and comfortable 1000000 times better then spirit airlines  My next trip will be with United airlines...  I will recommend my friends about United airlines
Mar 2021,20,COVID virus,Went to Hawaii empty seat between us. On the back no empty seat . We where stuff in like sardines. They didn’t care about COVID safety. We sat next to people we didn’t know . When u eat and drink no mask. United must think the COVID virus is over. No procedure for COVID safety. Check another airline. United don’t care.......
Mar 2021,10,Worst flight ever,"This was our first time flying United and it was the worst flight experience I’ve had. United set us up to fail from the beginning. This airline was concerned with how I was wearing my mask more than me safely boarding my flight in time. We flew from San Antonio to Boise with our connecting flight in Denver. Our first flight boarded 20 minutes late, which was announced by United on my United app to be due to waiting for passengers from the plane’s previous flight. After boarding, they announced the flight would be 35 more minutes late due to technical difficulties. During the flight we expressed our concern about missing our flight and the flight attendant said they knew we were late and our next flight would wait for us. While in the air, I messaged United through the app and did not receive a response in time. We were not allowed to get off the plane first, but once we did we sprinted from B37 to A77 (and almost passed out having to wear masks) in Denver’s airport (including a train ride), but they had boarded without us, even though we got there at 3:43 and the flight was scheduled to leave at 3:45. Oh yeah and they gave us $10 food vouchers that bought us some charred (aka burnt) brussel sprouts. Thanks United. If I could give them 0 stars I would."
Mar 2021,20,Blown chance to make customers feel special,I’m amazed looking at this flight to Roatan that the front 20 rows are almost devoid of people flying. Here was a fantastic opportunity for United to have their customers (those that keep them flying) move up to the comfortable seats up front. What a great gesture it would have been to make the folks in the back of the plane feel like valued and special people when the plane was empty. These are the types of oversights and missed opportunities that will eventually reflect on United’s bottom line.
Mar 2021,10,First Class is not necessarilly first clase,"It turns out that in First Class the 1K members get preferential treatment even though you may have paid for a full price first class ticket. The flight attendant was skipping around the cabin taking food orders from only the 1K members first, So even though you pay full price first class rates you are treated like a second class citizen. Now, I understand that United is going to conceal this practice by taking all food orders at the same pass, then later sorting out the 1K members and giving them their choice, and the non-1K first class passengers get what is left over. So, if the person behind you and the person in front of you get the chicken sandwich you wanted, it's because they are 1K and you are not.    They should really be forced to disclose this practice so people can decide whether to fly United, or not, or to simply go ""no-frills""    In addition, they advertised ""leaving the middle seat open"" to minimize your exposure to Covid, then as soon as they cut back the flights enough to fill the middle seat, it changes to you can take the next flight if you don't like the middle seat next to you being filled.    United abuses its leading market share to take advantage of its customers at every turn. Fly another airline if you possibly can."
Mar 2021,10,Terrible customer service when using credit,"Zero stars. Cannot recommend. Had tickets booked for thanksgiving but had to cancel due to covid. Was forced to pay a fee in order to keep the ""credit"" for this flight to rebook at a later date. There is no way to use credit online through their site, you must call one of their booking agents. I had pulled up the flight I wanted on their website and could see that the price was significantly less than my credit, however the booking agent still charged me another $100, assuring me that I owed more money and could not explain why her price differed from what I could see with my own eyes. She assured me she would be passing on my concerns and someone would be in touch to explain, that never happened.  To make matters worse, my return flight was cancelled due to weather and their online options for choosing a new flight are TERRIBLE. My flight was cancelled twice with email notifications. On the day I was flying out I found out AT CHECKIN that my new return flight was also cancelled!!! There had been zero email or text notification. Thank goodness we happened to be at the airport extremely early and were able to choose a new flight at the kiosk but this was absolutely abysmal customer service on their part with the lack of fore-notice.  I will never fly with them again."
Mar 2021,10,A 3 hour delay on a clear day. From ORD,How can United Airlines not come up with a flight crew from Chicago for a simple hop to Boston. What a clown show!
Mar 2021,50,Wonderful Experience,"I have been traveling united for last 10 years at least but experienced something unique this time so thought of sharing here. I traveled from Houston to Delhi to attend a family emergency and forgot my headphones on the flight at delhi airport. United Lost & Found somehow got hold of my headphones and made an entry in the system. These headphones were gifted by a family member and were priceless for me. on my return journey, i requested two United associates (Kapil Yadav & Puneet Khatkar) on the delhi airport to find my headphones and in spite of their busy schedule they tried but couldn't find them. They assured that they will keep trying so i came back to US. After a few days, i got an email from Kapil and Puneet that they finally located my headphones and apparently there was some date error in the system that caused the confusion. finally yesterday, i received my headphones back through FEDEX at my home address in US. Wonderful gesture and i am very thankful to Kapil, Puneet and United Airlines."
Mar 2021,20,No departure notice of flight cancelled.,"Hello fellow travelers.    Unfortunately, after reaching out to United Airlines feedback (Stephanie). With only a sorry response to a United Airlines credit card holder.    I am writing about my negative experience.  January 2021 I made a reservation to Liberia, Costa Rica and a return from San Jose, CR for two. In March 2021 the day of my departure I called UA customer service and find out that my flight was cancelled with no notification after an 1/2 hold time on the phone. No more flights to Liberia that day only to San Jose at a later time. I had to cancel my Airbnb room, Payless car rental and a fishing charter out of Playa del Coco. I had to forfeit deposit money as well as lost a day of our vacation.    If you read this never assume your departure flight is a go without checking way in advance of that date. Good luck and happy travels.    Best regards,    Bill Kiley"
Mar 2021,50,Excellent Customer Service,"Under the pressure of COVD and rules changing daily the pressure these employees go through is insane, yet they all have kept there heads up, friendly service to help and stay in compliance. I had to miss three flights due to circumstance out of control. COVD testing getting back late, change flights, a freak winter storm that delayed over another 2 days, government issuing confusing messages. With all the phone calls and standing with desk agents in three states and two countries all her professional and courteous. HIGH FIVES all around. Well Done."
Mar 2021,10,Scam! Customer service and certificate pins a scam!!!,United Airlines allegedly must have someone working on the inside using ( COVID-19 cancellations with reimbursements ) for customers .
Mar 2021,10,Delays on delays,Pretty bad in terms of delays - tried to blame on weather but was due to the fact that they overbooked and didn’t have catering ready - 2 hour delay so everyone could get one of their horrible crackers!!!
Mar 2021,10,Flight Cancelations,"My family and I took a spring break vacation to Flagstaff Arizona. The flights there were fine despite the flight attendants being a little cranky. We got here and our flight back got cancelled. We frantically found another. This one was a day later than the first. It gets cancelled day of. We try again, book it. It gets cancelled. They are no help in finding other ways to get you home. We needed a flight back to Omaha or Lincoln. Looked into Kansas City even. Nothing for a few days. We are all missing work, college, and high school for this. Important things are going on back home that we can not attend and will have consequences for. All I have to say is don't fly with them if you want your trip to be as stress free as possible. My family is beyond over this vacation."
Mar 2021,10,Changed flight without authorization or notification,"I just flew back from Florida and thank God I called to check in to my flight the night before! When I called they told me my flight was changed to fly out on a completely different date and with a layover, which was not my original ticket. When I tried to get switched back to my original flight which I booked in December, I was told there were no longer seats available and my flight was full. I was able to fly out from Orlando with a connection in Houston, arrived late to Chicago. On top of it my daughter suffers from inner ear problems and that’s why we never fly with a connection, the landing is incredibly painful for her. So now she had to suffer through 2 landings. Flight from Houston was horrible, packed, people not wearing masks and putting others at risk and United did nothing. They did nothing to try to help me! They acted like they were doing me a favor by getting me on a flight through Houston when it was their error in the first place. They wanted to compensate me $100 for the inconvenience, but acted like this was going above and beyond to rectify the situation. I really just wanted back on. The flight I purchased. I’m not sure how they could just switch someone’s flight without authorization and not even send me a notification. If I did not check in the night before and discover the error I would have been stuck in the airport with 2 children for 24 hours. They really do not care about inconveniencing any one. The bottom line is not quality of service , it’s all about how much money they can make for themselves. Who cares about the customer!"
Mar 2021,10,Not following federal mandate no masks,I flew a packed flight in February from Houston to Chicago. 2 men refused to wear masks and United did not care. No announcement was made to wear masks and attendants walked by and refused to notice. Attendants seemed exhausted and carefree about regulations.
Mar 2021,10,United Airlines is the Worst Airline Available (Would give 0 stars for service”,"I had booked a flight in early 2020 before the pandemic hit, obviously everything got cancelled. United gave me a credit or voucher type of thing. I tried booking a new flight and it wouldn’t let me add my minor children, and when I called them, the customer service was horrid. The agent was super rude with no patience at all. I would not recommend United Airlines and every time I have flown with United I have always had a bad experience! I cannot stress this enough: the customer service deserves a negative rating!"
Mar 2021,10,LOST LUGGAGE - BARELY ANY SETTLEMENT!!,"LOST $5K WORTH OF LUGGAGE IN JANUARY 2021 AND ONLY AGREED TO REIMBURSE $1900!!    Flying international in December 2019 - January 2021. Lost one of my two bags. Pre-approved me for delayed bag expenses totaling approximately $650. 7 weeks later, yes SEVEN WEEKS they made me wait!! Never paid the expenses, never sent me a settlement letter or email. Mailed me a check for a mere $1900. Called them many times, supervisors won't take my call and claims won't respond to emails. Said claim is settled. I submitted a claim for almost $5K 6 weeks prior, even submitted receipts for items exceeding $100. HORRIBLE! DO NOT FLY! They will lose your luggage and not return phone calls/emails, and only reimburse you pennies on the dollar and NO expenses."
Mar 2021,50,IAD 49 minute layover,I have a 49 minute layover in IAD. Both the flight from BUF to IAD and IAD to MYR are regional flights on an RJ-145. Is 49 minutes enough of a layover? I looked at the map and it looks like IAD has the United Regional Flights gates all in one section?
Mar 2021,10,Change to Flight without notification,"I originally booked a non stop flight from SFO to MCO on April1,2021. I have a group of 12 passengers flying with United at the same time on the same flight. United has changed my flight with out a notification. The reason I selected the non stop flight is due to my daughter has anxiety traveling. Now we have a stop in IAH which I did not want to stop. The changes to this flight requires us to get a hotel now which is a big inconvenience. We was arriving in MCO at 7:15am on 4/2/21. Now United has us traveling for 8 hours with a stop in IAH and arriving in MCO at 11:00pm on 4/1/21. I have to make a lot of changes to my schedule with a group of 12 passengers. This is not considered to the passengers who made the reservation and booking the flight red eye so folks will not miss work nor school. I have to change my transportation to the airport.    The reason its so upsetting is because we had other options to travel with. Now we stuck traveling with United due to prices has went up on other airlines.    This is the 2nd time United has changed my flight within a year to what its best for them. The reason for booking ahead of time is for proper preparation. I never received a email notification on the changes but I did received the confirmation email.    Trying to address the issue with United. I was on hold for 45 minutes.  United just lost a loyal customer."
Mar 2021,20,Disappointed,My family has been a loyal costumer and has bought hundreds of thousands of dollars in flights over the years. Recently it seems as if United airline simply does not care about its costumers and constantly cancels or delays their flights without notice. Additionally after these cancelations I have had multiple encounters with rude and unhelpful costumer service representatives. They need to step it up cause as of now I’m switching to delta.
Mar 2021,10,This company is the biggest excuse for a airline transportation ways,"Me and my wife planned a honeymoon to Mexico this coming April 2021. United changed our flights without notice and gave us a missconecton flight. After trying all their ways of communication, and be on hold for over 3 hours. They didn’t offer other another way, they just canceled the flight. Now I had to cancel my whole vacation that was planned over 6 month ago. Without even an apology! Sucks!"
Mar 2021,10,Nontransparent flight change policy - Abysmal CS,"The company alleges that in Covid time you can easily change your flight, or cancel it and get flight credit for the unused ticket . Yet, once you do it, their system makes it impossible to know HOW MUCH credit you actually have left (we cancelled the return portion of the flight and wanted to book it for another date).    To make it more frustrating, it is impossible for you yourself to book the new flight through their online system using this (unidentifiable) credit - you need to call their CS.    Waiting time for CS  Phone: 1,5-2 HOURS  Social media: they respond every 30-60 MINUTES to EACH of your FB messages, making it completely useless, unless you have nothing else to do all day (or two) but stare at your messenger inbox.    Luckily, you happen to have a lot of time in your pointless pandemic existence, so after a mere couple of hours of mentally dancing to their MOH, you may reach an agent (working in some call-mine at another part of the planet), but they will prove not be very helpful, since the price for the new flight that they suggest for you happens to be different (and about $50 higher) than the SAME flight you're seeing with your own eyes online while talking to them.    In the end, the price for you flight change will end up being the same as buying a new ticket altogether, as if you had no remaining flight credit at all.    So, after half a day of a terribly frustrating chasing UA CS and any useful information, we have decided to book new tickets, but with a DIFFERENT airline, and will make sure we never fly UA again."
Mar 2021,20,United Airlines Treats 1st Class the worst!,"I have to tell ya, I paid for a 1st Class Roundtrip ticket from Tucson to Kansas City recently on UNITED Airlines and have had a real NIGHTMARE! On the return trip I was delayed due to unforeseeable problems and had to reschedule. I couldn't get the computer to recognize my ""Code""> So I phoned United and the rep was able to pull up the trip, no problem, however he rebooked my trip back to Tucson and took me OUT OF 1st CLASS and put me in ECONOMY although there were plenty of seats in FIRST CLASS! He asked if I had a preference in seats, I said NO. And there were plenty of seats either way. So why did he put me in Economy? I don't know? When I got to the airport was when I found out, the gentleman at the counter told me I owed $35 for my bag and I hit the roof when I realized what had happened! So I asked the charge to get my seat back and he said $99 for both my seat to Denver and the seat on the plane Denver to Tucson so that's $198! He suggested that when I arrived back in Tucson I contact Cust service I explain what had happened, offer my supporting information/documents proving I had paid for my FIRST CLASS TICKETS and ask for a refund. SO I HAVE DONE THAT. Guess what has happened? Besides getting a royal runaround I received a ""Credit"" for the first leg of the trip for $99, but then nothing for the second part of my trip at all. When I complained because I didn't want a ""CREDIT"" at all I wanted a REFUND! I spoke with a very understanding lady and thought I was finally getting somewhere, she said I would be getting a refund and gave me information about #'s etc. Well guess how much my refund ended up being? They refunded the so called ""Cost difference in flight ticket"" which I could have never paid OF COURSE but this is some sort of INTERNAL COST I suppose....I was refunded $25! THIS is how they treat their 1st Class passengers in a pandemic who are trying to support the airlines! THANKS A LOT UNITED AIRLINES! I'M GOING TO POST AND REPOST this on Google-TripAdviser-And everywhere I can think of. It's a real shame. I have always preferred to fly on your airlines, with your crews, but I doubt I will ever again over so little. One more thing, they gave us a Stroopwafel (super sweet cookie) 1/2 oz of tiny pretzels and 8 oz btl of water for both flights as our ""Snack"" one could have starved to death! We had ""free drinks"" so I guess that was supposed to make up for everything! (LOL) Our crew was great, it's just such a shame."
Mar 2021,10,No effort to give customer an enjoyable experience,"5-hour flight from Cancun to LAX - no entertainment! I'm not even talking about a personal screen--there wasn't even an old-school armrest radio channel-changer--nothing. No headphone jack at all. Yes, supposedly they have a wifi entertainment service so you can drain your phone's battery trying to connect to it, which most of the time I couldn't.  Worst turbulence of our lives with no effort on part of flight crew to provide reassurance.  Otherwise this seemed like a new-ish plane that had average legroom and could've been decent."
Mar 2021,50,I like them. But I get every flight can be very different,I have made it a choice to fly united for the foreseeable future. I like them. There comparable to American airlines and definitely a step above flights like spirit. With the pandemic I like to fly first class because of the space and less of a chance of being sandwiched between to random people. The meals in first class right now a joke but the service is still pretty good.
Mar 2021,20,BAD AND FLIGHTS ALWAYS CANCELED,Terrible flight! We boarded and then the flight was canceled which costed another 3k! Food is not free either.
Mar 2021,10,Not worth it,Miserable....I wouldn't wish such a horrible experience on any human being. Tiny seats...no storage...no service....united does NOT care about you...all they care about is taking your money.
Mar 2021,10,Did not guarantee a flight I booked months in advance!!! BEWARE,"I booked a flight months in advance, rented an apartment, bought winter clothes, and had an appointment for a civil union hinging on my travel date. There should not be a problem with guaranteeing the flight I paid for months in advance. I talked for 2 hours with customer service and patiently waited either on hold or while the agent looked for reasonable solutions. The best they could come up with was an overnight layover WEEKS after my intended date with no compensation for my time or money lost on rent. Additionally the management was rude and unsympathetic when I was explaining how stressed out I was over this bungle. DO NOT FLY UNITED, USE ANYTHING ELSE"
Mar 2021,10,Non-compliance with federal mask regulations,ok overall but blatant non-compliance with making sure passengers wear a mask correctly. Flight attendants walk by the passengers with masks that dont fit and do not cover the nose because they are worn incorrectly and ignore the issue completely. I would not recommend this airline. Depends of the flight but reflects badly on the overall culture
Mar 2021,10,HORRIBLE SERVICE,"Have an international flight from Amritsar to Austin with a layover in Delhi San Francisco. Almost 27 hours of journey with the layovers, and the trip has been delayed by 10 hours with the flight being diverted to Frankfurt. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! no provision for the next flight, will have to wait for the next available layover after immigration. Tiredness stretched beyond any human limit! United should compensate its flyers for the mental and physical torture"
Mar 2021,30,Room for improvement to the chaotic boarding process.,"This was my first time on United Airlines. Check-in desk opened four hours before departure. The process was quick and efficient. Earlier, one of the staff physically checked the print out of the Covid-19 test result and then you sign a declaration that you have had a negative test. This declaration gets retained at check-in.    Security reverted to pre-Covid-19 days and social distancing was not evident along with brazen attempts at queue jumping. Disappointed that there was no attempt to enforce sensible Covid-19 protocol.    The GVK lounge is used by many airlines including United. The usual buffet spread was not available as it was Covid-19 time. Someone took your order and brought the food in a cardboard box. Drinks were also available. This is how it is done in other airports too. Quite understandable in the circumstances and entirely adequate.    Boarding was declared on the screen in the lounge and on reaching the gate, it was total confusion! Boarding was en masse, free for all! It was not in any particular order even though the groups for boarding were printed on boarding cards. It could have been much better if there were separate queues for premium and economy. Strangely boarding was neither by class nor row numbers. Social distancing was non-existent.    This lack of order was continued at the next step which was a totally pointless exercise when all carry-on bags were once again, x-ray screened, with electronic items in trays.    Finally, one gets into the aircraft and the rest of the flight was five star.    Even though United did not offer special meals on this flight, the stewardess had the list of ingredients for their dinner menu available, which was very useful. (The website says that special meals were not available - being confined only to kosher meals between TLV and EWR).    United Airlines has lost stars for its very chaotic boarding process. Surely, there’s room for improvement in this area! They need to do better..."
Mar 2021,10,Horrible staff discriminates,"We were checking out our bags, not late at all, and one of the ladies said we were “too late” but continues to let other people go, but not us. She takes us to another woman who also does not let us go and gives us another boarding pass for a different flight. We went to boarding, but there were no seats left for us, and the lady never told us. They told us we would get our bags from the carousel, but they took our suitcases to Fresno and now we have no clothes or anything. Worst. Day. Ever. I will never be taking this airline again."
Mar 2021,50,Ms.,"My experience with United airlines is wonderful all of the time. The flight from Dayton to Chicago and the flight from Chicago to Colorado was so very smooth they were the smoothest flights I’ve had in years. The flight attendant who was a tall, blonde, very nice scarf believe it was blue and green and white her hair was up, I think she had glasses on. She was so nice and courteous throughout the flight and when I depart at my flight my shoestring was untied. She said let me a tie your shoe before you fall.She bent down in her skirt and heels and tied my shoe before I left the airplane. That was so nice of her I was in awe along with all the passengers that were behind me waiting so patiently thank you thank you"
Mar 2021,10,Sir,Screw United Airlines and their mask policy. Throwing a family off on their way home because their 2 year old wouldn't wear a mask? They deserve bankruptcy.
Mar 2021,10,Killed my bags,Ok I had a new bag hard case first time flying with my new luggage They rubbed it in mud it looks like and then broke off both the wheels then I had to go to the airport five or six times back-and-forth until they offered me a used piece of luggage and that’s all my options are so I am stuck with it and have to take it tonight he can suck a big fat one
Mar 2021,10,Horrible customer service,I tried to cancel a booking with 12 hours because they wouldn’t allow me to use my credit online. I could only use the credit over the phone and the representative wouldn’t allow me to chose the flights I wanted. I could only chose select flights which didn’t suit my needs. I decided to cancel and they would not allow me to be refunded.    I won’t fly United again.
Mar 2021,50,Lightening fast refund,"I just wrote a scathing review of TAP who hasn't issued refunds for flights cancelled in May. So, it seems right that I should relate the far different experience I had with United.    When I called in late May I got right through and gave my name and flight info. I'd barely hung up the phone when the refund showed up on my credit card. About five minutes start to finish."
Mar 2021,10,Rude and impatient,Where do I start? They charge for baggage. Rude stewardess on plane. Rude customer service wouldn't listen after they would not deliver my baggage and said it was my error. I never want to travel with them again.
Mar 2021,20,United Lacking Good Customer Service,"Very disappointed in United’s customer service. Our flight was cancelled from Alaska, so we booked a flight with United. Turned out Alaska was able to transfer our reservation to United, which we were extremely grateful for. We didn’t cancel our first reservation, just in case something went wrong and wanted to confirm with United at the check in counter that everything was set. We get there, explain what happened, that we are double booked and need to cancel the one ticket. The lady at the counter tells us we should not do it on our end, that she will cancel the extra flight, and not to worry about it. Well a week later we are getting charged for that flight and United refuses to acknowledge what happened and that someone from their own company told us to not cancel on our end and that they would take care of it. Nothing was taken care of, and I recommend people be careful trusting what United has to say to them. We were just trying to do the right thing by cancelling through the United check in counter right away, so that other people in similar situations could get a spot on that flight. Very disappointed that trying to do things the right way cost us a bunch of money."
Mar 2021,40,My united experience,"Ive never flown before so i was of course terrified. I also brought my 1.5 month old so i knew it was going to be hectic. I got to reading reviews of horror stories and made me even more nervous. I came here to write a review to let others know it really depends on the person and their day. My flight was great , i had the most help and they even let me bring my sons carseat on board cause my whole row was empty. Had a safe travel and look forward to flying back home with them. Only thing i can really complain about is the comfort in the seats. They suck ."
Mar 2021,10,Clear discrimination between the customer and the flight attendants,I had my flight yesterday. We checked in and arrive at the terminal gate 10 mins before the flight. We begged them to let us in as it was crucial for us to reach Newark. One of the flight attendants arrived later than us. He was easily allowed to enter in but we were stuck outside. Wow-what great customer service.
Mar 2021,10,Big scam and poor customer service,"I booked a flight for business purpose to Canada with a stopover in New York. I booked online and I was able to enter all my data (name, country of residence, passport etc...) so the booking went smoothly.    Then I went to the airport on the day to catch my flight, and what a surprise and indignation when an agent of this pitiful airline told me that I couldn't board because the United States doesn't receive any foreign passengers at the moment, even for a stopover to join Canada!    So was it normal that I was able to buy a ticket?  Why are such tickets to other countries than United States with a stopover in the United States still on sale if stopover there are not allowed ?    I was on my way to Canada for work, so I was devastated that I couldn't get there. I burst into tears, but the agents simply gave me the number of their customer service department. And this service couldn't find any solution for me, and dared to tell me that it was my fault because I had bought these tickets myself on a travel agency without knowing that the United States no longer welcomed visitors with a stopover. And absolutely nobody apologised for this terrible mistake!    The real problem is that such tickets are still available for sale! And when you know that the airline company (United Airlines) makes a profit from the sale of these tickets, you can conclude that they are thieves!    Don't book with this airline! They don't care about their customers and will never do anything to help you, even if you are hopeless."
Mar 2021,10,United Airlines ROBBED ME- REFUSES TO REFUND AFTER THEY CANCEL MY FLIGHT DUE TO COVID,AVOID booking United Airlines and/or their Silver Airways partners AT ALL COSTS. This airline royally screwed me as I had booked a trip last year to key west on silver and they cancelled on me due to covid. They explained that they would refund me a travel certificate of $340 and I could rebook at my convenience. So you can imagine my dismay when I decided to rebook for the same postponed trip...and was informed my certificate is only valid for United flights and NOT silver airways. Oh and did I mention only silver Airways flies to key west?? 😂 HA neither did they. When I called customer service they told me to file a case number so I did and never received a call back. #straightrobbery
Mar 2021,10,Horrible Travel Experience,Just had the worst travel experience of my life. Flight was delayed 5 hours for technical difficulties (received approx. 10 delay notifications over that timeframe) which caused us to miss our connecting flight and baggage was lost to boot.
Mar 2021,10,Might need an extra 5 or 6 hours,We got to the Airport forty minutes before boarding time had boarding passes ready get in line to board AT 6;35 a.m. and then there was a problem with the bathroom. We didn't get to leave until 8:45 a.m. So this delay of theirs caused us to miss our connecting flight which they said that they would hold the plane for us but by the time we grabbed our carry on bags and got to the gate they left without us. They sent us to customer service which told us they wouldn't have a flight for us for another 4 hrs and 25 min so we had to sit in the Huston Airport for 4 and a half hours waiting on the next flight out. So if you make plans where you need to arrive at a certain time might want to factor in an extra 5 or 6 hours if you plan on flying with United.
Mar 2021,10,"""basic economy""? More like a f****g joke to try and scam you!","To summarize everything id REALLY like to type up...just know that when it comes to cheap fare and trying to market the ""BASIC economy"", United Airlines really f****d this up! NOT EVEN Spirit nor Frontier Airlines has pulled this crap before, much less American Airlines basic economy bends you over at the ticket counter and tells you to screw off! Apparently you can not check in and get a guaranteed seat, EVEN THOUGH the email you get confirmed gives you seat number (1st RED FLAG of false advertisement) then when trying to check in via your mobile app you cant check in since you don't rate a check in bag, ONLY if you pay the extra $40+ to check a bag in. Even if you have a carry on, it wont count and still cannot fully check in until you get to the terminal. Even attempting to throw money at them, they can't allow you to take a carry-on the plane once their check in time is over (45 mins prior to boarding) which is complete horsesh** since they still load planes with bags even while the people are boarding into the plane! I will definitely not be flying United Craplines anymore, and will make sure my friends and family do the same! Silly of me to deviate to try to save a few dollars from the best airline in the game...Southwest Airlines!"
Feb 2021,10,Mr,Manage Reservation with agents in Philippines is impossible .. web site is also terrible..spend 3x30 min on the phone ..and same on line .  Next time DELTA!!!!
Feb 2021,10,My minor kids were not seated with me-DATE: JUNE 2019,"The date for this trip is June 2020 but it was actually June 2019. I didn’t have the option to put 2019. This review is long overdue. I was traveling with my kids at the time was 6,5, and 3 years old. The rule is that they would sit parents with there minor children regardless. Didn’t happen for me. The agents told me I should of booked earlier, and someone will help us on the plane. When we got on the plane no one helped us until finally someone volunteered to switch seats with my husband. It was awful."
Feb 2021,10,military deployment leave,"my son booked a flight for his predeployment leave. Unfortunately with the military things are subject to change. flight was already booked and 30 hours later command pushed the date of return up. tried calling to change the reservation. started with a 1/2 hour hold time to then be put on hold by the csr statng her computer was loading...that took another 20 minutes. she finally came back on and said that would be an additional $1285.00. I obviously said absolutley NOT, better recheck that. yep! another 10 mnute hold. (computer still loading) came back on and said it would be an additional 385.00. i tried to explain that he is in the Marine Corp, orders changed and i am looking at the exact same flight on EXPEDIA whch was quoting me $192.00. finally gave up and said i will book the return flight from expedia..... made the mistake of asking this nitwit if he would receiveany credit for the unused return flight....needless to say i was given long winded explanation that made zero sense...when asked to calrify, a completely different answer. told her good night and FLY AMERICAN. AMERICAN airlines is military friendly."
Feb 2021,50,Over and above care,"My 90 year old mother-in-law was determined to visit her son in the U.S. She experienced low oxygen and pain during the flight. The inflight service crew immediately addressed her discomfort. Due to their swift and considerate actions, she arrived in Newark safely. I can not thank them enough. I believe they literally saved her life."
Feb 2021,10,Worst Customer Service and Refund department Agents,Worst customer service and refund department agents. Agents can not process a simple flight segment cancellation issue.
Feb 2021,10,Terrible airline,Skip this airline! It’s just a rip off. Empty seats and charge for everything. Spend more money to go with a better airline.
Feb 2021,50,I really came to love this airline.,"First of all let me talk about the customer care at the check in counter of Dayton, OH. They are the best really. They will go above and beyond to help you with any issue."
Feb 2021,10,Customer service,They changed my seat to a row toward the end and told me that's for social distancing and there's no one next to me only to go there and find the row occupied lol... I've been avoiding UA during pandemic for failure to learn from Delta and will do as much as possible in the future as well...
Feb 2021,10,Cut corners in maintenance,"I’ve had the misfortune of having a company home office be accessible mainly by United Airlines. I’ve been on two flights that had to make emergency landings due to maintenance issues, and others that were delayed as they had to switch out broken planes. How important is safety to you?"
Feb 2021,10,Flight cancellation due to COVID,"I purchased a ticket December 2019 for July 2020. We all know what happened in March 2020. In April, I canceled. Because I made my reservation well in advance for 2020, I lose. Anyone that waited and made it in February 2020 has a two year grace period. I argue that any reservation for 2020 should have a two year grace period no matter when the reservation was made. I've been on the phone for three hours about this. I am being charge $200 per ticket for this July. This is wrong and I am totally disgusted with this airline."
Feb 2021,10,United Airlines keep getting worse by the minute,"The airplane was freezing, I asked if I could get a blanket and flight attendant denied me of the blanket, I was told that the blankets are only for first class passengers only. I asked to turn up the heat, everybody was complaining and they never did. Once I arrived I got terrible cold from that flight. I would not fly with United airlines ever again, and if you are reading this review please do not fly with them. I used to fly with them a few years ago and now that they are under new management the company drive was all about profit and forgot or didn’t care about customers. The service got worse, and kept getting worse till this day."
Feb 2021,10,Just poorly run,"We used UA from Killeen, Tx, to Omaha for the first time. Our trip up (via Houston) was fine. However, then the bad weather hit. We understood when they canceled our first Houston-Killeen flight. We waited and rebooked a flight for 4 days later. The weather is warm now and no snow problems. However, United canceled our Houston-Killeen flight (set for 7:50 pm) at 12 noon. They rebooked us for the next day. Unacceptable. We are now taking a Southwest flight home. The difference between United and Southwest is incredible. Use Southwest if you can."
Feb 2021,10,You will regret buying a UNITED AIRLINES TICKET,Don't do it. UA hates customers. Run from UA. I still have PTSD from my nightmare with them so not gonna relive it here. But mark my words you will regret doing business with UA in Wilmington NC
Feb 2021,30,Really Rather Not,"We started our trip in Economy Plus. We spent the extra money so we would have a little more room to move around. We may as well have been in the seats in the back by the bathroom - at least then we wouldn't feel robbed. The seats felt like sitting on plywood. We upgraded to 1st class on the way back hoping for more comfort. It was ok, but not worth the money. The attendant service was lacking on all of our flights, except one. We would avoid this airline in the future if we had another option."
Feb 2021,10,Winter Storm = no flights for days = almost died trying to figure it out....,"I wanted to NOT be booked for same day due to the storm,, but no one listened to us. UA filled the flights while we waited for their rebooted canceled flight. Then we would have had to miss 2 more days of work! Refund? Voucher you say? For a flight we never even took? NOPE. While the other airlines they booked us on answers their phone right away that night, UA had a two hour wait. Never will fly UA again."
Feb 2021,50,I love United’s phone agents,"I know it’s popular to throw shade at United, but one area where they beat almost every other company is in their phone representatives. I love them so much. They consistently go beyond expectations to make sure I’m happy and get what I want, even when I may not even deserve it sometimes. Other companies have an occasional all star, but United’s phone center is filled with nothing but stars. I also think the airline as a whole has handled COVID better than just about anyone. Keep up the wins, United!"
Feb 2021,10,Nothing but common thieves.,I just found out United workers are allowed to steal electronics out if your checked bag. I was told that they don't cover any kind of electronics even though they were stolen. Why should I pay to check a bag just to have you people rummage through it and take my personal belongings?!?
Feb 2021,10,Worst Airline ever.,"Worst airline ever. Do not choose United if you have any deadline at all, as you can expect long delays."
Feb 2021,50,Exemptional Customer Service,"I hardly write a review but today Ms. KERRIE O. REILLY & Mr. STEVEN DYKE(Dayton, OH,Ticket Counter) deserve a recognition. My flight was canceled on my bday, but they work so hard and patiently looked for available flights. There's a lot of KIND people in the world. Thank you.  To their supervisor Ms. Savannah Standish please take care of them."
Feb 2021,10,COVID - Packed Passengers in the back of the plane - not allowed to spread out,I flew on United on 2/16 from Boston to Tampa Bay. The flight was less than 50% full - possibly 35-40% of the economy seats were occupied. United placed ALL economy passengers in the back of the airplane with no spacing between rows. There were 10 rows of empty seats at the front of the economy cabin. I asked to move to an empty row but was told that I had not paid for those seats and therefore had to stay put. It is very clear that United is now prioritizing the extra revenue over the safety of their customers. Shame on them!
Feb 2021,10,They make their own rules,"Be aware that this airline does not follow their own rules or protocols and they make up their own upon arrival at the ticket desk. I am an Australian citizen, going back to Australia for Uni. I got my COVID-19 test within the 72 hours that is required, and took all the necessary steps to prepare as I am well aware that Australia is very strict with incoming international flights right now. Upon arrival at the ticket desk they ran into a problem with Covid test, telling me that it exceeded the 72 hours, which is untrue. They are also spreading misinformation that you need to meet that 72 hour requirement upon arrival into Sydney, AUS, which is untrue and does not align with what the Australian Government says. They also said I should get a rapid test for $500 downtown San Francisco, which Australia does not allow rapid tests unless in extreme dire circumstances as they prefer the regular PCR test. They gave me just about every excuse in the book as to why I could not board my flight. Before my flight they sent me a confirmation email saying that I could get my test no earlier than 2/11/2021, which I had done. I brought up their rules and protocols on their website as well as the official Australian Governments website to show them that they were wrong. They did not read it, and I believe at some point they knew that they were wrong but didn’t want to deny and look like they didn’t know what they were doing, so they started to pull excuses out of their behind. I pleaded with them for 4 hours, and the supervisor Karim kept asking the ticket employees if they booted me off the flight yet. They were rude and did not listen to me. I am an Australian citizen as I mentioned earlier, trust me when I say I know you must follow their rules if you want to enter the country, I had weeks to prepare and I took all the necessary steps to prepare. I even printed off my declaration, as well as all other documents and put them into a folder because I knew upon arrival in AUS they are strict about such things. To end the rant, I did not end up boarding my flight. I spent the night alone at the SFO international airport. I was stuck, and desperate. I spent thousands of dollars on my ticket. I called United’s customer service and they were surprised I was not allowed to board my flight, they tried calling the supervisor but they cannot override him and his authority. So instead they rebooked my ticket for a later time and gave me $600 as compensation. Yes, it was resolved in the end, but I should have been allowed to board in the first place. It is not true that you have to have a 72 hour covid test that aligns with the arrival into Sydney, I mean the flight alone is 14 hours. They make their own rules there, and if you try to prove them wrong with United’s actual rules they will still deny you. They do not like to admit they are wrong. Luckily I will be going to LAX instead of SFO to go to Sydney, I would not trust the people in San Francisco, they are not following the mandated rules, if they don’t like you they will deny you access. I know other Aussies are flying with them right now and I just want to spread awareness so you don’t waste your money. They also mentioned that this happened to another Aussie and they spent $500 and went downtown just to get the rapid test. I don’t know why they weren’t recommending the rapid testing at the airport...I suspect they were trying to drum up business for this rapid testing thing downtown. Be careful when booking with them, they are very untrustworthy and spread misinformation."
Feb 2021,10,Worst flight ever,"When we landed in LAX returning from Honolulu, people were pushing from the back to get off first and when myself and other passengers asked them to sit they refused. My partner and I tried to get up when it was our turn and we were pushed and told I would get my skinny white ass knocked out. The passenger then pushed my partner and got in my face when I got in the middle to keep her off of her. Your flight attendants did nothing to control the situation and had no regards for social distancing. These passengers were on top of everyone and when I asked why she was doing nothing she said “seriously?” I fly with United a lot, either as a civilian or for military purposes and I’ve never experienced anything like this. Not only was this situation physically unsafe but also they had no regards for the covid rules. I’ve never been so disgusted over how little your employees did."
Feb 2021,10,Not professional flight attendants,The flight attendants are rude and not professional. This will be my last flight with United Airlines. I am done.
Feb 2021,10,Business class worst than economy,"Dont know from where to begin, from the remark i got for the air waitress ( thinking she is a ceo ) telling me i got lucky she can get me another dinner cause mine was cold and that they usually don't do that ( i paid almost 4k for a ticket lol ) and continuing to them taking advantage of me when i got stuck in a storm on top of that covid-19 and couldn't budge with me on reservation changes , now don't get me wrong i know most companies are not the best but im telling you united airlines are the worst stay away, i will never fly with them again"

Feb 2021,10,Could barely fit in my seat,"Unless you enjoy placing your elbow over the stranger next to you, being claustrophobic for the entirety of your flight and eating fart breath, I would not recommend. It is so small. Not only is my elbow touching the person next to me, but also my torso and thigh. I’m a 5’2 woman so it’s not like I’m taking up an enormous amount of space. If you are overweight or muscly, don’t."
Feb 2021,10,Unbelievable,"I'm not sure how United will or should stay in business. I will not go into the details, but I will definitely never fly them again.  Trip Advisor I feel it is Asinine to type 200 characters as it really doesn't matter. The fact of the matter is I do not recommend them."
Feb 2021,10,Never again!!!,"My plane trip to Milwaukee from Chicago was canceled at about 5:30pm. Therefore, I requested for my two check-in baggage at the baggage claim around 5:45pm. At 9pm, I asked a United airlines worker to help look for my bags for me, only to find out that I waited 4 hours for Nothing!!! My two (2) check-in bags were put on another plane that just departed without us!!! Now I have to spend the night at the airport with no food, no bed, and no blankets, and it was super cold and uncomfortable! And when I finally do reach the Milwaukee Airport...I can only hope and pray that no one accidentally or intentionally took our 2 baggage full of valuables. I'm pissed off to the Max!!! Had they told me that they accidentally put my luggage on another plane sooner than 4 hours, I would've took the bus home asap and be ready for work the next day. But No! Because of these lazy workers here at United Airlines, me and my girlfriend are are stuck here at the Chicago Airport with Nothing and we can only hope that our luggage will still be at the Milwaukee Airport when we arrive there the next day! NEVER AGAIN!!!"
Feb 2021,10,United had no costumer focus,"United just doesn’t get it ! In world of COVID other airlines are focusing on customer service ! United just keeps shooting themselves in the foot !!!  They waive change fees which is great ; however , if you book a businesss or economy ticket they won’t let you change the ticket for a lower class fare like basic economy . This they make you pay more for a rebooking flight even though basic economy may be available!!!  Racket to make more money with no customer focus !!!  It’s a shame they just can’t get their act together like delta and sw airlines !!!!  Oh well at least they are consistent !"
Feb 2021,10,I will never travel with this airline nor will I recommend it to anyone!,"UNITED Airlines ruined my Valentine's Day. I planned a surprise for my fiance, who lives in Mexico, but United Airlines did not allow me to board in. They alleged that I needed a visa to travel to Mexico, but I am a green card holder. My card expired and I have an extension of my green card, which they did not accept. The extension stamp on my passport states that it is evidence of my lawful status as a resident of the USA. Their travel assistance staff members are slow, make conclusions without basis, are rude and condescending. My flight was at 3:35PM and I came to the airport 3 hours before, but it was in vain. Some supervisors tried to assist me (they were nice), but left after they took pictures of all my documents and sent them to someone in Mexico for clearance. They left, never came back, and i missed my flight. One of the representatives, Wayne Reynolds, informed that i would get a credit, instead of a refund. I told them I am a law student and work as a paralegal at an Immigration law firm and that I have traveled 4 times to Mexico using that extension, and I never had an issue with any other airlines nor with Mexico officials at their port of entry. I paid $200 for transportation + the flight ticket. I was unable to surprise my fiance on Valentine's Day because of United Airlines and they lack of knowledge, experience, customer service, willingness to assist clients. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED! I WILL NEVER TRAVEL WITH THIS AIRLINE, NOR WILL I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE"
Feb 2021,20,Worst experience,"Flight was delayed until the next morning and the airline made no effort to arrange anything else. Then when they arranged my hotel they picked one that did not have a shuttle but neglected to provide any other method of transportation and told me incorrectly that there was a shuttle. I spent about an hour trying to set up a taxi voucher, only to find out in the taxi that it was not enough money so I had to pay the difference. In the end it took me over 2 hours to figure out a hotel and get there. In the morning I requested reimbursement for this but they conveniently did not have the right form and told me I would have to request this on my own online. THEN my flight that morning continued to get delayed. Not even due to the weather, but because the TOILET WATER was frozen. Not sure why they couldn't put us on another plane since all other planes were able to leave, including one to Cancun. Why does the Cancun flight get to leave on time and not us?? So ended up being delayed over 2 hours when I was supposed to be home LAST NIGHT. All of the staff were nice but couldn't seem to get anything right. I would be less mad if the delays today were actually due to weather, not things that were in their control. No other planes had frozen toilet water. I also would be less mad if it hadn't taken at least 6 employees and a lot of walking to help me figure out a hotel last night. I think at this point I deserve a free flight for all of the inconveniences and stress."
Feb 2021,10,United Blatantly Lied,"Flight delayed from MSP to DEN by one hour. Told by multiple gate agents and staff that it was due to severe weather in Denver. I researched the weather and the departure/arrival situation in Denver. Very few other flights were delayed and the weather was fine. We tried to change our connecting flight but were reassured that our connection would get delayed too because of the bad weather. I informed the gate agent that I didn’t think that was the case. We kept getting passed off to other employees and no one helped solve our problem. Essentially they said we could figure it out in Denver. When we finally board, the pilot states the flight was not delayed due to weather but rather due to staffing shortages. We were lied to all morning and no one helped us change our flight under the pretenses that it was the weather. I am extremely disappointed in the service and most upset about the lies. We landed in Denver to sunny weather and light winds. We missed our connection."
Feb 2021,10,"What a nightmare, never again","The pilot delayed the flight an hour giving people with delayed flights a chance to make the flight. We eventually took off and nearly got to Eagle but had to go back to Denver because of bad visibility. They then said the weather would improve in 90 minutes and we'd reboard. 5 minutes later they canceled the flight and sent the crew to the next gate to work a different flight. All flights to Vail were full so it would be at least 24 hours before leaving Denver. There weren't any hotels nearby with availability so got to spend a horrible night in the airport, unable to get any sleep and trying to avoid homeless people trying to keep warm in the airport. Had to find my own transportation to Vail even though I paid more than 2× the Denver fare for the convenience of flying to Vail Eagle. I'll never do this again. If I had gotten the cheaper fare and taken a shuttle that day, I would have gotten a good night's sleep, saved money and been able to ski. I regret coming on this trip and am tempted to cut my losses and go straight home. My chances of getting sick are exponentially worse because of my 18 hours in the Denver airport."
Feb 2021,10,"Do NOT Fly United, You Are Wasting Your Money!","I fly on United twice and they are just horrible. Customer service is awful. Both time, it was United's fault and they did nothing about it. They just wanted to charge me extra money. They did not want to refund my money. Talking to customer service is draining and exhausting. Please save your money and time. They simply not worth your energy!"
Feb 2021,50,Over all...No complaints,"After I booked United, I read so many bad reviews I was pretty scared something would happen, but...no complaints. Planes were on time. Staff wasnt exactly friendly, but not unfriendly either. They did their jobs. Snacks bags were provided. They boarded from the back of the plane first and deboarded several rows at at a time. I wasnt expecting a fancy private jet...I just wanted to get to destination and back home with no issues and it happened. Worth every penny."
Feb 2021,10,Avoid it at all cost never again,Family of 9 checked in United premier security check in Chicago ohare From beginning Rude and unpleasant without any people skills security check ladies ruin my coat .Asked for manager that even worst without any help or guidance rude without any knowledge person.All this screaming and yelling at us made our kids cry.I rather go thru regular security just to avoid this premier Rude service.Never again!!!
Feb 2021,30,Hearing about mask usage over and over was a little annoying,"the flights were on time and good with one stop only. I'm not a big dust mask fan for virus protection. I find a lot of hypocrisy in the whole thing. Like wear a mask but were all crammed in a airplane together with no social distancing so what's the point of beating a dead horse about a mask and making sure its over your nose and how if you don't wear it they will never let you fly with them again, its a little bit like your being threatened to wear it in a way. I had the thought that if one of the airline providers where offering no mask required freedom of choice flights I would fly with that airline with preference and even pay more for the freedom of choice."
Feb 2021,20,Damaged luggage,"The flight was okay, a 30 minute flight. But why do I pick up my baggage like this? And they told me they don’t handle this kind of damage no more. PLEASE IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR STUFF, use another airline because they obviously don’t!"
Feb 2021,10,Terrible Service,"Their plane had an engine issue on takeoff and United canceled my flight because the delays made me miss my connection. I contacted Reservations and the most they could offer was a refund. I had no choice but to buy a last-minute $700 ticket when I originally paid $300 to make it home for a family matter. They did not reimburse me and made me waste a travel day for an issue on THEIR end. Because of this huge waste of money due to issues with their plane and service, I would not consider flying with them again!"
Feb 2021,50,Great customer service. Highly recommend,"I flew from Detroit to Vegas with friends. They booked through Expedia, but I booked direct through United. Somehow.....I ended up booking a different connecting flight then they did. My layover in Denver was scheduled to be 3 hours and theirs only 1 hour. I went to customer service and they were able to get me on stand by on my friends flight.    Great customer service....it was very much appreciated!"
Feb 2021,30,Shi.tty “Wifi”,"Here’s an idea: maybe have Wifi that actually works, or I’ll smack you harder than you smacked that doctor!"
Feb 2021,10,Crappy company and service,"Really bad service. Dirty, uncomfortable seats. Not worth the price of a ticket. Company needs to shut down immediately. Nuff said."
Feb 2021,50,Great Customer Service,"My girlfriend and I just returned from a vacation and as Canadians, there has been a lot of added stress returning to Canada at the moment. During our vacation, we were told that our flight had been changed and now required us to do an overnight layover in Houston and a second layover in Washington DC. Our flights were booked through United, but this particular flight that had been cancelled was supposed to be operated by Air Canada.    Rosy Gonzales of the Houston airport took the time to understand our situation and she was a huge help in getting us a room for the night at a hotel nearby. This was the best service we have ever received from any airline employee ever and we travel a lot.    After our reservation was booked, she even called the hotel to get them to send their shuttle for us.    Over the top service from an amazing employee, she deserves a raise!    I wouldn't normally write a review like this, but she deserves a huge thank you from us.  Thank you again Rosy!"
Feb 2021,10,Never Again,"Consistently late departures/arrivals, we had to run through Chicago airport both ways to catch our connecting flights, they had to power down plane and “reboot” in Duluth (captain said this isn’t uncommon in cold weather, but it seemingly wasn’t addressed proactively, so we boarded late), paid for preferred seats but didn’t get them, baggage check worker in Denver shook her tip jar at me after we checked our bags (tacky, I was going to tip anyway), rude female flight attendant from Chicago to Duluth, MN on 2/8 (our other UA flights had friendly and helpful flight attendants) and our bags didn’t make it on our flight home. I never seem to have a positive experience with this airline. It seems more often than not they are late and/or the luggage doesn’t make it. I wanted to give them one last shot because they fly out of Duluth, but I’m pretty sure we will never fly UA again, unfortunately."
Feb 2021,50,Another great United experience,"Caring flight attendants, Covid 19 precautions, and on time performance again. We were very happy with our trip."
Feb 2021,10,No effort to make travel safe,I flew out to Seattle from Baltimore on Alaska Airlines. Everyone was spread out during boarding and on the plane and the whole process was smooth and safe.  Our return was on United from Seattle to Chicago then Baltimore. The flight to Chicago was fully booked with every single seat taken. You can imagine how crowded it was. Our take off was aborted for a technical problem which added an additional 90 minutes .. the flight to baltimore was half empty but everyone was crammed into the back of the flight since they reserved the front half for “economy plus” to charge people more rather than use the space to spread people apart.  I will not be using United again.
Feb 2021,50,10/10,"My flight was UA960 to Frankfurt.  I have a severe anxiety disorder that causes physical symptoms. I stupidly left my medication at my origin flight base and twenty minutes into my flight I started to panic. The staff on this flight... wow.. I can’t even say enough wonderful things. They were so amazing, and Georgina was the motherly figure I desperately needed to make it through. Thank you so much to everyone on that flight. I will never ever forget your kindness, and your willingness to help someone, and comfort someone you didn’t even know. From the oxygen tank, to the staff administered medication, to walking me to my gate, and helping me find my father..... thank you thank you thank you."
Feb 2021,10,They scammed us.,"THEY SCAMMED US!!! Did extensive research before I booked a flight. I wanted to make sure I could get a refund or full credit for a future travel. United stated that they don’t do change fees for flights and they give full credit. So I booked for tulum. Spent $318 each & bought two tickets. Cancelled my trip and booked a new trip to Austin & Denver. When I went to change my flight, it doesn’t tell you how much credit you’re using. It just says “+$0 extra.” I even searched how much my flight would of been if I didn’t use credit. Total would be $168. When i went back to book another flight (because I had an extra $150 left, it says I have nothing left. Called twice and both workers said my ticket value was reduced to $238. But even so, the tickets I bought were only $168. So I should have some credit left. Bottom line: their system is all messed up and trying to cheat customers. Because I did the same thing for both tickets and they came out different. One ticket said I had credit left but the other said I didn’t. None of the prices added up. Stay away from united."
Feb 2021,10,No help,"In July 2020 my wife and I had bought 4 tickets to Tokyo from San Francisco. Due to the pandemic and both of us in health care, we cannot do any travel outside of the United States. When we called United for assistance they told us there was nothing they could do for us and would send us to TravelGuard (the company we bought our flight insurance from), as she transferred our call she also canceled our tickets, $4,000 worth which is not refundable. We didn't know she would just cancel our tickets before we could even see if we had a case, now we are stuck in limbo with the insurance company which seems may not go anywhere either, since there is no relief for a pandemic. I would stay clear of this company."
Feb 2021,10,MISLEADING RIPOFF,"Take another airline. They don’t tell you that AFTER you purchase your ticket, then you have to pay for a seat, pay for luggage-EVEN CARRY ONs. Only 1 bag on plane IF YOU PAY FOR  IT and IF IT DOESNT HAVE WHEELS. wth?? They tell you to arrive AT LEAST 2 hours early which we did so we could check in and relax, maybe get some coffee or a bite to eat not noooooo. the ticket agency didn’t Open till 30 min after we got here. All the kiosks were down WITH NO SIGNAGE that they don’t open until 330am so you can’t check in early. Then the security doesn’t open till 4 with nowhere to sit. We finally get checked etc looking forward to some food and coffee but noooooo. No food or coffee opens until 430. NOBODY will do anything until exactly the second the hand hits the time. Good lord this is the most ridiculous, exploitive thing. People were wandering around the check in area all confused and irritated. I will never fly United again. Horrible. Why offer flights before anything opens?? They’re just too cheap to have staff stay open to help paying customers yet the price of tickets goes up and the amenities continue to go down."
Feb 2021,50,"Smooth, problem free flight","I didn't know what to expect with all the Covid-19 business, but everything was done in an orderly fashion keeping as much distance as possible between boarders. The plane had been cleaned and all were given wipes to do their own cleaning if desired. The crew was friendly, the service and food good, as always. The arrival in Quito with our negative test results was also a non-event, and we were quickly on our way."
Feb 2021,10,STAY AWAY! i warned you,"Just sharing my experience for anyone interested in flying with United  Flew into Mex City with my family with a transfer flight needed to go to another city. After repeated calls to United BEFORE MY FLIGHT letting them know that 30mins is not enough time to go through Customs, Security, and Covid procedures, MULTIPLE United reps assured me that it was plenty of time.    Of course, we missed our flight and we were stranded in a city where we dont speak the language. Cost us $563 in hotel, cab fare, and lost Air bnb $.  Submitted claim to ""Customer Care"", takes them 14 business days to even respond and when they do they said ""we care"" and ""we understand"" but in the end, and a month later with delayed responses UNITED has become nothing but a disappointment and burden to myself and my family, caused serious stress and anxiety to my family that should have been avoided.    Expected much more and received so much less than I thought, STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE, I warn you"
Feb 2021,10,Denied refund for a flight THEY cancelled,"United Airlines is the WORST airline ever. I had a trip back to my home last July and they delayed it for a day, then canceled it altogether. I found out they canceled it the night before I was supposed to fly, so I called for a refund and the lady said I would get it back to my credit card in 7-10 days. But you know what? It has been 7 MONTHS and still nothing. I've filled out the form, repeatedly emailed to no response. I called them two more times after that and the first time they said they transferred my request to HK quarters and wait for an email to be sent to me, and the second time they said they denied my refund and check my email for the reason. There was NO email whatsoever. The worst thing? My friend was on the same flight as me and she got her refund months ago. The only difference is she has a green card and I don't. They're literally robbing and scamming people. What kind of airline denies a refund to a flight THEY canceled?"
Feb 2021,10,Incompetent and not Helpful,"1:00 pm Flight from Sacramento International airport (SMF) to Houston Bush airport February 2nd. This was a connection flight for Turkish Airlines to Istanbul then to Jordan. lost my flight because of incompetent personnel at the counter. had a covid 19 PCR test with the negative result which was taken within the last 72 hours as Jordan requires it. I was at the airport 2.5 hours before the flight, they could not interpret the required rules for covid 19 even their supervisor was just as bad and they did not help at all. very sad and bad experience a total loss."
Feb 2021,10,They suck,"They showed tickets that weren't available. So I bought the next cheapest ticket. Added a bag to go under the plane. Then I had to pay for seating to make sure that my 3 yr old grandson sat next to his mom. Then the flight was canceled due to air traffic control. They had to get a motel. So I sent my daughter some money so they can eat. But she had to pay for the baggage under the plane, that I already paid for. And so because they changed her flight, me paying for the seating didn't apply anymore. The only reason he got to sit next to his mom, was because a lady gave up her seat. I will never go through United airlines ever again. I gave a 1 rating because I couldn't give a 0. United airlines suck."
Feb 2021,10,DO NOT SPEND A PENNY WITH THESE PEOPLE!,Homophobic and racist! Will never spend another dollar with United Airlines! Would give Zero stars if I could! No covid precautions were taken on the plane. Money over Safety is pretty much what one flight attendant said. Do NOT EVER RECOMMEND TO ANYBODY!
Feb 2021,10,Non existent Customer Service,Horrible!!! Customer service is non existent. Clerk at check in window very rude and unhelpful... Especially because I interrupted her very inappropriate conversation she was having with co-worker. Called the airline before hand about carry on. Person on the phone assured me carry on was included even after giving reservation information and advising I booked via Expedia....surprise surprise got hit with an extra $70.00 fee for 2 tiny carry on bags. Never again!!
Feb 2021,20,Still Horrible Customer Service Post Covid Pandemic,I was hoping that their customer Service would improve following the tremendous losses they had with the Pandemic BUT NO! They were as bad especially the Flight Attendant service.  During this long flight the Flight attendant were busy doing their online shopping DID not come out of their holes ONLY twice during serving the meals!  Totally unfriendly.
Jan 2021,10,Terrible Customer Service,The story is way too long to post but long story short I rebooked with them for an earlier flight and requested a refund on the flight they rescheduled due to their flight cancellation. They would not refund the flight because they said it was within the two hour window policy. I will pay more to fly with a different airline. One of the most unethical airline experiences I have ever had.
Jan 2021,10,Free for them to change your flights-anytime any where for you - AGH,Worst experience ever. Booked two leg flights to and from Reno. First they changed times and added legs to our flights. On the way back less than 24 hour notice..Then our last flight of three way back was cancelled. Sometimes can’t prevent everything but then last min they delayed out flight after we arrived the next day for it when they should have known way earlier that morning. Over night checking in and out of airport a pain enough.. We were almost the only people in the airport terminal for the flight so I have no idea how we can be the only ones not notified since we checked in on time with it on time. Then mixed messages the whole time. They did give us some flight credits after hours of our time on the phone through their crappy computer system and finally getting someone competent for some help. Never again- they can just do what they want without anything you can do about it. Wish I could run a company charging for one thing and just offering whatever we want- garbage.
Jan 2021,10,Horrible customer service and employees who don't listen,"Trust, honesty and integrity are huge values to me and determine who I continue to do buisness with. When I am told something by a company or a representative of a company, then I expect them to honor their word or at least acknowledge when they have lied to me. Recently, my wife and I booked a trip with United and were offered a Chase credit card to gain perks including free baggage. We were approved for the card and used it to book our flights, but our reservation did not show we would be receiving our perks. After calling United and Chase multiple times, including the week before our departure, we were assured that we should receive free checked bags and carry-ons bags for our flight. We were told that at worse, we would simply be charged and then could request a reimbursement after the fact (a bit more work on our end, but at least we could receive what was promised).    At the airport the day of our flight however, we were told by the United representative that not only would we be charged for all our bags, but that we also were not even allowed to have carry-ons and we would have to pay to have them checked instead. My wife and I packed our fragile items inside our carry-ons expecting to have them with us in the airplane and were not prepared to have them taken from us. I asked to speak to the manager and was told that the gentleman I was speaking with was indeed the lead agent and there was nobody higher than him I could speak with. He refused to listen – he literally would not let me finish my explanation – multiple times and was extremely rude. He gave me no other choice, but to check my bags. Since at that point we did not have time to keep fighting at the risk of missing our flight, I finally paid the man. He told me that if I had any further concerns I could take them up with a gal once I reached the gate.    Fortunately, the man at the gate would listen to me and refunded us. Unfortunately, it was already too late since they took our fragile bags. Upon arrival, my fears were realized and some of my contents were damaged. United customer services have been awful to deal with. You can’t call anyone to explain over the phone and you have a very limited number characters in which to describe your issue on their website. After filling this out, a representative reached out via email and claimed that their agent at the front desk had previously reached out and verbally apologized to me and they said I needed to contact a different department for damaged goods. After exchanging multiple emails and clarifying that they had the wrong information and that I had never been reached out to, they continued to claim that I did. Again, their representatives do NOT listen to their customers – even when it is written down. It has been a week now, and their customer service team has still yet to respond to my last email sampling stating that what they are saying is not true.    I do not enjoy doing business with a company who does not listen to their customers and who make it very difficult to report issues within their company. If a company wants my business (and I would think others would agree) then they need listen to feedback and value the longevity of my commitment to them. Needless to say, I plan on avoiding United as much as possible since they can’t seem to resolve issues when they arise."
Jan 2021,10,Terrible Airline,Definitely the worst airline I’ve flown. They put the wrong flight time on my itinerary TWICE and so I get to the airport five and half hours before my flight. The staff were also very rude and were not helpful while trying to figure everything out.
Jan 2021,10,If I could leave zero stars I would.,"Hands down the absolute worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. I’ve gotten better service at the DMV. YOU CAN GET AHOLD OF THE IRS EASIER THAN THESE FOOLS. The “customer service” representatives told me I couldn’t upgrade my ticket even though their own website clearly says you can and in fact even prompts you to upgrade. Got hung up on 3 times by a lady named Angel who claimed she had a bad connection, the second time prior to being hung up on by Angel she placed me on a 35 minute hold. That was fun. I would ride my bike to Hawaii covered in shark bait before I will ever fly United again. I can absolutely see why they have to continue layoffs. Maybe, just maybe, if you have to limit your employees due to the economy you should keep the ones that can count to 20 with their shoes on."
Jan 2021,10,Airline,"The worst experience in my life. I had a seat but when I came to airplane to check my seat - it was taken! Then it was a big line waiting for solving my problem! So irresponsible! The people are rude. Some people have privilege, if they want it - they take others place and at the end you are apologizing that someone took your place. It was not my false that they changed it. The thing is they didn’t let me know about it! I will never ever fly on this airline! Do not recommend!"
Jan 2021,20,Not worth money for First Class,"Flew First Class from Denver to Chicago on United. It was not worth the price. The seat was uncomfortable. The snack was awful. I was served with cream cheese ciabatta which was tasteless. In flight entertainment was outdated (old programs and shows). Extra charge for wifi (for what I paid for the first class ticket, it should be free). It was not worth extra money spent to be on First Class."
Jan 2021,30,Disappointed,We decided to pay extra for First Class tickets on United for our trip from Chicago to Hawaii. I read some raving review about how wonderful the experience would be. It was a big disappointment. It was not what I expected. The lay flat seat was a plus. 9 hrs flight was not too painful when you can lay down and sleep. Sorry to say that was the only good thing. First disappointment - asked for a mimosa - we do not have champagne on this flight was the answer; got a can of sparkling water instead. Disappointment #2 - inflight entertainment - no live TV even when flight info on the website said there would be for premium class. Disappointment # 3 - inflight movies and shows are outdated. Disappointment #4 - 9 hrs flight - only one meal served. Got 3 little pancakes with 2 sausages and unknown sweet cream for breaksfast. They do have some snack(chips and gummy bears) in the galley during the flight. Just need to get them yourself. Disappointment #5 - extra charge for wifi. Read some review - they were served with warm nuts and sparking wine before take off. Warm cookies and ice cream before landing. I did not get to experience any of that on my flight. I got a small meal and a bag of chip with sparkling water on my flight. So disappointed. Not worth the money spent.
Jan 2021,10,Bottom of the List,"Booked a round trip first class ticket using a previous flight credit. Not only does United pocket the difference in the flight credit & the price of the ticket, they disguise it by upping the ticket price in the billing details. In addition, they applied an additional $9 charge for a ""preferred seat"" on one leg that was mixed cabin. There is a good reason they again rate close to the bottom of all US airlines. This is a last resort airline."
Jan 2021,50,Great Flight Thank you,"My flight was smooth and the staff was A one! Incredibly kind, and helpful. I will definitely fly united again. Thank you ."
Jan 2021,10,Can't get a refund,"We were going to visit our daughter in May, 2020 and then pandemic hit. Airline changed my flight form non-stop to 1-stop. Boston and Philadelphia were shuttering due to pandemic. Only airline in US that would no allow refund due to pandemic. was given a certificate instead which I did not want. Still have no place to fly to and wife and I rarely fly to begin with. UA will still not refund. My daughter told me not to fly United Airlines because of her bad experiences but it had the only direct flights. I should have listened to her. I hope they have good use for my $700."
Jan 2021,10,"Lousy service, poor value for money","Flying business class (they even dare to call it “First”) with a connecting flight on another Star Alliance airline and United does not even provide lounge access. Poor value for money, rude staff, lousy service."
Jan 2021,10,Bag issue,It didn’t make any sense how I went to the airport to check in then they told me that I have to pay for my luggage. They didn’t mention anything online when I was booking my flight and they also said I couldn’t do a carry on because I booked as a “basic” the lady at the front was so rude she said I booked as a basic therefore I have to check in my car and they charged me a fee. I usually don’t mind paying if I have to pay to check in a bag or carry on but the thing that pissed me off the most is nothing was mentioned online and when I went to check in they going tell me that I have to pay for my bag and check it in or I can’t fly with them. Very unprofessional and unorganized!!
Jan 2021,10,Canceled due to covid,Credit for less than one year. Would never been able to travel. Plan was to go in April. Given Credit until January. Seriously messed up.
Jan 2021,10,Report,This is my first time traveling by plane and I can say I had one of the worst experiences and I do not recommend it to anyone.i had problem whith check in guy his is want tek my staf
Jan 2021,10,Poor reshuffling of seats that only make the trip worse.,"I had a seat at front of plane, they changed me to the back of the plane to “help with social distancing”. Of course they sat me right next to a stranger in the back of the plane. Nice job United I hate flying with you it’s always something that makes the trip worse for me. And they will never accommodate no matter how politely I ask."
Jan 2021,10,"Terrible....3 hour delay, plane departs-1 hour in air, then returns for maintenance....no communications form pilot/crew",Terrible experience...continues 20 hours later  3 hour delay Sunday....planet departs 1 hour in air returns to airport for maintenance  Pilot/crew provide no communications  Rebook for MONDAY 9AM....return and held up at security for 15 minutes because UA has NOT informed security that same boarding passes....now waiting for maintenance and no one knows status......clearly UA sucks
Jan 2021,10,Awful,"It was too hot, half of my seat was stolen by fat ass. Why the hell others problems becomes mine? The staff on a plane nice."
Jan 2021,10,Ripoff Company!,"This airlines says it will hold your flight credits to use towards a future flight up to 12 months from original date of purchase. But what they neglect to tell you is that if you use those flight credits for a less expensive flight, you have forfeited any additional flight funds from there on out. So if you book a $400 flight originally, then cancel it and rebook a different flight for $200...they just keep the other $200 and you can no longer use it!"
Jan 2021,50,Gate attendant. At D2,Jake was so friendly and helpful. Haven’t seen that kind of friendliness in some time and I travel a lot
Jan 2021,20,The friendly skies are no more!!,"It’s painfully obvious that these steward and stewardess do not care. They barked at people the whole trip, ran the drink cart down the isle like they just don’t care, they were short with their responses. The plane was great, it was clean, the pilot landed perfectly but the customer service is poor. Now fly Southwest and you will have a great customer experience. Boarding on Southwest is different but for the most part people are friendly."
Jan 2021,10,Denied Use Of Flight Credits,"Tried using over $3,000 in credits for previously cancelled flights and were not allowed to use them as one segment of a 5 leg trip on United included one short hop with one of their partners!! This despite the fact I was attempting to book direct on United with 4 of the segments on United in business class!!! What a scam!!! My future flying plans will definitely avoid this airline and its partners!!"
Jan 2021,20,Second rate airline with no social distance,"Took a flight with United because it was the only airline flying into a smaller airport. The whole airline from check in to boarding flight felt second rate and not meeting my expectations.    Seats were not blocked to create social distance and was forced to share a first class row during the pandemic, which obvious or any allow for any distance. I will not fly with them again and will stick to flying with Delta airlines as much as possible."
Jan 2021,20,Economy is intentionally and unnecessarily a pain,"If you fly basic economy be prepared for extra lines at the airport, as United does not allow you to check in online."
Jan 2021,10,I am a pilot and I won't fly United any longer,"I no longer consider United safe enough to allow my family to fly on a United plane. Maintenance is EVERYTHING in the airline business.  In my opinion Southwest is the best run, and the safest airline in the country. I won't get on a United plane again."
Jan 2021,20,Employees in Denver Airport not wearing masks properly,"I've was in Denver International Airport twice in December 2020. Several employees were not properly wearing their masks. I took photos and sent them to United's customer service department, but they did not seem too concerned."
Jan 2021,40,United - Hyderabad to Boston Business Class Experience!!,"I traveled from Hyderabad to Boston in August 2020 and it was in the middle of the COVID pandemic. United followed all the safety protocols and it was ver reassuring to see them taking the safety of their passengers seriously.    The airline amenities was comfortable as I was in their Polaris cabin. However, the food was not all that great but that is understandable in the middle of the pandemic. I appreciate United making efforts to ensure my flight was comfortable and enjoyable.    I would recommend United to anyone out there reading this post."
Jan 2021,10,"Lost bag, return 5 days later in complete tatters, with all clothes and items inside ripped and broken","My bag was lost upon arrival in Guadalajara and all of the labour (calling, filing forms, calling again - every day, filing more forms) was done by myself with United employees doing nothing to ease the process. When my bags finally were found, they were in complete tatters, with all my clothing inside ripped and belongings smashed. It looks as though it was dragged for a mile or stuck in a belt. There was no explanation or apology and i then spent over 4 hours filing forms for all of my belongings. This is outrageous and I feel very abused. Not only should I have immediately received compensation money without question - I should not have to provide receipts for my belongings in order to get compensation. Let's be honest, who carries their receipts for their clothing etc. with them while their travel - or at all?! I would not recommend this airline under any circumstances."
Jan 2021,10,"Horrible time, horrible compensation","United delayed us for nearly 9 hours on a one-hour flight due to a technical issue they had on their plane. Most of the hours were spent inside the plane, which is annoying for a 6’2” guy and is more than annoying during a pandemic. I reached out to United customer support and for the nearly nine hours of delay, they gave me thirty five dollars worth of miles. That means United values my time, lack of comfort, and lack of safety at roughly four dollars worth of miles per hour. Wow!"
Jan 2021,10,Overbooking and unfair refund policy.,"Here is a recent email i sent to the customer care department after having had a very poor conversation about my refund. They were extremely rude and forced me to accept my unfair compensation because there is currently no guideline holding them accountable for “overbooking”, so they abuse whoever, whenever. Point is: if you involuntary downgraded me from first class to economy even if it was during half way through the flight, you at least can apologize by refunding me for the entire flight. And I don’t want certificates, i want my full refund, because I was inconvenienced. See below:    Dear X,    My experience talking to you today has unfortunately left me with a very poor impression of the customer care team at United Airlines. First and most importantly, you failed to answer why my ticket, that I rightfully bought and reserved, with no insurance (so there was no chance of canceling on my end), was involuntary downgraded. Clearly United failed to provide a reasonable answer and this leads me to think it is a clear consumer/passenger abuse, JUST because the airlines can do so, given their small yet powerful concentration of market power. It was clearly incentivized due to making that extra margin from my seat having been sold to someone willing to pay more. What will remain with me is your reply to saying “we cannot answer you as to why we overbooked”. Policies as they are remain because of the failure of the DOJ to look into these matters as abuses. While I was forced to accept the unfair refund amount today, I will make sure that if there are class actions and lawsuits arising in the near future with matters relevant to refunds related to overbooking at United, I will be the first to join. Needless to say I will work on investigating this matter moving forward. Goodluck."
Jan 2021,20,No Mask Boarded,"My first flight since March. Was feeling relatively safe until our gate agent allowed a passenger to 1) sit in the gate area without a mask, 2) ask a question at the desk without a mask and 3) BOARD the plane without a mask. The flight attendants did make him put it on and were good about reminding people to keep their masks on during the flight but come on! This is NOT good enough, United. If you want us to believe your film about how safe the aircraft is, this basic basic thing cannot happen."
Jan 2021,50,Recommend,"Great service, friendly staff. Antonio, Caleb, and Xhail were very helpful when we missed our flight."
Jan 2021,50,Customer Service Rep,Alex with customer service was AMAZING!! Hope if you need any customer service you are lucky enough to have her answer!!
Jan 2021,10,Useless airline,"United airlines consistently lowers the bar each time with their useless performance, arrogant crew and disgusting service. The crew have no idea that they're employed in the hospitality sector and have no idea about the virtues of politeness, courtesy and being pleasant towards the passengers.    Food. I opted for the non veg meal which had a smelly piece of fish, ""salad"" which comprised of whole tomatoes, few slices of cucumber and rotting lettuce leaves. The only good thing worth having was the cookie at the end of the meal. When I asked for another one, the cabin attendant brought me one but told me it's from his tray. Ouch. What standards and what hospitality    Absolutely avoidable airline. Even the seats are cramped    Btw the above is a review of the business class, their so called Polaris class"
Jan 2021,10,Bad service,"Based on the policy of UA. You are allowed to carry TV. They measure size and weight and if it is within the limit, you either pay oversized or overweight or you just pay one of them. (200$) for each.  Which is ridiculous for flying for 2 hrs.  Some international flights, you pay 75$ to 160$ max and that is for handling. Nothing else  Any way based on the policy we took a tv 65 inch (with in the limit ) they refused to take us in sadly  We had to reschedule our flight for next day and we downgrade it to 55” it was in the limit again and even <50lb. They refused us.  I had talked to 2 customer service people prior and they both said I can and they still managed to refuse us.    We had evidence of the conversation with customer service and they took a lot and said ok. We paid 200$ for oversized (they add Length, width, height)    So for the people that check us in. They really need to educate themselves on their own policy  My advice make sure you read their policy and talk to customer service ahead of time and gather info and evidence before approaching the not so informed people at the desk.    I won’t recommend their flight."
Jan 2021,10,Disaster! Stay away!,"I was excited to take this flight as I read a lot about new business class on United. Guess what - I never did. Their terminal at Newark is a total disaster and nobody knows a thing. Several United employees directed me towards different check-in spots. The one that was supposedly for business class the line was not moving at all. When I started feeling nervous they suggested I go 1 level down to see if there were fewer people there. Nobody really cared that there was not that much left before check-in cut-off. I went down - same situation. Long lines and no help. Went up again and it was almost 1 hour left before my flight departure. Tried to talk to a live person there - she was telling me I had to observe the line. I come back to her again and she tells me it is 1 minute less than an hour before my flight meaning that I missed it. I could see she could not care less but rather took a special pleasure in turning me down. No supervisors, no real help. Just totally ignorant people who can't care less. I am sure their management is the same because if they cared they would check TA and see that there are almost as many ""terrible"" reviews as there are ""excellent"" ones and this is not how it goes in companies who are service oriented. Obviously not this one."
Jan 2021,10,Flight attendant caused a scene because I moved to the seat behind me because the person next to me did not have a mask,"The man next to me was eating McDonald's and did not have a mask on. I noticed the row behind me was empty so I moved, the flight attendant got on the loud speaker and yelled at me and told me to move back. Then she walked down the isle and said move back, I said the man next to me does not have a mask on and he is eating it is not fair to my safety She said move back. I said I am not sitting next to someone without a mask. She said then move up next to another person which decides to eat mid flight. This is a 45 minute flight people should not be eating. With empty seats on the plane the flight attendant should care about customers safety. I didn't cause a scene because I wanted to make it home. This flight attendant should not work there. She never spoke to the man without a mask. This has always been my preferred airline but the customer service just said a general sorry. No real worry."
Jan 2021,20,hit or miss,"The flight left later than scheduled, which is typical of the last 4 United flights that Ive flown in the last 6 months. (Im a traveling nurse and I fly twice/month on average) Although they are loading passengers from the back to the front to decrease exposures, they are overloading the flights and then begging people to switch off of the overbooked flights last minute. Lastly the customer service is horrendous, if you have a complaint or concern it is diminished until you are so frustrated explaining yourself that you forget. I guess I have been spoiled by Southwest Airlines' AMAZING customer service team. If you get a really cheap flight, go for it but beware that youre getting what you pay for. If the flight is average or overpriced, youre better off going with another airline with overall better customer service."
Jan 2021,20,"Rip off on ""No change fees""",Booked a flight with no change fees a few months back. Went to rebook and United won't refund the difference in ticket prices nor offer upgrade.    So what's the point of no change fees if you're not going to honor ticket price differences or offer an upgrade so I can get the value from what I spent on the tickets??    Just another gouge by another big company.
Jan 2021,20,lack of covid protocol,"Flew with my family on 6 Jan 2021 from PUJ to ORD. Two men from Eastern Europe sat behind us and would not keep their masks on. I asked them - three times - to do so and was met with rude hand gestures. The fight attendants? They ignored it. Served them snacks and drinks and would not address it. And the four off duty fight attendants sitting in the same row and in front of them? They ignored it, too. Glad to know that United Airlines cares so much."
Jan 2021,50,MileagePlus a real rewards program,"We accumulate mileage plus rewards on our credit card. We are not on any fancy program just the stock program. United and the star alliance partners allow you to get anywhere in the world with a surprising amount of choice. Better still your miles cover your flight and your out of pocket charge is typically very little never more than $90/pax. Same trip on OneWorld alliance required same points yet $750/pax.  There are no frills in economy but all staff were very helpful, both United and Lufthansa. On our three leg international trip we asked if there was an earlier flight as we had a long layover... no problem the agent searched and offered us a different routing shortening our travel time all at no cost! I actually feel like I am a valued customer to United even as a rewards user. Thank you United and Lufthansa staff and customer support!"
Jan 2021,10,Louis Vuitton bag disrespect,"Never ever fly United airlines. They do not respect your property. I had a Louis Vuitton Keepall bag I had to check in because I had a bottle of Creed Aventus in it and when I got my bag in San Francisco, flew from New Orleans, the handles were ripped. They apparently just grab and toss bags around like it trash bags going into a dumpster.  When I sent the bag in to them, they want to offer me a bag cost 110 dollars that looks nothing like my bag....  Total disrespect. I will never fly United Airlines again and will at every chance share my story. Worst airline EVER !"
Jan 2021,40,Year end trip,Very short but pleasant trip. I've been with United for many years. The airline's safety measurement against covid is good.
Jan 2021,40,Smooth and friendly,"I booked this flight and the return flight in September. My only complaint is that there were changes made to the flight times twice and I did not get an alert. I selected seats for myself and my children. When the flight times changed I was unable to reselect seats on the app without an additional charge. However, both phone calls to correct this were quick and the customer service was exceptional. I ended up with better seats as a result of the phone calls. The flights themselves were good. Flights were on time and smooth. We changed plans once each way in Denver. Both planes to and from Denver were very small with no WiFi offered. The larger planes between Atlanta and Denver had WiFi. I was prepared either way and had downloaded movies from Netflix and Disney to occupy my 7 year old. Attendants were friendly on all 4 planes. Social distancing was inconsistent on all 4 flights but the attendants were often heard reminding people to cover their mouth and nose.    I read a lot of negative reviews about United and was Leary at first, but I would use United again. If you are expecting luxury, another airline can meet those needs. However, if you are looking for a smooth, safe and friendly flight, United will meet those needs."
Jan 2021,10,Bad service I ever have in my life,"I booked the tickets in October 2020 with refundable policy. On Dec 2020, I had to cancel these tickets. In stead of refund my money, they purchased me more in my account without my permission. When I called to ask my refund, they required me to come in the website and fill out all the forms that they request. Why I have to do many paper works to have my money back which I not allowed me to charge on my card. The customers is really ridiculous. I never want to have credit card with them any more"
Jan 2021,20,Hawaii Vacation,"9 hours of flight one small meal on a First Class. When we came back from Honolulu it was over night flight. Departed at 7.10 pm Dinner had no choice chicken or nothing. Ask for bottle of water, They give you a small cup of water. Landed at Chicago 7.20 am with no coffee or tea service.  What is wrong with the United service..God help them Corona has them taking advantage of service.  Plus on a over night 9 hours of flying . Only a small cloth to cover your body. No blanket"
Jan 2021,10,Disappointing and disgusting,On flight 216 from Austin to Houston today- not only were we packed in the plane like sardines and definitely not like we are in the midst of pandemic. Luckily I’m not a COVID/germ freak. But for the sake of my health and those I will come in contact later I began to clean my seating area and tray. When I pulled the tray down it had coffee stains on it. Ok- I can handle that but then as I continued to clean I saw that someone had spilled there food on the tray and in the seat back pocket. Not just a little bit. One of the little wipes was not enough. The food was dried/crusted all in the pocket. Fortunately a flight attendant dropped some wipes in the aisle so I picked them up and proceeded to clean. I wish I would have thought to take a picture bc I’m sure this message does not begin to truly get my point across. My main complaint is that this made it VERY obvious that the seats are not really being cleaned and disinfected between flights as advertised for everyone’s safety. I hope that this review will have the airline step up their game in cleanliness and safety for all their future passengers.
Jan 2021,10,If only I could screw United like they screw customers,"Worst flight ever.    To start, I had to check my carry on bag, while others were allowed to keep theirs. This started the trip off poorly. But nothing huge. Then the take off got delayed 45 minutes because apparently getting baggage to the proper place on time isn't possible for these guys. Just to clarify, that's 45 minutes late to take off for what was supposed to be an hour long Flight to Greensboro. A one hour flight. A one hour flight. Yes, I'm intentionally referencing Gilligan's Island, because that's the level of competence I have seen from United. None. Then after leaving almost later than the arrival time, we circle Greensboro for 30 minutes before going to Charlotte, because of some damn Fog. But the staff refused to tell us much of anything until we were basically landing in Charlotte. Had I realized United's pilots cannot navigate fog (which is low lying clouds) I NEVER would have agreed to fly with them. Much less paying to do so. So now, because of the pathetic incompetence of thier staff, my terminally ill father (the reason for my trip) has to pick me up in Charlotte. F*** you United Airlines. You are GARBAGE"
Jan 2021,10,Worst customer service,"Our connecting flight was cancelled due to weather more than 24 hours in advance. When we arrived at the airport every other airline was still flying into Grand Rapids. We asked multiple reps at the customer service desk in Tampa and Chicago O’Hare to give us options and both reps seemed like they had no idea what was going on and offered little to no help. When we asked if there were other flights going out the following day they simply replied with “yes but they are all full.” No alternative suggestions, no offer of sympathy for the inconvenience. In my head, customer service help desk is supposed to “help” figure out alternative travel planes and accommodations. I received zero help and had to figure out how to get to a shuttle to get to the rental car place. The airplane was fully packed, there is maybe 2 inches of space between my knees and the seat in front of me (I’m 5’3”). The tray tables had crumbs and gunk on them. The wall near the window had juices dried and down the wall. The plane was super hot! The flight attendants were friendly and had smiles on their faces but the rest of my trip was extremely unpleasant. I will never be flying United again."
Dec 2020,10,Awful,"Little to no covid restrictions. Flight was unbearably packed and mask rule was not being enforced. I paid extra to have a separate seat away from people that morning, and a child and a mother were sat next to me due to some seating issues on their part. Flight attendants were not knowledgeable and did not speak any spanish, leaving many flyers confused. Seats were not fully cleaned, trash was left behind seats and on floor. Sign on backs of chairs say ""outlet in between seats"" but there was none. I had a miserable time and would not recommend."
Dec 2020,10,DO NOT USE!,"They failed to notify me my flight had been changed to 2 hour early and left me stranded having to buy a rental car in order to make it back to my military post on time. They were rude and left half way through our conversation and went home while I was trying to get a new flight booked. I had to pay 300$ for a rental car and then drive 21 hours to my destination. They also said they wouldn’t give a refund even with 3 different types of proof that I had saying my flight was at 6:30 then said “well, I don’t know what to tell you. You shouldn’t have booked it like that” I BOOKED IT THROUGH UNITED AIRLINES ON YOUR WEBSITE! WTF??? Ps. I did get the refund. Just 14 days later..."
Dec 2020,30,Had to switch planes...,"The online app for United has a lot of info, but is a little hard to work with. We took flight 628 from ORD to MSY and when we got on the plane we were told that there was maintenance being done on the plane. 45 minutes later we were told that the plane needed more checks than expected and we needed to deplane switch planes. We deplaned and waited about 1 hour for a new plane (from Int’l Terminal). We finally got in the air (2 1/2 hrs late) and everything was fine from then on. We like that United boards from back to front so people don’t have to pass each other in the rows. The entertainment on the plane is nothing more than ok. There are 8 movies (that start when the plane takes off) but you can’t fast forward or pause them. There are also about 100 DirecTV live tv channels to watch. American has better movie options."
Dec 2020,10,We paid for our luggage to travel with us and it was displaced for CARGO and was seriously delayed,"We paid $70 for our luggage ($10/bag more than other airlines) for our luggage to travel with us. It didn't because the airplane was too heavy due to another large family with CARGO .... over 8 bags of HEAVY packages go to travel with the plane, but us and several other passengers luggage did not arrive at our destination. We had terrible customer service who could not even tell us where the luggage was and finally received it 24 hours after we landed. Our medications were in our luggage because we have never had issues with our luggage. Lessons Learned there too.  Our customer service complaint was pointed to a web page to fill out a form. Really... not kidding. It took me a whole week to calm down enough to not cuss before making the complaint call.  NEVER flying United again.  Trying to get refunded the $70 fee of luggage not being transported."
Dec 2020,40,Fly the United Skies,"As part of the Star Alliance network, I have flown Houston - New Orleans - Fort Lauderdale in 2019. The lounges were clean and spacious with the essentials required between flights. It was a pity that the New Orleans terminal was brand new and the United Lounge had yet to open and receive guests."
Dec 2020,10,Never Again,"This air line cancelled my flight and booked me to a new one that would arrive 2 hours late to it's connecting flight leaving me stranded. When I called customer support they told me that they would be unable to issue me a refund (which I found out later to be a lie) and he converted my flight to travel credits. I have been trying to get a refund for months now.    Never fly with this air line, even when you do get on the plane it's sh*tty!"
Dec 2020,30,Shame On You United Airlines!,"Shame on you United Airlines. I believed you when you said ""no change fees"". SO NOT TRUE! I had to cancel my flight to Maui (from LAX) and you charged me $125 to put my points back into my account. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS! Really? Shame on you United Airlines!"
Dec 2020,20,Terrible customer service,"This is my second time flying. The first time I used American and everything was smooth and the employees were friendly. This time I used Expedia to save money and my tickets were threw United. The loading and unloading was Chaotic, and the employees weren’t helpful or friendly. The worst was when I landed and didn’t know where to get my suitcase they green tagged. The man rudely informed me that he had to grab it because i was supposed to as soon as I got off the plane and this was after I asked on my way off the plane and was told to get it at the desk. I’ll pay the extra to use American for now on!"
Dec 2020,10,Delayed bags,"Not only did my bag not make the connecting flight with more than enough time to do so (2hrs), United assured me that my bags would be delivered same day and would arrive at approximately midnight.  After 33 minutes on hold, and a link to a website that would not pull up my baggage tracking, I was informed my bags would arrive the next day (mind you this is now 1AM, assured delivery time was NLT 12AM).    Wholeheartedly dissatisfied. You made a mistake, be professionals and make it right."
Dec 2020,20,"24 hour journey with infant, delayed flights and breached safety protocol.","I took a flight from St. John's NL, Canada to Houston TX. The flight duration was 24 hours due to long layovers and delayed flights as the aircraft required engine maintenance. I spoke to a supervisor requesting to reroute us with shorter delays, they denied us. I was travelling with a 5 month old infant. We ran out of food and diapers. On our last flight after a 6 hour delay, all passengers were boarded onto the aircraft and the engine would not start (again). This meant no air circulation or more importantly, filtration. This is a safety risk during airborne COVID 19 pandemic. After 3 flights, more than 14 hours of unplanned delays and layovers, and 24 hours of combined travel, all United Airlines offered us was $50 travel voucher. Very poor customer appreciation."
Dec 2020,30,Stay away from United Airlines.,Think twice before you fly United Airlines. We booked tickets for our daughter and son in law back in October for them to come home for the holidays. The are both serving in the Army. So we paid 225 extra for each ticket so that they could fly out from the. Awe they are stationed at. The night before they were to fly out we get an email that they canceled the flight we had booked but scheduled them on another flight from an airport that was an hour and a half away from them. They had to go that night and pay for a hotel along with paying to park their car for 2 weeks in the airport parking lot. United as of now has done nothing to rectify this. I understand changing times but how do they think it is ok to completely change the airport. They seriously need to compensate us for all the charges that incurred bevy of them. Stay away from this airline.
Dec 2020,10,The worst customer service,"My flight was canceled due 2 the pandemic back in March 2020 which I clearly understand. United forced me 2 take a flight credit at that time and refused 2 give me a refund. My credit will end February 2021 so witb the pandemic still going strong I decided to call United on 12/2/20 talked with a representative letting him know I was not going anywhere by the time my credit would expire, so the rep says do you want a refund, I was shocked since they did not want to give me one back in March 2020. So I said yes the representative said ok it will go back on card ending in 7477 in about 7 days. So in 9 business days I called back because I have not received my refund, now the lady said it will take 14 business days not 7 so look by the 22nd of December. So as of the 24th of December NOTHING so I called back only 2 be told by another person they show no request of me asking for a refund I am 😡😡😡😡😡😡 so now this is the 3rd representative who sounds like they are not from the USA giving me a run around, so I demand a supervisor. When the Supervisor got on the line sounds like an American he tells me does not show request from 12/2, so I ask him your calls are recorded right he tells me not all of them, GO FIGURE! so now I have 2 wait another 14 business days for there screw up. Bottom line I'm filing complaints, I have records of who I spoke with and recordings.    United customer service is the WORST"
Dec 2020,10,Horrible flight,Worst airline experience of my life! I’ll never fly United again! Abusive representatives ...Naomi W. at LAX United baggage check was a bully! I’m truly appalled at the treatment and behavior...had to post this. Please don’t be abused by this airline.
Dec 2020,10,They cancel flights and claim they will refund your money,"It’s been 11 weeks since they cancelled our flight. No refund in sight. We had the money to pay for the trip ONCE. Not twice... I had no idea the refund was going to take 3 months (or more... haven’t gotten it yet). So on the consumer side, you get to pay interest for months before you get the refund, and you get to stress about it the whole time. Book with Delta... This is a joke."
Dec 2020,10,Absolutely the worst airline,We continually say we will never fly United and then are tempted by the lower fares on Expedia. Never again! They have run late almost every flight we’ve taken. They have completely canceled flights we’ve booked after waiting to board for hours. The attendants are typically the rudest of all airlines. We are adamant to say to NOT FLY UNITED!
Dec 2020,10,LYING DIRTY THIEVES,"I bought a ticket with United via customer service who told me I would be able to bring my dog on the flight. The dog is 3 days from being 4 months old the day of the flight. I was told multiple times this would be ok. DAY OF THE FLIGHT at check in, I was denied because dog was 3 days away from being 4 months. They denied me a refund. I stayed on hold for an hour. They hung up on me twice when I called back. It’s completely ridiculous to get someone to buy a ticket under false pretenses and then deny a refund. The ticket was almost 400$!!!! United must be hurting for money. Their customer service is horrible. Their policies are horrible. DO NOT EVER fly United. They need to go to hell. All of them."
Dec 2020,10,WAY BEHIND,United was suppose to board at 715. Intercom lady chimes in around 720 and says we will board in 5 min. With no further updates it is now 743 and still waiting to board. Will never recommend united. Got stuck with this flight as its the only one stop shop. Might as well make multiple stops and still would be there at the same time. Highly disappointed in united.
Dec 2020,10,If I could give them a 0 I would,"This airline is horrible. I will never fly with them again. Their customer service is atrocious. How do you misplace travel credits? I spent over 400 dollars and called to cancel my flight and know that I have travel credits, yet when I try to call and ask they tell me I have none. I am so beyond annoyed and over this airlines. Also their prices are expensive for what?"
Dec 2020,10,Incompetent Personnel,"Dec 26th. While at the airport I tried to get a flight reserved with United 2.5 hours before the flight. Went to their website and it said nothing available. Went to the gate and she said nothing available. Went to the checking counter to see if I could get a standby and they said the seats were available but I would have to call 1-800 number or reserve it online. By that time I had wasted 1.5 hours just trying to get on the flight headed to Houston. Finally I tried the phone app and it showed the seats were available, gave me the price and took me to reservation screen, which declined my reservation by saying that I was within the 60 minutes of the flying time. Sharing this story so others might know that you might be better off using the phone app than incompetent people at the airport. Pathetic service United. Hope to see you go out of business soon..."
Dec 2020,10,Not COVID Safe,"Over the summer during the COVID-19 pandemic, my husband and I flew Delta and were so impressed with the way the company was taking precautions. We thought United would be following similar guidelines when we decided to fly in December. However, the flight was full and we sat next to a stranger (who did not wear her mask for the first 15 minutes while she “drank her coffee” & scrolled through instagram) for three hours on the plane.    Not only that, but you have to pay to upgrade your seat to bring a carry on bag or pay about $75 to check a bag. Wouldn’t recommend United."
Dec 2020,10,Checking in,"One of the worst flying experiences I have had in my whole career starting from checking in to hoarding flight. The system was broken, couldn’t scan properly once written everything manually it took lots of time for associates to come and check it. They were really short staffed, 8 self check in spots and only 2 people doing everything. The system kept asking for associate. Associates weren’t very kind and helping, they were very rude and disrespecting by saying “AHGG NOT AGAIN” when he had to come to assist me. I don’t write a bad review generally but this was so uncomfortable and so stressing that i had to wait for 30min just to check in and I had to write this."
Dec 2020,10,DONT FLY UNITED!,My experience flying with United has been terrible on MULTIPLE occasions. This is more so geared toward the outsourcing of customer service and lack of having an ability to relate to the customer and the situation. United does not and will not keep their word on what is stated when a flight is purchased. Through loopholes in verbiage you WILL see how the customer is cared for and the ways they are able to request funds for emergency situation during COVID. The 3 reps I spoke to had ZERO empathy and understanding. I wouldn’t fly United if I got the ticket for FREE!
Dec 2020,40,Dec - UA4306 Knoxville to Washington/Dulles EMB-145 (#N14148) E+ Seats 18C & D,"Dec - UA4306 Knoxville to Washington/Dulles EMB-145 (#N14148) E+ Seats 18C & D    On Thursday, December 10, we flew United Airlines UA4306, on an EMB-145 (#N14148) from Knoxville (TYS) to Washington/Dulles (IAD), as the first leg of our flight home to Phoenix (PHX). This flight was operated by Commutair, dba United Express. We had seats 18C & D, which are deemed as Economy Plus, and are the Exit Row seats. Originally, one of those seats was taken, and we had 5C & D, but I kept checking the United App, and when I saw that the Exit Row seats both became available, I moved us to those.    We stopped into Ruby Tuesday, just past Security at TYS, for some wines, and a snack, then took in the new art installation in the airport, before heading to our gate, 11. On this visit to TYS, we noticed that the Quiznos/Uno/Cinnabon shops were open, and the Starbucks was closed. The retail shops, both landside and airside, were open for business.    The plane was there, having come in from IAH earlier, and it was being sanitized. We boarded on time, and pushed back from the gate promptly. We loaded from the rear of the aircraft, so it really did not make any difference that as Global Services, we boarded first. Our Flight Attendant had sanitizing wipes ready.    We were off for the short flight to IAD, with clouds and haze. Our takeoff was smooth, and we vectored out over the Tennessee River lakes, then just west of downtown Knoxville, before turning toward Washington/Dulles. We had clouds all of the way to the Virginia countryside, and did the normal circle around IAD, before landing.    The flight was uneventful, and short - a good thing, as we are not fond of flying the EMB-145, even in the extra legroom Exit Row seats. There was a quick beverage service, and we shared a Ginger Ale.    This plane did not have IFE, or WiFi. Everything seemed to be in good working order, unlike our similar flight (TYS-ORD) in August, when interior panels were loose, on both exit doors. Nothing structural, but slightly disconcerting, when the panels over the exit door latches fall off, during the flight.    The landing was about as smooth, as I have ever encountered on a small commuter aircraft, and I attribute that to the female Captain - she had a great touch.    Our Flight Attendant was a pleasure, and very friendly.    We will likely be taking this flight again in February."
Dec 2020,40,Dec - UA444 Phoenix to Washington/Dulles 737-900ER (#3473) FC Seats 3A & B,"Dec - UA444 Phoenix to Washington/Dulles 737-900ER (#3473) FC Seats 3A & B    On Friday, December 04, we flew United Airlines UA444 from PHX to IAD on a 737-900ER (#3473) in First Class, seats 3A & B. This was the first leg of a leisure trip to Blackberry Farm, in Walland, TN, so we were flying into Knoxville Airport (TYS), as our final destination, the next morning. In the COVID era, the flights were limited, hence our need to overnight at IAD, and fly into TYS the next day. During this time of COVID, this was only the fifth flight, since late-March, and all on United.    While we had flown out of the newly renovated Terminal 3 (E Gates), several times, essentially from the day that United moved their operations there, things were changing. There were now more restaurants and bars in Terminal 3, and near the United E Gates. This terminal was starting to take shape, and the airport was doing a good job at pointing out the dining/drinking options available now. They were also doing a good job, with signage describing the new rules (mainly masking and distancing, but also sanitizing escalator handrails with UV light), and we saw even more hand sanitizing stations, than in August. United had also added more informational signs, in the E Gate area. Hemispheres magazine is still missing from the seatback pocket, and that is understandable. One side note was that the Safety Card was for a Boeing 737-800, and not the 900 we were flying.    Our plane had arrived from IAD the evening before, so there was plenty of time to sanitize it. We have noticed that the turnaround times for United flights has increased quite a bit.    We had our luggage checked downstairs in T3, and were quickly up the escalator to the TSA Security point. The Clear line was open, so we opted to use that, though we also have TSA Pre-Check. We were through the almost empty security lines in moments, and headed to our gate, E-3. Up until this time, we had only flown out of E-3, or E-5.    I talked to the Gate Agent about the new United Club, located at E-3, and he validated my observations: no work had been done on it, since August, but that is understandable, due to fewer flights into/out of PHX at this time. The airport, while not empty, was nearly so. Everyone, who we observed, was complying with the mask mandate, and United had advisories on masks everywhere. When we boarded, we were handed sanitizing wipes.    On our last previous flight on UA, out of PHX, the boarding order was a bit of a mess. It seems that they now have that part down: passengers with disabilities, or needing more time, uniformed military, Global Services, 1K, and then, rear to front boarding by row number.    We were in our seats, with carry-on luggage stored, before anyone else boarded. My wife’s small roller briefcase was stored overhead, and my hat, small briefcase and her purse, stored under the seats in Row 2. This 737-900 was one of the newer ones, with the “Dreamliner” ceiling, and lighting, and the larger overhead bins. Looking around, none in First Class were full. Our jackets were hanging in the closet quickly. As in August, no pre-departure beverages were served. The First Class cabin looked pretty full, but unfortunately, the monitors at the gate do not seem to be showing the seating diagram, so I cannot comment on how full the plane was. If I had to guess, I would say about 50%, but that is only from watching the passengers file past, and nothing else.    We had the PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) with streamed content to our tablets via the United App. This worked well, but we both found the selections to be limited, but did find something to watch. I did spend some time looking out of my window, but with the haze and clouds, there was not all that much to see.    Our seats were comfortable, with good legroom and adequate width. Everything on the plane functioned well.    We did have wine available, but it was the Camelot California Chardonnay, in the 0.1875 plastic bottle - not a favorite of ours, but this seems the normal white wine now. We had a snack box option, and chose the Tapas Box:  Olives  Humus  Flatbread  Bruschetta Sauce  Parmesan Cheese Spread  Almonds  Gin-gin Candy (very sticky, and a good way to pull a crown, or filling)    Before, we have had a choice between their “Classic,” and the “Tapas,” and are less impressed by the Classic. On this flight, we had no choice, but were fine with what we had - besides, we were dining early at the IAD Hilton, so no big deal.    Our flight path took us parallel to the Salt River with its reservoirs, dams and soaring cliff faces, then out over the high desert. We had light haze, that built up by the time we were over New Mexico, with a few breaks over the Texas Panhandle, and Oklahoma (lots of wind farms), all of the way into IAD. The flight was smooth, and on-time.    Service on-board was very friendly, and efficient, as had been our experience at the gate at PHX.    We had done about the same trip, back in August, but had done the overnight connection at Chicago O’Hare (ORD), instead of Washington/Dulles (IAD), and Chicago had been a virtual ghost town, with nearly all restaurants and bars closed, and few passengers. Not so at IAD, as it was very crowded, with much more (though certainly not all) open - seemed like a normal day, except for the mask, signs and 6' distancing dots on the floors - a totally different scene from O’Hare, just a few months before.    We arrived at Gate D-6 on-time, and deplaned from the front (First Class) of the aircraft, so were essentially the first off of the plane.    We were off to Carousel 5 for our luggage, and then the shuttle to the Hilton Washington/Dulles hotel for our overnight, before coming back to the airport, and our flight over to Knoxville (TYS).  In all, and considering all of the COVID precautions, a very nice flight."
Dec 2020,40,Dec - UA4318 Washington/Dulles to Knoxville EMB-145 (#N11191) E+ Seats 18C & D,"Dec - UA4318 Washington/Dulles to Knoxville EMB-145 (#N11191) E+ Seats 18C & D    On Saturday, December 05, we flew United Airlines flight UA4318, from Washington/Dulles (IAD), to Knoxville McGhee Tyson (TYS), on a EMB-145 #N11191 (scheduled to be #N12175, then N14148*), operated by Commutair Airlines, dba United Express, in E+, seats 18C & D - Exit Row seats. The EMB-145 is our least favorite aircraft in the United/United Express fleet, but that is about our only choice nowadays, into TYS.    * The second plane was swapped out for this one, so we were now about 30 minutes late, but had nothing to do, other than check into our inn in Maryville, for the evening. When we taxied out, we thought there was an issue with this plane too, as the Captain pulled to the side of the taxiway, and ran the engines up a few times, paused, then did that again. I was thinking the worst, but obviously everything met with his satisfaction, and we were off.    We had flown into IAD the evening before, and overnighted at the Hilton IAD, so were close to the airport. We had gotten breakfast at the hotel, and that was a good thing, as much in this area of IAD was closed, though it was very, very busy in the Main Terminal - surprisingly busy. Also, there is virtually nothing in the way of restaurants and bars on the A Concourse. We had planned to stop into a wine bar on the adjacent B Concourse, and took advantage of being at the airport early. Unlike our flight out of Chicago O’Hare (ORD) in August, IAD was very busy, and except of Concourses A and B, much more was open. Unlike IAD with our arrival the evening before, on the D Concourse, both Concourse A and B were rather empty, with more closed, including some of the international airlines’ lounges on the B Concourse - all of the crowds were on the C and D Concourses, or so it seemed.    The A Concourse gates have multiple sub-gates, so for instance A5 will have A5A, B, C, D, etc. We were going out of A5F, but the flight was moved to A5B - basically exit the terminal from the same door, but then exit to the tarmac through one of 5 doors, so no real change at all. Besides, there is staff to check your boarding pass twice, before you are allowed to board the aircraft, which is done via a stairway.    We received our United Hand Sanitizing packets, made our way to the Exit Row (18), and stowed my wife’s small, rolling briefcase below the Row 12 (row numbers jump from 12 to 18, at that point) seat, and my small briefcase in the limited overhead bin. Note: on the EMB-145, there are only bins above the C & D seats (starboard side of the plane), and none above the single A seats (no B seats). The bins are tiny, and the door slides down to open. There is also a step-up of about 2"" from the aisle, and with the low ceiling, one will likely hit their head - after maybe 100 flights on EMB-145's, I still manage to do so, maybe every third flight. The support for the C & D seats are at either end, so the space is fairly wide, but not that high, so anything larger than my wife’s briefcase, will just not fit.    The Exit Row seats have about 4"" additional legroom, which is one reason that we like them. Due to the curvature of the fuselage, there is less foot room for the passenger in the D seat. The view is partially obscured by the wing, and then a sign on the window, identifying this as an “Exit Row,” but as the weather is nearly always cloudy into/out of TYS, there is not that much to see, or to photograph.    Though late, we were airborne, and had an uneventful flight over the mountains to Knoxville. We were a bit late, but that was not of consequence to us. There was one brief beverage service, and that was all. There was no IFE, or WiFi service on this plane.    As far as COVID precautions, there were stickers on the floor at IAD, near the gate, for distancing, and plenty of hand sanitizer stations, plus signage instructing all passengers that masks must be worn in the airport, and on the plane. The plane spent more time on the stand, being sanitized, between flights. Everyone on-board was complying with the mask mandate. As mentioned, United passed out sanitizing wipes, upon boarding.    Though on our least favorite aircraft, this was a nice flight, with a very good Flight Attendant. We will likely be taking this flight again in February."
Dec 2020,40,Dec - UA1470 Washington/Dulles to Phoenix 737-900 (#3473) FC Seats 3E & F,"Dec - UA1470 Washington/Dulles to Phoenix 737-900 (#3473) FC Seats 3E & F    On Thursday, December 10, we flew UA1470 from Washington/Dulles (IAD) home to Phoenix (PHX) on a 737-900 (#3473), in First Class, seats 3E & F. The weather at IAD was cloudy, and getting dark. We had just flown in from Knoxville (TYS), so had arrived at the “commuter terminal,” A, but had plenty of time for our connection. We stopped along the way at the United Club, next to our departure gate, Gate C-6, for a bit of wine. I was surprised at how full the United Club was, but then all concourses at IAD looked like a pre-COVID day - except that many restaurants and bars were closed - still lots of crowds though.    We walked “next door” to C-6, and boarded on-time. The boarding order was mostly the same, as pre-COVID, down through 1K passengers, and then the boarding switched to the back of the plane forward. The Flight Attendants were handing out sanitizing wipes, as we boarded. Since we are Global Services, we boarded behind the first group: those with disabilities, or needing more time. No uniformed military on this flight, which seemed about 50% full, with First Class only being about 60% full, and one couple getting their upgrade at the gate. As I have not been seeing the seating plan on the monitors at the gates lately, I am only guessing on the number of passengers total.    We had our carry-on bags stored in the overhead bins, and below the seats in Row 2. This was one of the newer 737-900's, with the larger overhead bins, so plenty of room. The bin above us, only had my wife’s small, wheeled briefcase in it.    There was no pre-departure beverage in First Class, and in-flight, we had a snack. Lately, we have been seeing the Classic, or Tapas snack boxes offered, but this flight had the Tapas box, or a sort of “pizza sandwich,” which we both chose. It was not bad, and something a bit different. The white wines were the Camelot, or a new one to us: Calitopia California Chardonnay. Both were in the 0.1875 plastic bottles (and plastic cups), and this new one was the better. We had just asked for a Chardonnay, and got one of each - my wife getting the new one. After a sip of it, I ordered the Calitopia Chard, for my next round. While not a great, or complex Chardonnay (especially in a plastic cup), it was far better than the Camelot.    We got a second handout of sanitizing wipes, after the meal, which was a nice addition.    One of the charging sockets, in the front of the podium between our seats had become dislodged, but still functioned well, and my wife was able to charge her iPhone from it.    The seats were comfortable, with adequate legroom, and all was in good working order. We had the PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) with streamed content to our tablets via the United App. This worked well, but we both found the selection of movies, and TV shows to be quite sparse, but found something to occupy the time - especially as it was dark, so there was little to see outside of the window. However, the weather cleared nicely, so there were quite a few cities that were beautifully laid out in the darkness - just not photographs. Why do I not get such clear weather during the daylight? We did pick up low clouds, right until the western edge of Phoenix, when it cleared again. It was nice seeing the Holiday lights around Phoenix, as we made our approach.    We had quite a few bumps along the way, and especially close to PHX, so the seatbelt light stayed on for much of the flight. Even with the turbulence, the pilot stuck the landing, and we were at the gate rather early. That was fine for us, as we were arriving home late, so an extra 30 minutes of time was welcome. Our luggage was out almost instantly onto Carousel 5, and we were headed home.    The Gate Agents at IAD had been very good, as was our entire Cabin Crew.    It appeared that everyone on-board was complying with the mask mandate, and those around us seemed to be wearing them properly. One slight oddity was that one of the passengers, across the aisle from us, had come aboard in shorts, a hoodie and his mask. Once airborne, he changed into a full set of PPE’s (“bunny suit”) with a hood, his mask and a full face shield? His traveling companion just kept her mask on, and no change of clothing. Also, though more crowded, than I had expected (having recently flown through ORD), all but a very few individuals seemed to be correctly masked, and those few, who were not, were easy to avoid."
Dec 2020,10,terrible service,"Flight was delayed almost for three hours, never heard any apologies.  When flight finally started at 7 pm they switched the lights off and never put them on.. even when we landed at 9. 30 pm everybody was collecting their belongings using iphone lights... and!...there were not individual lights in plane )))  rude representatives in airports all around the country."
Dec 2020,10,Cancelled flight with no notification,United cancelled our outbound flight without any notification to us. They emailed earlier that flight had changed by 5 minutes. Not a big deal . I just happened to get on my mileage plus account to review trip. There was a notification to contact United to get tickets reissued. Our flight home had changed drastically so I called the customer service. The gentleman on the phone explained that our outbound fight to Cabo had been cancelled and we needed to rebook. He explained that if we rebooked our only option was an overnight stay in Chicago. We had absolutely no idea that they cancelled our flight. Will not use United again.
Dec 2020,40,Pre-Covid- but pretty family friendly service,Flight attendants for the LA-Maui flight tend to be pretty family friendly and are used to helping families out where they can. I tend to find that they are pretty accommodating and helpful.
Dec 2020,10,The worst customer service in the industry,"The day before my flight I got a text message stating that my previous reservation was full and they were looking to switch free of charge. Since I was flexible it was no problem, but I would have never if if I knew the nightmare that United was going throw me through.  My new reservation was connecting in DC, and getting there was no problem. However, the plane that was scheduled to take us to FLL needed maintenance and they had to find new accommodations. They proceeded to tell us they were working on the problem, and we were expected to leave with an hour. This happened for the next six hours with a new excuse every time. I know the basic psychology behind the waiting game so that did not bother me. However, what was frustrating about the entire situation was that I offered to fly into west palm, which had availability and left an hour after our original reservation, but was not aloud to due to my ticket. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. United does not care about your experience or your time. They will do everything possible to keep you waiting and fit their schedule. Oh, but thanks for the cheezits, really hit the spot and was well Worth my unnecessary six hour wait."
Dec 2020,10,How to get COVID,They blast a message in the airport every 5 minutes that says to stay 6 feet apart and there are signs everywhere repeating this. Get on a United flight and it’s packed though. 1 Star. All categories. No exceptions.
Dec 2020,30,Standard Flight from Chicago to Boston,"Gets you there, but really nothing extra or special. United also tends to not be the cleanest or newest planes, so I really only take it when the price is much cheaper than any alternatives. For a short flight, the money saved was worth it."
Dec 2020,20,Please be more mindful,Even though the flight attendants were nice and attentive I can’t believe United airlines is allowing full flights in the middle of a pandemic. I traveled to sto dgo and back and the aircraft was extremely full of people. I am really disappointed of the lack of respect that the airline has for human life.    You guys could do better. It should not be only about the money. If you don’t care about the people traveling at least care about your flight attendants who are getting exposed to hundreds of people that come from different places that they might not know what they are exposed to. Please be more mindful. Thank you.
Dec 2020,10,Incompetent,I don't fly United often and will avoid at all costs. Best words I can use to describe their boarding process is a cluster f**k. People were carrying on so much crap then they are struggling to find room for everyone's bags. It's was a comedy if I hadn't spent extra for 4 first class seats. Awful...
Dec 2020,10,Absolutely awful,"Showed up to a small airport 27 minutes before the flight set to depart. Zero lines, nobody else there. Literally one plane flying out of the airport. There's nobody at the United airlines desk, I had to go get a security guard. Apparently there is a regulation that you cannot check in less than 30 minutes before a flight. Great, except it didn't say this on any of the information I received. I tried to check in online, but for some reason, United does not allow basic economy to check in online. 500 bucks a ticket and I can't use your website to check in? Absolutely absurd.    Then, when I call support to get the flight changed, I'm repeatedly called a liar and yelled at by the supervisor. She kept telling me that there would have been someone there, and that I should have known. Nobody can give me an answer as to how I was supposed to know what the cutoff was, when the only information I had said the flight left at 7:40. No recommended check in time, no warning about a check in deadline, absolutely nothing. And I'm supposed to magically know what the federal guidelines are?    The supervisor actually just hung up on me. So the general customer service attitude is: you should know all of the flying guidelines, even though we don't give you that information, and if you don't know what we know, it's your fault. Absolutely atrocious customer service. I will never give this company my money again."
Dec 2020,10,Unpunctual Pilots and Terrible Customer Service!!!!,"My flight was delayed an hour because the pilots were late (the pilots said “sorry for being late” as they walked through the terminal...this was a 07:30 flight out of Hayden, CO so it wasn’t like another flight had delayed them, THEY WERE JUST LATE). This event caused me to miss my connecting flight by 5 minutes which they refused to hold the gate for me while I sprinted from one end of the terminal to the other (approximately a 600yard dash). After missing my connection the customer service representatives told me my next flight would be 8.5 hours later!!!! I asked if I had any other options in terms of flying into another airport and the look on their faces screamed utter disgust because I asked them to do their job. Needless to say if you have somewhere to be then don’t count on United Airlines!!!"
Dec 2020,10,Thanks for the Covid,"Recently flew united via their affiliate Copa Airlines from Newark to Panama City, and then returned on a standard United flight. It is pretty astounding to me that during a time when the world has been brought to it's knees and in many ways has worked together to avoid and minimize the risks of Covid-19 infection, this airline prioritizes an extra $40 or so in ""upgrade fees"" over the health and safety of it's customers. Rather than spreading people out as much as possible, passengers are seated shoulder to shoulder. I attempted to sit in a completely empty row, and was rudely asked by the flight attendant if ""I had my credit card ready?"" When I asked why I couldn't sit there considering the flight was fully boarded, I was told it was an upcharge to sit there. Or in any of the other multitude of empty rows only a few up from my assigned seat. When I explained I would be more comfortable not sitting shoulder to shoulder in my row, I was told the airline ""Had no responsibility to space people out."" Low and behold here I am back home in New York, and sure enough just tested positive for Covid-19. So thank you United Airlines for your complete lack of consideration for mine or your other passengers' health over a small surcharge, and in turn for completely ruining my holidays and exposing me to the novel coronavirus."
Dec 2020,10,Bad,We get here at 11 am like more thnt 2 hours the fly is delayed because they waiting for 2 people why full plane have to wait 8f they get laid its not our problem at all hoping we don loose our connection fly i will really complain for real
Dec 2020,50,VERY pleased with United during my flights home to Canada from Sydney!,"I was VERY impressed with my United experience coming home from studying in Australia that I had to post a review. The airline staff, cleanliness of the aircrafts and the support from United was great during my flights from Sydney to Vancouver. Even the customer service phone call I made beforehand was great, the representative was kind and all of my questions were answered!    They ensured all our needs were met onboard, I have no complaints! I would definitely fly with United again."
Dec 2020,10,Rude Flight Attendant in First Class,"I travel first class on occasion, especially when I travel internationally. I was on a United Airlines connecting flight from Chicago O'Hare to Indianapolis International on November 29, 2020. I was in the first row. I obviously did not have any seat in front of me to place a bag, so my carry-on had to be stowed above. However, I always carry a small purse that has my phone, gum, etc. in it. I am a small lady. My purse straps to my body and rests in the seat with me. A young flight attendant, definitely in her early 20's, rudely insisted my purse be stowed in the overhead compartment. I argued that my purse is small, it's not a carry-on bag, it's in my seat beside me, and it is like this on every flight (I had been on four flights that week, not one flight attendant had any issue with it being with me in my seat). She would not have it any other way. She exclaimed that the other flight attendants were not ""doing their jobs"" and she's ""doing her job."" It was late, I just wanted to go home. It went up in the overhead compartment. She put it up there and shut the compartment door. She sat in her seat and buckled her seat belt for take-off. The plane started to taxi, as we were ready to take off. The compartment door that SHE CLOSED, flew open. She had no clue it was open. She sat there totally oblivious. She was so concerned about my tiny purse that was strapped to by body being a danger, yet here's a compartment door wide open, ready for stuff to come flying out as soon as the plane takes off due to her negligence. I had to tell her it was open for her to get up and close it, otherwise, it would have remained open. This flight attendant remained incredibly unfriendly and unapproachable throughout the flight. I was dissatisfied with United Airlines First Class treatment. I am a very easy going person. I do not know why this girl was so aggressive, however, I feel like it was a power issue. I do not wish to fly with this airline again. There are other airlines to choose from that I have certainly received much better first class treatment! However, I know some of my family still has airline credits from COVID cancellations so I may be forced to fly with them again due to family obligations."
Dec 2020,10,Not COVID safe,"During a pandemic they make everyone in regular economy stay in their seats, crammed in the back of the plane with no one in the 10+ rows in economy plus. They care more about customers paying for economy plus than actually keeping people safe on their aircraft. Shame on them."
Dec 2020,10,Delay by 3 hours,Brilliant. Apparently technical issues in the cockpit. Delay by more than 3 hours. Would rate them 0
Dec 2020,10,Dangerous to fly with United,"I had a flight scheduled and when I had to miss it due to having COVID they canceled all of my flights. While I still needed my second flight. When calling United they wanted to charge me more money to give me what I had already paid for. On top of it they told me that I should fly even if I have COVID in order not to lose my flights. I thought I was doing the right thing by not flying with COVID, but apparently United does not think so. Be aware if you fly with them you probably have a higher chance of COVID than with other airlines."
Dec 2020,10,Hold Time,"I don't understand how you request a call back after a 40 min hold time to then be number 1 in queue to still have to wait on hold for over 20 minutes. Extremely poor management of the phone lines. If you can't reach an agent to ask a question, why would I want to invest my money in this company? I try to fly United because my dad has worked for this company for over 30 years but it's definitely time to move on."
Dec 2020,10,Very Inflexible if especially if you don't purchase tickets directly from United,"We are not allowed to purchase any Class of Service upgrades, nor bring any luggage onboard because we purchased the economy tickets from Expedia (a travel agency), and did not purchase the tickets directly from United. We can't even pay to bring one luggage onboard. they are entirely too inflexible. I called Delta, which is our return flight and they allow each person in our party to carry on a bag and a personal item and at no extra charge. I had issues with United the last time I flew, but decided to overlook it. Never again. It's the last time I fly United."
Dec 2020,10,Stay Away,"This airline should be shut down, the service is absolutely horrific, the flight was terrible and they don't care."
Dec 2020,20,The smooth-brains at united,"So I guess it’s not everyone but I’ve flown a ton of times with United. Always had my one bag to put overhead and one carry-on bag. Flew from Orlando to Chicago, no problems. On the way back as I’m about to enter the plane, literally never before I get told my bag is too big and needs to be checked in. This bag has literally been in the overhead on the way to Chicago on a smaller plane with a much much larger amount of people. This one going back to Orlando was about 1/3 full. I literally tell the woman I’ll bring her on the plane. (if she’s even seen what the inside of a plane looks like with her greeting job that she got shoved to) to show her that my bag will fit, just as it fit on the way to Chicago.    There’s nothing I hate more than stupid people, blindly following their autistic belief without seeing the correct choice. Who hired this waste of air. Unfortunately I don’t have their name.    The funniest part is that I’ve had an acquaintance go through the same thing. He literally said all he has to do is carry his bag instead of roll it and they don’t pay attention. That’s how smooth-brained these freaks are. What kind of brainlet Is literally this dumb."
Dec 2020,10,Worst airline,"United airlines always prove how terrible they are. They have nastiest flight attendants in the business ,always over selling their flights, damaged luggage delayed flight, horrible costumer service, dirty planes.  I will be a little extra for a better air line."
Dec 2020,10,Horrible Staff and Crew,"Rude staff, Horrible planes... Pretty much anything you can think of... Horrible airline, Not to mention their lack of care for human dignity"
Dec 2020,10,Horrible horrible horrible service and experience,"Added a dog and got absolutely no details on specifications for paperwork, crate/carrier, etc. Checked in 5+ times the month leading up to the trip and never once got specifications on the crate size for my pet til 3 days prior. Ended up cancelling and just driving. I would rather spend more money on gas than spend anymore time dealing with these useless travel agents at United. I will never never never fly with these people again. I would rather spend an additional $300 with another flight agency than fly with United. I will tell my friends and family about this experience anytime flying is ever brought up again for the rest of my life. United only cares about getting your money, don't ever fly with them."
Dec 2020,40,A nice flight,Very nice flight attendants. Our flight was rather crowded. But it was on time and comfortable. i liked it.
Dec 2020,40,NA,"I flew with my kids and the basic economy seats are not assigned and no family or group seating. I asked the woman at the gate if there was any way my kids could sit together and they made sure we all sat together. It was really nice and same on the way bsck, they even upgraded us to business class on the return flight"
Dec 2020,10,Never again,Had a terrible experience with them. Partly my fault because I booked the tickets on Lufthansa’s website so I did not realize they were operated by United. They had very poor measures to deal with social distancing or masks and were generally speaking disorganized. They also packed the plane without spacing the passengers at all. I will change my return ticket - not going to fly with them again.
Dec 2020,10,Worst airline who don’t care about customers.,"Anything wrong that you can imagine while flying with airlines May turn into reality if you choose United airlines. I have experience missing baggage, rude staff, poor service, worst food etc in my first flight itself with United.  Stay away & choose something better even if it’s little expensive."
Dec 2020,10,Always terrible,"Got told I can’t bring my regular, school sized backpack on the plane, it was my only piece of luggage. But they wanted me to check it so they could get money. I paid to check it, then I just walked off and got on the plane with it and put it under the seat like always.    They are always the worst airline to fly on. Just garbage."
Dec 2020,10,Very Rude Service and Crowded.,"-This is a long one, so I apologize and the one time I wish I would have taken pictures  Unfortunatley I had a layover for my flight into Orlando at the Chicago O'Hare Airport. After just flying a really great flight into Chicago I was amazed at the service of my next flight.    The Chicago Airport was as jam packed as it always is. . .once they began boarding you could barely hear the woman speaking. Instead of boarding the plane from first class than back to front(like should be done if they are worried of a virus spreading) it was all over the place. It took us 45 mins to board and than not everyone was even close to sitting. Than we had a problem with a door not working so we sat on the turnpike for another half hour. No communication on our new arrival time. And during our time of waiting the flight attendants haf the audacity to continuous bully this little girl who kept taking off her mask. A little girl, there was no nice way of asking her either. The first flight attendant a man said put on the mask or he will go get his big mean boss. And than the next minute this lady is over the girl informing her she take the next mask they have and put it on or than she looked at her mom and said you can comply or you will never ridr eith United again. The mom apologized over and over again and tried to get the little girl to wear it. The man flight attendant came back to ask a gentleman sitting on the other side if he was with them (he was not) and told him he needed to move. He said I have no problem sitting here they than pushed him to move. The 'boss' came back during this time and said ooh do we have a problem again with your little girl. Little girl was in the other seat across the aisle from the gentleman they made move. I cannot believe how much they harrassed this family over and over again. If someone is worried about a little girl not wearing her mask properly than you have some serious problems and therefore should not be flying on this already packed flight (to which we all took our masks off to eat) and should not be flying the friendly skies.    I have read on several reviews that people stressed because people were taking their masks off. Ridiculous statement because if you are arm to arm with everyone for an entire flight and take your mask off anyway to eat. . .quit your fuss because it is recycled air anyway the whole flight. Sooo if you are worried this much about face covering amd catching something maybe you should not be flying."
Dec 2020,10,NEVER FLYING UNITED AIRLINES AGAIN!,"UNITED AIRLINES SUCKS! WORST AIRLINE IN THE WORLD! BOYCOTT THEM AND PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS! Paid $4495 for first class trip from Austin to Lihue. Get delayed 2 hours in Denver and have to depart and change planes. The plane we were on had fully reclinable seats into a horizontal position, and full entertainment options with movie screens. The plane we were changed to had NONE of that. Basically could have got the same seat in Coach in an exit aisle! First row of first class had NOTHING in front of you, NO ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AT ALL! Seats BARELY reclined! Complained to the Stewardess, who basically said ""You're lucky to be flying at all."" I said I wanted a refund and she said I would have to get off the plane for that and not take the flight. I said I will take it up with customer service later. Customer service said sorry, but you still got a first class flight, and we aren't offering you anything in compensation. I will be pursuing legal action against United Airlines because I did NOT receive WHAT I PAID FOR! Please everyone who has had a terrible experience with United NEVER FLY THEM AGAIN!"
Dec 2020,50,Portland Airport & Flight,"I was very pleased with all the staff at the Portland Airport and the flight from Portland to Chicago. The flight attendant were very nice the flight, even for a middle of the day flight was not packed and we landed a few minutes earlier than expected. Very please with services and flights from Portland Maine Airport."
Dec 2020,10,Flight attendants are the worst,"The flight attendants on every single flight (Wichita—>Denver—>San Francisco—>Honolulu) wouldn’t stop harassing people on the plane. I’ve never seen so many rude employees in one confined area. They got mad at people in the exit row stating the “rules,” “dont put that there. Put your laptop away” “wear your mask, not under the nose, over the nose NOT UNDER.” “You think this is bad, Hawaii has a $5,000 fine and a year in prison if you don’t.” Like seriously, ask people nicely to do the things you need them too without being total a**** about it. We are all adults don’t treat us like children.    Ask nicely for people to fill out their forms and don’t get pissed off when people ask for a pen because you won’t provide them with one."
Dec 2020,10,So I guess the pandemic is over at United Airlines,"Had no choice but to fly the other day. I guess the pandemic is over at United Airlines. Not only was the plane jam packed, but a significant portion of the passengers took their masks off as soon as they sat down. Maskless people coughing and sneezing left and right and the airline made no effort to measure temperatures or prevent sick passengers from boarding. The economy plus section was mostly empty but passengers in economy weren’t allowed to move up from the cramped economy section even once it was apparent those seats would remain empty. Then, United served drinks and snacks- on a one hour flight. Terrible experience, if you don’t want the plague fly Frontier or Delta."
Dec 2020,50,Fantastic service at United Airlines!!,"Fantastic service at United Airlines!!    In the middle of the worst time of civil aviation I had to cancel my reservation. UA had two canceled flights and the far far away end destination is closed down in the Pacific. So I had to use the special cancelation policy enforced with Corona.    IT WENT SO SMOOTH!!    Call the number on UA webpage - No waiting time at all- I was connect to a booking operator at once. No hassle at all - just extreme polite verification and a refund to better times with a nice ""sorry for lost vacation"".    I will definately be back at United Airlines booking. This is what I call SERVICE!    /Just"
Dec 2020,40,I wish I can see any US carrier up in the top 10. But we still have some ways to go,"Average flight, with average experience. Nothing standing out or superior  Of course money is the name of the game here. You have to pay for everything. Pay for a meal, pay for check-in luggage, pay for entertainment. PAY PAY PAY...  The lounge in EWR if VERY poor compared to the lounges I visited around the world. Continental breakfast EXACTLY like the one you get in Motel 6. Sad.  Leg room on the going trip was Tight, but coming back I was on a upgrade flight (forgot the name) with more leg room. On time most of the time, but the service leaves a lot to be desired...."
Dec 2020,10,Vp,Had to postpone my trip from dec20 to April /21...”corona flexible “  I did not ask for full refund.. I am obligated to accept the difference in fare (be it up or down)...the April/21 is $100 cheaper ...United refused pay the difference of $100 as their term of “flexible “ suggest- United owes me $100 per ticket and train their staff in the Philippines in customer relations
Dec 2020,10,DO NOT FLY UNITED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES,They changed the flight time and won't refund me for it. The very worst airline in the entire busines.
Dec 2020,10,Horrible customer service,"In this flight me and my parent went to the desk before boarding, they were extremely rude. My mom does not speak English very well. I was born in Brazil and my mom has struggled to learn English. She can still speak in a way that you can understand filling in some of the sentences. She has been able to cover herself. The lady and the man in the front table acted like they couldn’t understand her at all. I could hear everything that she said, you could understand. The people working on the desk also told her rudely to wait in the sitting area for five minutes, even though a man came later (in between the five minutes) and helped him. So five minutes later she went and they told her again (rudely) to sit down. And now we are boarding hoping that the service is better."
Dec 2020,40,From IAD to FRA,"Flight: UA989 IAD- FRA    Liked:  Clean Airplane.  The Flight Crew served dinner, as soon as, they could after take-off and then turned down the lights to let people relax/sleep.  My Flight Miles are in my Frequent Flyer Account within a few days after my flight, automatically. I don’t have to chase them down with the airlines.  Didn’t like  We landed in IAD on time and then we waited 10 minutes to disembark. It took the ground crew 10 minutes to get the roll steps in place for disembarkation. By then I only had 30 Minutes and I had to run from Terminal A to Terminal D. If my flight to FRA hadn’t been delayed, I would have never made it. If I was disabled and unable to walk, I would have never made it either. Schedule gave me 49 minutes, in reality, I only 30 minutes to get to my connecting flight and 30 minutes is just too little time.  Games portion of Entertainment Consul/Device would not load. I tried several games and at several different times during the flight. But the games never loaded. Finally, I just gave up.  When will the Airlines standardize the carry-on size, so that what people us as a carry on will fit above the seat? I was forced to give up my carry-on at the gate, while other with bigger duffle and sport bags were allowed to take their carry-on on board the plane. I had especially put in my carry-on a breakable plate and not in my suit case, so I could insure that it did not get broken. I had to remove the plate from my carry-on so it wouldn’t get broken when the ground crew threw it down the chute. I had then to carry the plate on board without any protection and constantly ensure that it did NOT get broken during the flight.  Breakfast was a small hard biscuit and yoghurt. The biscuit is hard and small and I cannot eat Yoghurt; it does NOT agree with my metabolism. So, for Breakfast it was just too little for me.  All in all United Airlines is as good as Delta Airlines and I would fly both again."
Dec 2020,20,United does not practice unity for their customers,"United decided without warning to cancel our return trip after we had already arrived for the week. They offered no other flight other than to fly back the next day or get a partial refund. Since you cant just add another day to your planned trip, we had to cancel and find alternative airline home. They did not give us a fair refund from what we had paid. Of course, finding a one way ticket back home with less than 5 days cost a pretty penny as well. We have yet to hear back from United on how they plan to rectify this problem."
Dec 2020,10,Terrible,"Flight was delayed by hours both ways, never again!!  We where booked a hotel that was far away. And the shuttle took 45 minutes to pick us up!! Horrible!!"
Dec 2020,10,"""Flex Fare"" Hidden Fees and Rude Customer Service","I received unwarranted and appallingly disrespectful confrontation from a Customer Service supervisor and feel compelled to share my experience to help others. Upon replaying the recording I'm sure this individual would be fired. CS Issue: I booked a return flight under Flex Fare, which promises free change fees and only paying the difference in fare when needing to change a flight. Borders remain closed and I am required to postpone my flight. However upon going to change my return, I noticed the fare is $180 more expensive than booking a new one way ticket completely on the identical flight and date. Upon inquiry, United Customer Service informed me there is a 3 month window that honors the ""Flex Fare"" rate, and after the three months the rate increases. I then asked to cancel my return ""Flex Fare"" ticket completely and receive credit, and I was told I am required to pay a $99 cancellation fee. After being sent to a supervisor to calmly and pleasantly discuss my problem, I was accosted by a disrespectful supervisor who, after describing my situation, put multiple words into my mouth including ""illegal"" and ""fraud,"" and told me I need to hire a lawyer to sue his multi billion dollar company. When I assured him that I did not use those words or threats he was accusing me of, and calmly reminded him that I am merely a loyal premier customer and would like assistance to find a solution to my problem, he again rudely snapped at me to hire a lawyer, cut me off from speaking, and all but told me to 'F off.' After receiving such unwarranted disrespectful customer service I will never be flying with this airline nor the Star Alliance entities again."
Dec 2020,20,Not happy,They keep changing the flight times and it is messing with my itinerary. very upset. people need early flight times and they are not accommodating.
Dec 2020,10,Crappy service by United Airlines,One of the reps was rude. I was not greeted when I came in on the airport like she did for other customers. I was ignored when I asked for a seatbelt extension. I submitted a complaint and it said wait 5-10 business days for a response.
Dec 2020,10,Never Again,I made the mistake of thinking United would be similar to Southwest or American Airlines which I use regularly and boy was I wrong. United is without a doubt the worst airline you can choose. They’re the only major airline that doesn’t give Basic Economy a free carry on and on top of that you have to manually check in and wait 30 min for a representative to come over and verify you didn’t have a carry on. The planes feel old and crowded. And to top it off we had an hour delay for some tech issue I’ve never had with any other airline. We were sitting ducks in a hot airplane during COVID no less. Do yourself a favor and never use this airline.
Dec 2020,10,United airlines poor service,"I was very disappointed in United Airlines. First of all there was no social distancing on the plane from Cabo San Lucas to San Francisco. They crammed everyone they possibly could into every seat.  Secondly, instead of having people traveling together sit side by side, they split us up. My husband and I were seated in the same row, him on one side of the plane by a window, me on the other side by a window. When I asked if we could sit together as a mother and daughter wanted to sit together, I was told we had to sit in the seat assigned.  Thirdly, when I asked the stewardess when United quit social distancing on they're flights, her response was ""This fight is booked"" and walked away. She was very surly and down right rude.  Service was non existent starting with checking in for our flight at the airport all the way through the flight. I don't believe I ever saw a smile from any employee of United.  From now on, even if I have to pay more, I will fly any other airline out there. I will no longer fly on the unfriendly United."
Dec 2020,50,Best Customer Service,I had a lot of complications with both connecting flights (that were not United) and United made everything run smoothly. Outstanding customer service from start to finish.
Dec 2020,30,Flight after Thanksgiving...NOT SO GOOD,"Well...had we known we were going to have issues with a return flight on a different airline than the one we flew in on, we would have never booked this ticket. We went north on Alaska and it was a perfectly flawless event. Did not check the ticket carefully and when we were ready to come back home, we were surprised with a ""checked bag fee"". Our class of ticket did not allow for a full size carry-on...what the heck?? Anyway, we will probably not use United again unless we absolutely must!! Lesson learned!!"
Dec 2020,10,Baggage never made it the entire trip!,"My boyfriend and I had planned a short but very special 5-day trip from 11/21-11/26 to celebrate my birthday (our first celebration together) in Bora Bora, French Polynesia. Bora Bora is situated ~1hr flight from PPT (Papeete, Tahiti). We planned to stay at the exclusive Conrad Bora Bora, this is a $3,000/night once-in-a-lifetime experience we are talking about, and we were looking forward to celebrating my birthday with our friends and this was all planned 6 months ago. Also, our first international trip in 2020 during these crazy and uncertain times.    We checked in at the United counter at SFO at 10.05am on 11/21 with two smaller trolly bags:  passenger 1 (Tag issued at 10.13am)  passenger 2 (Tag issued at 10.12am)    Both bags were priority tagged - both bags checked in at the same counter by the same United representative, handled by the same United baggage personal - so what could possibly go wrong one would think!? Unfortunately, my luggage (which was tagged under my boyfriend's name) never showed up at PPT despite having it checked in 2hrs before departure. Moreover, the airports were not crowded at all and despite being a **DIRECT** flight from SFO!    We've spent excess time and energy, international roaming fees to be on calls with the Houston office to deal with a problem that we had no part in, in fact we paid for a service we never got! Moreover, we had to deal with this issue on our own in a country that was shut down due to COVID-19 and we could not even buy the basic things we wanted! But this is not about buying items...this was supposed to be a stress-free, happy occasion for us and we can't understand how a priority tagged bag, checked in 2hrs before departure, on a direct flight does not make it on the flight! This has caused so much anxiety on our short 4 day trip that was supposed to create happy memories for both of us. The customer experience and service has quite frankly been a nightmare to us, and we've had to deal with this on our own. There is so much bureaucracy in the UNITED system and if you call one number, nobody wants to take responsibility or wants to help us out - we've learned first hand that your system is BROKEN. Nobody even knew why the bag did not make it on the plane to begin with! I made multiple calls to figure out where my bag was and there still day 3 into my trip and nobody could provide an answer. Once I got off the long calls with United, you do not magically stop thinking about where the bag is and when we could get it back!! This is wasted vacation time at a daily rate rate of $3,000, which we cannot get back. This is irreplaceable! This may be just another lost luggage in the United statistics, which no one at United cares about, but it's a mistake one that had a huge negative impact on what was supposed to be a fantastic birthday celebration for us and our friends in Bora Bora.    I had no dresses, jewelries, swimsuits, workout clothes and other personal items intended for a big multiple days birthday celebration with our friends at the exclusive Conrad Bora Bora! We are talking literally NO clothes - NO clothes, and given our own concerns about the COVID situation outside it is impossible to find suitable replacements locally, and even if we wanted to venture out in pursuit of those, most local shops are closed due to COVID. I had to buy clothes from street vendors who could not really produce a receipt either.    After 72hrs, on 11/24 we received a call that the bag had been found at SFO and yes of course, it is clear that nobody really put that bag on the flight to begin with! We were offered that the bags be put on a flight on 11/24, only arriving at Bora Bora on 11/25, which we declined as we were returning on 11/26 and we did not want the bag to be lost yet again! As I mentioned above, this is a short trip and Bora Bora is an hour flight from PPT and there were no flights the same day from PPT to Bora Bora that same evening. At this point we just wanted UNITED to no do more damage to our trip than what had already been done and I did not want my bag to make it to Bora Bora when I just left the country. So I came back to SFO and my bag was right there!    UNITED, you've done us WRONG! We have both been faithful UNITED customers for years and this is such a disgrace to your loyal customers. My boyfriend wrote a letter to you as well and we did not hear back at all. I am extremely frustrated with your lack of empathy and ability to compensate me to make this right. And please don't tell us we have to submit receipts for the urgent items that we bought (with most shops closed and us only have to shop at street vendors)...that in total cost $500 with the expenses for the international roaming fees. It has truly been a nightmare...what is the point of paying extra for priority! This is a sad signal you are sending to us that you do not care, and quite frankly this is unacceptable UNITED."
Dec 2020,10,COVID feast.,The fact that they would book airplanes to capacity during a pandemic seems completely unsafe & money hungry. I kids you not I do not see a space open on this flight. This during all time high numbers of covid cases. Never flying with United again.
Dec 2020,30,travel credit alternatives stink,"I had to change my travel plans due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The alternative flights I was provided - after I accepted the travel credit (which wasn't the full amount of my flight) - was very sucky times and dates going through the worst airports at the most inconvenient times. The fact that these are the only options now available to me is just very frustrating and angering. Had I known what the options were beforehand, I would have rather taken my chances with the original flight. It sucks that customer service is so un-customer friendly and very unhelpful. Considering a different airline for future travel. Posting this review so others know ahead of time to beware of all the fine print and deceptive marketing these airlines are using."
Nov 2020,10,Absolutely awful,"I don't even know where to begin. But Rick Castaneda from Chicago Airport needs to be fired as soon as possible. He was very worked up from the moment I came up to the employee and is extremely stubborn and when I asked him to talk to my flight agency after I called them he refused and said no one is going to talk to them and then he writes a bad comment under my name that I got in the wrong flight (I didn't but he doesn't want to hear me out!!) and then leaves. He also told me not to ever book a flight with United Airlines again. He's having a bad day and decides to do that to customers, very selfish of him to do that to the company that pays his bread."
Nov 2020,40,Pet friendly flight,"One of the few airlines that allows snub-nosed dogs in cabin, so I was very glad to be able to fly with my dog. Flight attendants were very friendly and helpful too!"
Nov 2020,10,Scam alert!!,Be prepared to a pay a surprise 35.00 for a small carry on. Fly southwest. They don’t hide random charges!!!
Nov 2020,10,No COVID precautions and no social distancing,"My husband, daughter and I decided to fly for the first time since the pandemic to see family and it was the worst experience ever! No one is social distancing at the United check-in lines! There was a cluster of people at the United check-in kiosk, people were literally shoulder to shoulder. I was trying to scan my ticket from my phone to print out the luggage label and it wouldn't scan. I asked one of the United initial check-in staff to help me, she wanted to touch my phone. When I asked her to help me without touching my phone or if she has wipes she can use to hold my phone with, she said she has no wipes and she couldn't help me and walked away! I kept trying over and over again until it finally worked. The staff was completely confused and flustered which led to there outright rudness. The flight was completely full with not one seat empty. Totally disappointed. I wouldn't recommend for anyone to fly United."
Nov 2020,10,NO MORE UNITED AIRLINES,"I had to purchase a ticket for my family as a Ph.D. student for a conference. Because of Covid, everything canceled and I was not provided a refund but instead credited. When I try to use it no one helped me. If the trip is less than the original one, you lose your money. If it is more expensive you have to pay. As a Ph.D. student who is making 600 bi-weekly, this means I have to purchase two more tickets and lose almost half of what I had already paid (which is around 400dollars) . I had a one-hour conversation but no solution. NO MORE UNITED AIRLINES"
Nov 2020,10,What's the point of Covid-19 Regulations if you don't enforce them,"What a train wreck! I will never fly United again, what a joke. Not only are they packing people onto the plane likes it's a cattle car but they don't even enforce their mask policy. People with their mask not covering their nose, people who have the guts of their mask ripped out so you can see their lips and mouth. What a joke, United should be ashamed and they are definitely should be blamed for the spread of Covid 19 and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Human Beings. What a pathetic company."
Nov 2020,10,No Covid persuasions,"I wanted to bring to the attention of the people that United Airlines is NOT checking passenger temperatures. I boarded the plane from LA to Eugene, then returned from Eugene to LA. NO one checked out temperature or anyone else there or on my return this holiday week. We were up in the air when I noticed the man next to me to the left, vomit, keel over and moan, sweat, moan, throw up. I told the flight attendant and they didn’t even let me move even thought the flight wasn’t full. I told the attendant when we got off the plane and they said there was nothing they could do when a person gets on sick. Then I called the customer Service regarding it and they basically blew me off and told me that I would have to call the CDC and put a complaint in about it in the feedback section online. Then we asked to talk to a supervisor about them not taking temperature and that they wouldn’t let me move away from the sick individual. They basically said they couldn’t do anything about it. Here I have to wear a mask, quarantine, sign an affidavit before boarding the plane about sickness and this guy was let on because they didn’t check. Therefore, I’m coming to the media regarding the fact we all have to be careful everywhere and be 6ft apart, but I have a totally sick individual next to me on the plane and that’s ok? Were on total lockdown and they don’t move this individual on the plane to the back? The fact United just ignored it and no matter who I talked to, they just brushed it off. This is not ok, they need to be checking temperatures there and back."
Nov 2020,10,Extremely disrespectful,"I had just sat down in my seat after rushing to my gate, and quickly put my mask under my nose to get some air. I had a flight attendant yell at me from 5 rows away to put my mask over my nose and that he would not tell me again (threatening to kick me off flight after having mask under nose for no longer than five seconds. Very inappropriate way to speak to a customer when several other people had their masks off to drink water. Unprofessional! Last time I’ll fly United."
Nov 2020,10,No Social distancing precautions,Traveled with my husband for a quick weekend getaway after hearing about how great airlines were dealing with the pandemic. To our surprise both flights to and from were PACKED! I mean every single seat was taken up and I couldn't believe it. I felt so unsafe and you could tell others felt the same. I would find it hard to choose United again due to the lack of blatant incompetence of the infection policy implementation of the pandemic social distancing guidelines. They should be ashamed!
Nov 2020,30,"Not the best airline, but decent","First off, I understand Covid has caused a lot of set backs and travel restrictions. What got me is there is no social distancing. I do notice how the fill the plane at full capacity when in my opinion each row should contain their party not mixed. I understand it's a business, but safety and health come first. The amenities are very minimal, and the service is average. I would not recommend flying at this time, but it was a decent flight. Will I fly with United again, of course, but I wont travel during this unrepresented time."
Nov 2020,10,Absolutely no social distancing,"There are at least 5 EMPTY rows and instead of utilizing all rows, they have customers sitting 3 to a row. I asked to move to an empty row and was told it would count as an upgrade. Instead of moving me, they moves the person sitting next to me. Needless to say I will not be flying United ever again."
Nov 2020,10,Do not use this airline,"Despicably taking advantage of a global meltdown to line their pockets. Health passports are extortion, immoral, evil.  Do not give them a single penny of your money."
Nov 2020,50,Excellent despite the challenges of travel during COVID pandemic,"We had no idea how much would change when we first booked our flight in early March. At the time, our trip to Charleston SC for a May wedding and group birthday celebration seemed like what would be the highlight of the year. However, weeks later travel across the entire country would slam to a halt as a result of the spread of COVID-19. Not dissimilar to other travel sites at that time, the United Airlines website was crushed with travelers trying to cancel their bookings, including us as we continually encountered error or ""come back later"" messages. After several days of trying, we finally were able to cancel the booking online and received credit for a future flight.    Fast forward 7 months later when we felt safer to travel and could use some of our flight credit towards visiting our son at college. Although the United website was easy to book a flight through, it was not easy to apply our credit. So we called United to make the booking and use our credit. The agent was extremely helpful, and she was able to easily apply the credit to our flights and then issue another credit with the remaining balance from our original flight. We later used that remaining credit (booked successfully online this time) towards our rescheduled trip to the Charleston wedding later in the month.    As would be expected throughout all of this uncertain travel time, our original cancellation, and that of another flight we booked and then later canceled in September, were free of charge. United continues to maintain this policy of flexible booking and cancellation.    Despite the challenges of travel during a pandemic, United managed the situation well. We witnessed the cleaning staff and equipment dispatched before our flights. We received free wipes while boarding and upon request. Everyone was compliant with mask wearing. Boarding was orderly and spaced safely. Perhaps the only negative were the full flights with no spacing of seats, although we were given the opportunity to move our flights to ones with less passengers.    Kudos also to the airports that did a great job taking safety precautions to protect travelers: Newark, Charlotte, and Charleston."
Nov 2020,10,Disgraceful,"Will never use an airline that uses coercive tactics i.e. health passports, to enable passengers to fly. Its nothing short of blackmail."
Nov 2020,30,First transatlantic trip since lockdown,"Still learning about our new way of life when it comes to international travel. However, I found the UA personnel to be very patient and genuinely, we are all learning together. Frustrating that Polaris is not reopened but United Club noted we were seated in Polaris and gave us drink vouchers. I do wish United would update website. Their description of at the airport and onboard experience shows all the stuff they discontinued. Look at the website for lounge information. Polaris says ""eligible customers welcome"" and then right below it ""Closed."" No preflight beverage, not even water. Essentially no one at United has much detail what the food would be, other than it is served all at once. Beef or pasta (maybe fish) was as specific and the entirety of the description they could provide when serving.  Perhaps we don't want the Denny's pictures of food concept but examples of real menu items on the website would help. Flight attendants are polite but really no enthusiasm or engagement in the customer experience for meal service; this is actually similar to Pre-Covid unfortunately. They offered a beef (steak), mashed potatoes and spinach with ice cream. It is served sealed in foil so no one knows what it will be. Unfortunate that a lot of food probably gets wasted. Drink service is in plastic cups. Soft drinks in single serve cans. They don't bring the wine to seat so hard to know what is really available. Interesting that I connected to LH regional- food on that 4 hour flight was as good as UA. Served in nice bowls/dishes, glass for drinks, wine poured from the bottles and you can see specifically what it is; standard LH service."
Nov 2020,10,Someone Could Have Died,"My wife and I were flying her sister in from South Dakota. We ourselves have never flown and neither has her sister, but I can guarantee that United Airlines is by far the worst to travel with. Setting up for the flight was easy enough. After about a month our flight was cancelled. Which is understandable due to COVID-19, however we were only offered credit. Absolutely no refund. Which was fine with us because we were going to reschedule her flight anyways. But upon trying to make a new flight anywhere between the website, app, and over the phone we could only find a flight that would cost $200-$400 extra. At that point we asked for a refund and was denied. We went with the cheaper option which still cost us $200. Now on the day of the flight, my sister-in-law managed to get to the in-between airport no problem. The second flight however, ran out of power while they were waiting to take flight. She was already on the plane about ready to take off. She was lucky enough to be on the ground and not in the air. My wife nearly lost her sister, and who knows how many other families would've lost spouses, children, parents or other relatives just trying to spend Thanksgiving with their families. We will never be using United Airlines again."
Nov 2020,40,Always a good trip with United,"Always a good flight with United Airlines. I have been a long time customer, but during the pandemic I have had fly with 5 different airlines because of different segments needed for work. United does better than the majority to combat Covid-19 and still have somewhat of a pleasant trip. They are one of the few who still give water and snacks in a sanitary plastic bag and issue alcohol wipes to wipe down your seating area. The persons here giving negative reviews apparently haven't tried the competition. Keep up the good work United."
Nov 2020,10,DO NOT FLY UNITED- UNSAFE DURING COVID,"DO NOT FLY UNITED if there are other airlines available, take the other airline. It is VERY UNSAFE during COVID. I flew SPIRIT Airlines recently and they made sure that every person was a seat apart because of COVID. United airlines fills up the whole aircraft. There was no social distancing. I was literally touching the person next to me in my seat. I could not believe they did this. Every restaurant, place of business is sacrificing tables and chairs so that people are at least a seat apart. It is very negligent for United airlines to do this. Do not fly unless you want to get COVID. Shame on them for what this company is doing at the expense of the health and safety of their passengers."
Nov 2020,10,I just work here!,"On a Business Class round trip from Fort Lauderdale to Cabo San Lucas on United Airlines. I used AMEX miles to get Biz Class + $. In fact, my wife and I contemplated canceling because of COVID but decided to go anyway because of flight class. On our return flight to FLL, UNITED changed our Biz Class seats and put us mixed us with strangers without notice! It was Nov 21 , the height of COVID. When I complained, the head stewardess, shrugged and said I just work here! Be cautious traveling now and don't fly United. They don't care!"
Nov 2020,10,Are we not in a pandemic?,"I flew Denver to Chicago yesterday and it was one of the most uncomfortable flights I've ever experienced. The flight was delayed, overbooked, and full food service. Every seat was filled... they even offered $500 vouchers because they didn't know what to do with everyone. With everyone eating and taking masks off I was amazingly uncomfortable. It was like we're not even in the middle of a pandemic, I couldn't believe it. How are there no COVID related regulations right now? Seat spacing, mask enforcement, eating protocols... This flight was not safe—for attendants or passengers."
Nov 2020,20,Discriminated,"I’m active duty military, when they called service members to board the flight first, there was a line of men in front of me. She checked them all in, when she got to me and i was about to scan my boarding pass, she blocked it with her hand and said “active duty military?” i said “yes.” she made herself look stupid and muttered a “thank you for your service” to cover up how incredibly rude she was to me. I didn’t see her give any of this treatment to the men in front of me, simply because i’m a relatively small female she judged me off of my looks. Discrimination, this is my first time flying with United and I will never make that mistake again. Very appalled, this has never happened to me when flying with American Airlines or Alaska. If you’re a woman in the military, American Airlines will treat you the best."
Nov 2020,10,Do not recommend,"United airlines should just go bankrupt they are by far the worst airlines I’ve ever booked with. My flight got delayed 4 hours because they failed to check the closing door. God knows what else they didn’t check, I’m extremely disappointed with this experience. I’m extremely upset and hope that I get to my destination before my check in time expires. I literally hate United airlines at this point!!!!"
Nov 2020,10,"Cheat, Lie & Steal","This will be my LAST flight on United Airlines. After being told that I must pay $35 to check a bag THAT I ALREADY PAID FOR I objected as I was told that it “could not be overridden”. Well after holding up the check in line until I “produced a receipt” I was able to find the email proving purchase. Well after the agent could not find another excuse to hassle me she magically overrode the system and accepted my checked bag. The entire time she was rude, abrupt and unaccommodating.    Nasty way of doing business with a customer that has logged hundreds of thousands of air miles with this company over the last 40 years.    Meanwhile, the FOUR agents at American Airlines seemed very pleasant."
Nov 2020,40,Excellent First class flight San Antonio to Dulles,Excellent flight. Left a bit early and arrived early too. Very smooth flight. Decent service with box lunch. No entertainment but seats were comfortable. Fairly crowded but social distancing and masks.
Nov 2020,10,Worst Customer Service/business model,"Our flights were changed 3x on the way to Cabo. Our flight went from 7 hrs to 13+ hrs. The 2nd change had our flight arriving after the next leg left. I was on hold for over an hr to fix this then they changed it again. They wouldn’t even comp our checked bag when asked. On the way home, we had to check our carry on bags cuz the cabin was supposedly full. We found it wasn’t full after getting on the plane. The bags didn’t arrive at our final destination when we did. It was a day later (with our car keys), and they wouldn’t comp a room for us either. They did not take into account COVID restrictions (empty middle seat) as they stated a couple months ago. Don’t fly United if you want a company that cares about its customers. We won’t fly with them again."
Nov 2020,20,Cheaper seats crowded while front of plane is empty,"It resting that United chose to pack the back fo the pack as much as possible but the form of the plan was kept mostly empty. Shows the values of this company, if it matters"
Nov 2020,10,Don’t care about COVID - fly at your own risk,"Fully packed to maximize profit to recover from the down turn. If you are lucky, you get the middle seat. Food and drink are served. Mask is totally optional. If you want to test your vaccines, this airline may be a good place. If you want to be safe, try other airlines that not just enforce the mask but make sure you wear it properly."
Nov 2020,10,Just fly Delta... or pretty much any other airline.,"Please save yourself the aggravation and just choose any other airline. For my flight to Chicago we were first moved to another gate while they gave away our plane to another flight 30 minutes before boarding time. Then the attendant announced that she didn't realize that plane was waiting on maintenance for faulty landing gear... indefinitely. They decided to re-route only those passengers with connecting flights. Not sure what the rest of us were supposed to do. After nearly 2 hours waiting I called United only to be told there wasn't anything they could (or would) do for us. I was told they ""no longer offer customer service"" and could only submit a form with a complaint online. Once I submitted the form, I received an email back saying ""I see you purchased a stock ticket from Delta instead, please contact them."" Say WHAT?!?! You want me to call the company that bailed me out of the predicament you put me in to complain about your total failure? Uh.... sure. So they really mean it when they say they no longer offer customer service - of any kind."
Nov 2020,30,Upgrade to First Class,The only good thing about upgrading was the seat could turn into a lying down position and it was quiet enough to take a nap...
Nov 2020,10,No social distancing or COVID protocols.,"No social distancing, was seated next to two strangers crammed in the middle seat. Both without their masks and eating, and then one of them was sick and coughing. While the flight was quick, the disregard for COVID guidelines makes me not want to fly with United ever again. Letting a blatantly sick man on a flight and not even one space between people to have some peace of mind and comfort?? Give me a break. I felt so unsafe."
Nov 2020,10,No social distancing,They can’t even block the damn middle seat. Had to separate from family and had me sit in the middle with two strangers. I’m not flying again until this pandemic is done.
Nov 2020,10,United Airlines: Redefining Suck,"I had to cancel because of COVID and I'm patient with the delays. Trying to get my refund has been horrible! They won't return my emails. I call and they put me on hold forever but never return. They send me an email survey that asks if I ever got help yes/no. I responded ""no"" and the survey said ""thanks for taking the survey!"" No additional offer for help.    I have always hated this airline but they are cheap so I gamble with my sanity. It's not worth the savings. They just suck."
Nov 2020,10,Wrong info given. Money Grabbing. Dont Care About Customer.,"Horrible experience with United. Will NEVER fly with them again.  Going to Oahu gave us wrong info on covid testing hense we had to cancel our origional flights with Alaska and rebook separate flights because with United because to get a covid test ""the flight had to originate from San Fran in order to do the covid test. Utter rubish!!!  We booked a new flight (lost $300) then checked in and was told no wheel on hand luggage.    Is this the only company that does that?? Iv never experienced no wheel on cabin bag on other airlines. ???? 😏    Asking for help..no chance. ⚠️    Staff dont gives a dam no accountability for anything.    Flight was packed out like sardines, they dont give a dam about social distancing, given our experience we are not surprised.    DONE WITH THIS GREEDY CARLESS CORPORATION!    Looking at the reviews on here it's clear they need to up level.  💩💩💩💩"
Nov 2020,10,Beyond frustrating experience,"Flight was supposed be at 6:15 pm and it was delayed to 9:35 pm that’s 3:30 delay at last minutes notice, very careless and un-empathic crew they jus don’t care so make yourself a favor don’t fly with them if timing and service matters to you."
Nov 2020,10,very poor services,"Very poor service, Dump people works in this company,  Hope this company keep there flight unto date,  who need help, help them, dont Just stand near who does need help,  Very poor services...F**k UNITED Airlines...."
Nov 2020,10,worst airline ever,"Started off with a weather delay. 35 minutes later all good on plane doors such. Then doors open again passenger not doing as asked. They asked her to leave. She would not leave, they asked us to deplane. Started, got to row 20 (i was in 22), told to stop. Reloaded (but lady) got to Houston late missed next flight. Told no hotel it was weather. Many of the other passengers had same issue. We all said no there was a ""customer service issue"" they said no. Accused us of lying. 45 minutes later got hotel room. Next day asked if bag was going to be on plane. Told yes. Got home no bag. Told next flight. No no bag, told next flight, no no bag. Was told the bag (less then 20 pounds) was to heavy for plane. Got bag next day. Told 200 voucher. 10 days later no voucher. Called 45 minutes later, with lots of words back and forth. They say....we will send you one in 5 days. I will let you know if I get. Not holding my breath. Never fly United. This is one of many time used them and had issues. I am done giving them changes. I will pay more money for another airline."
Nov 2020,20,Inconsistent flight experiences,Over the past few years we experience constant delays and rescheduling of flights due to maintenance issues. Very disappointed in this brand in general.
Nov 2020,20,Don't ever travel with your pet!,"Don't travel with your pet on this airline. They will make it extremely difficult, with many forms, and signatures required. No other airline makes it this complicated. I believe this is on purpose, in order to deter people from flying with pets, after the incident they had with a dog on a flight. Be sure to ask what color of ink to fill out the forms with. They might not like the color!"
Nov 2020,10,Worst customer service!,"Worst customer service. When I called to complaint about a switch of my flight that they made, the customer service representative hung up on me, and so did the next representative when I called back. I cancelled the flight because it said that I will get a refund but instead I got a credit. On the website the change of flight said $0 and the United representative try to charge me $200 more, when I said that the website said $0 he said that he has the updated price; when the second representative hung up I went on the website and changed the flight with $0. They are liras. I will never fly with them ever again and I advise to all not to fly with them, they only care about money and not about your well being. I’m surprised they are still in business."
Nov 2020,30,"Staff Extremely Friendly, Flights Completely Full","Due to the pandemic, I was hoping to have some spacing on my flights, but all four segments were sold out with no empty seats at all. So, even in ""Premium"" Economy, every middle seat was occupied. I was surprised at this because I ahd thought they were trying to space patrons out -- but I get it, they have far fewer flights now and need to stay in business.    The fllight crews and gate agents on every flight were extra friendly and attentive, which is a change from pre-COVID, so kudos to them for proving great service."
Nov 2020,10,Worst experience in 20 years,"I have flown United Airlines every year for the past 20 years for my yearly trip to Cancun and have always been happy with this airline until this year. First I booked a direct flight and they changed it to a stop and change planes in Washington DC which took an extra 3 hours of my trip. 2nd I paid extra money to be able to pick my seats and extra money to verify my seats and they had all 5 of my family scattered all over the plane. Then they said they were not booking middle seats due to COVID and the plane didn't have an empty seat on it, no chance of even a little social distancing there. Then on top of all that I was having a bad morning due to all the changes they made to my flight and was feeling nauseous so one of the stewardesses from the front of the plane (I was in the back) was very rude and tried putting me on the do not fly list because I had my mask down for a few minutes so I could breath and lied to a TSA agent and said I refused to wear my mask at all. I will think twice about using this airline again."
Nov 2020,10,United Airlines Not so United,"I didn't use one leg of a round trip ticket due to COVID. When I came to apply the unused portion towards another flight, I was given the run around for 5:30 hours with supervisors today. After being bounced around from one to the other, I realized that not one of them knew the rules. I was told I can use any airlines within the Star Alliance (not true), I can go anywhere in the world (not true), and after all this time trying to find and price the right flight, the last idiot tells me that I have to use the ticket by tomorrow. What?!? I clearly asked weeks ago if I had to book or travel by tomorrow and was told ""just need to book by then"". Clearly, these clowns have no idea what they are doing. No wonder UAL is the laughing stock of the airline industry."
Nov 2020,10,terrible airlines,terrible customer service. They cancelled flights due to covid and they are not refunding just giving voucher. Its 1400$ ticket and the wedding I was to attend and the wedding is cancelled but these folks are holding the money and not refunding. My visa also expired how can i use the voucher? I need a refund! :(
Nov 2020,40,Going to Saint Lucia for vacation,"Our plane was at approximately 50% capacity. Gray seat selection. I also needed wheelchair service and they were prompt, courteous and efficient. The plane was very clean and everyone wore a mask.What I DIDN’t LIKE was United cancelling my original flight and booking it for the next day. That was very inconvenient and almost messed up our trip. I’m going to ask them to reimburse us for an unscheduled overnight stay in Newark. Our first leg of the flight was from Cleveland to Newark. BTW, Newark is NOT one of my favorite airports."
Nov 2020,10,flight sacramento to denver,"worst flight ever been on crying baby in front of me with ear piercing cry no sleep ,stewardess wouldnt do anything to change situation .baby stopped crying the second we landed awful experience never again and paying for a carry on was bogus to."
Nov 2020,10,A NIGHTMARE,"I was supposed to fly to Houston and then to Brazil with my husband yesterday, but due to a malfunction in the plane, the flight was cancelled and I lost my connection to Rio. They then transferred me to a different flight which leaves tonight to São Paulo. However, the connection to Rio is through LATAM. I paid for a 12h flight and it's actually going to be days of travel. They cannot guarantee I'll be able to take my emotional support animal with me from São Paulo to Rio since it's a different airline. Last night a customer service rep from United WALKED OUT on us (I have that on video). After all of this, I've gotten NOTHING to make up for all these facts. I've had huge anxiety attacks since then, my husband's mother is in the hospital and United hasn't shown any interest in helping us. I wanted to at least get moved up to first class, for all the emotional and financial distress they've caused me, and they said that is not doable. I will definitely take legal measures."
Nov 2020,10,Normal guy,"United continues to set the standard for who's worse than Spirit. Getting your money for subpar service. They will force you to check in at the counter, wake you up mid flight for credit card offers, and refuse service during the flight. I mean, why?"
Nov 2020,10,Vacation,"Terrible customer service, they made me check in a backpack and charge me $40 to check my bag even though it was smaller than 90% of everyone else's carry on items. I will never fly United again"
Nov 2020,30,No rules followed..where are the stewards?,"I flew flight 1044 last night from O'Hara to LAX with 3 people across in the row and yes, there we other available seat that only had one person in their row. Delta does a better job of distancing people. 3 separate people never put their laptops and pads away from sitting at the gate til arriving LAX despite being given instructions to do so overhead and stewards never said a word to them even when they made their final walk thru for garbage. No check to see if lapbelts were fastened. The lady behind me talked to her son all the way down the runway and halfway up into air. Surprising how many people think rules do not apply to then but more surprising was how the stewards did not do their job. Not very friendly either. Delta is better!"
Nov 2020,40,Excellent flight Chicago to San Antonio,Easy flight from Chicago airport n first class. Very good service including a box lunch/snack. Flight left on time and arrived early. Smooth boarding and departure. Bags came very quickly. All in all a good experience
Nov 2020,40,Easy flight to Chicago in First Class,"Plane left a little early and arrived early. Smooth flight. Not much attention from flight staff in first class. Just coffee and water. Good social distancing and short walk to our connecting flight, also with united. Easy boarding and departing the aircraft"
Nov 2020,10,United Airlines in Calgary Alberta Canada,Terrible customer service at counter check in. 3 ladies working all on their phones when we arrived at around 1pm this afternoon. No “hello I can help you here” or anything. Speaking to each other in their own language. Extremely rude and not friendly at all especially since it was my daughter’s’ first time flying and out of Canada. I’ve always had wonderful customer service experiences with Westjet and Air Canada. I’m sure if these individuals don’t care about having employment with United Airlines there are many others looking for work right now.
Nov 2020,10,United cattle haulers,"Had first class tickets from Jacksonville FL. To Houston. 1900.00 for two round trip tickets. Got a bottle water(hot)could not offer any other beverages. Attendant said they had no ice onboard. Got water and a cookie. United is the absolute worst airline! Plane was full even in the pandemic! No empty seat , no social distance,terrible service. Long for the days of continental airlines. Stuck with this lousy airline for the simple fact they own destinations out of Houston almost everywhere. As a passenger and customer,your completely taken for granted . Gotta start flying with another airline other than United cattle haulers!!!"
Nov 2020,50,Trip to UTAH,"Flight was mostly full,But everyone was wearing Masks and taking safe precautions.We just went a week ago and they provided plenty of snacks and drinks. Crew was Excellent and me and my wife really had a great experience."
Nov 2020,10,Absolute Garbage,"Would not recommend this airline at all. When I got to my destination, me and 8 other people were waiting at the luggage carousel for 45 minutes before they told us that there was no more luggage and we found out that our luggage was still in New York at our last stop. When I asked if I could wait for my luggage they said no, its too late for them to pick up and that they will deliver by tomorrow morning. Its now in the evening and I still dont have my bag, and the delivery guy said it cant be delivered until tomorrow morning now. Overall, I my luggae is late soon to be 48+ hours, I have no idea how they can leave my stuff at the last stop when there are so few people flying. This airline is trash do not use it!"
Nov 2020,40,Pretty full flight...,"I recently flew from Boston to Chicago with United. While the service crew / attendants were extremely attentive and kind and the check-in process was seamless, the flight itself was pretty packed. Although the flight attendants encouraged social distancing in the aisle, this was nearly impossible come seating time because we were packed in like sardines, sitting directly next to strangers. I wasn't notified that my flight would be fully packed until the day before my departure, so I was not given much time to scheme.    That being said, everyone kept their masks on, service was clean and efficient and I had no other problems with the fight otherwise. But for the extremely covid conscious...might be best to book with another airline."
Nov 2020,10,Worst experience ever,"Worst experience with an airline...    I truly do not wish the ""United airline"" experience on even my worst enemy. Read below and stay clear from them.    I had booked a flight for my parents, to go from Dammam to Phoenix on October 27th, 2020.    They got onto their flight in Dammam without a problem; however, they were denied entry onto their connecting flight by your agents. The reason given was that Canadian citizens transiting through Europe were not allowed into the US. This came as a big surprise to us as the only communication we had from United was that passengers ""Visiting"" the restricted 14 countries would not be allowed into the US. Since they were transiting only through Frankfurt, we believed (as did the airline agents in Dammam) that this restriction would not be applied to them.    Instead of allowing them on the flight that I paid for, they were sent to Toronto. In Toronto, the Air Canada agent (only agent available in the transit area) was not able to help them as this was a United ticket. The agent attempted to contact a United agent to come to assist my parents (if they left the transit area, they would be forced to quarantine in Toronto for 14 days, where they have no one). After waiting for over 3 hours, no United agent showed up to help. At this point, they were forced to book the next flight out to Calgary (where we have family) and pay for the ticket themselves.    During all this, I tried multiple times to call your customer service agents to seek assistance, but they were unable/unwilling to help as the flight from Frankfurt to Toronto was done by Lufthansa and Lufthansa agents wouldn't help because the original ticket was purchased through United and on the United website. The only thing the United agent was able to do was confirm that customers transiting through Europe can enter into the US as long as they never entered any of the 14 restricted countries. And since Saudi Arabia was not among those 14 countries, they should have been allowed on the flight.    The mistake your agent made by not letting them on that flight caused significant monetary and emotional damages. I incurred a cost of $1044.4 CAD & 110.67 USD due to this. The $1044.4 CAD was the cost of tickets we were forced to purchase to go from Toronto to Calgary as your agents just stranded them there, and the $110.67 USD was the hotel charges that I could not cancel and get refunded for. I have all receipts available.    Furthermore, I had the pleasure of spending hours and hours with agents of United, Lufthansa, WestJet and Hampton Inn to request for cancelations/changes to all the remaining trips. To add to all this, I was unable to have my parents with me for a rare family gathering, which was an even bigger disappointment (yes, I am a Canadian citizen as well and was able to magically fly to the US).    I am in utter disbelief at the level of incompetence shown by the agents in Frankfurt, as well as the uselessness of your agents on the phone and in the airport in Toronto.    As a frequent flier of your airline, I will be cancelling my membership and ensuring that none of my family every make the mistake of trusting your airline again."
Nov 2020,10,Me dejaron sin viaje,"Today, November 1, I had a flight with this company to Chile. I had to make a stopover in Houston, USA. When I arrived at the airport today, they told me that I cannot travel because I need a Transit Visa to enter the United States. I applied for the ESTA VISA online several times days ago and did not receive any response. Today the woman at the airport tells me that I had no answer because they are not giving transit visas due to COVID-19 issues. I find it unusual that they sell tickets that cannot be used by their passengers. I need the ticket money to buy a new one and call the company for a refund and they won't give it back to me for 15 days. It's 5:40 p.m. and I called the company at 08:00 a.m. and I still haven't received any notification about my money back. It is disrespectful what they do. I will file a complaint with the National Consumer Service for action on this negligence on the part of UNITED AIRLINE."
Nov 2020,10,Would NOT Reccomend,United Airlines had horrible service and they didn’t even have anywhere to charge a phone or computer.
Oct 2020,10,Horrible first impression,"This was my first time booking a flight with United and my last. I happened to call about the baggage policy to verify that I had to check a carry on size piece of luggage (and yes, you do) when I was told my return flight had been canceled 2 weeks prior to my phone call. No one emailed me, called me or even alerted via the app. My flight was days away and no comparable return flights. I had to cancel my trip altogether. They did, however issue a full refund of my ticket price. The likelihood of me ever booking another flight with United is very slim to none."
Oct 2020,10,Awful experience.,"Well, overvall the service on United is terrible, either costumer service or in flight service it always seems that they are doing you a favor.    I am a frequent flyer on United, but by far my last flight from IAH to GRU was the worse experience. My orinal fligh on 21st of October was cancelled after 4 hours delay d/t maintenance issues, and transfer to next day 12:45. The cancel management was awful, unprepared crew to deal with all demands, lack of communication, confusion and caos. Next day, after a lot of waiting, confusion and delay, our flight was cancelled again and merged with the 20:00 flight, as my original flight was not full, and the next was nor as well. I stayed in the airport waiting for news about my conection, but the way it was handled was absolutely unacceptable for a company as UNITED.    Anyway, after an absurd situation and 24+ hour delay, I was on my way to Brazil in a FULL flight, what make me wonder that the COVID protocol for united is only when it is convenient."
Oct 2020,20,Airline not following COVID health safety protocols,"Employees are courteous, helpful. Pilot keeps passengers informed. Email alerts regarding updates good, yet I didn’t get an email alert as their web page asserts they will do re my cancelled flight. Had to change flight day and time and pay an extra day’s hotel stay. A passenger seated in front of me was asked if it was ok for another passenger to sit next to him. He said ok. I wasn’t asked. Worst of all, United’s website’s shows plane interior with social distancing, but flights to and from Denver were full. Drinks were served, masks off, exposure likely. My daughter had the same experience with American Airlines. Is flying worth risk? Not for our family. Cancelled Thanksgiving flight plans."
Oct 2020,10,JustFly.com & United Airlines cancellation policy due re: fathers death,"My Advice. Don't use a 3rd party company to book your flight! I had to cancel a flight on United to visit my son because my father passed away 5 days after I book my ticket. It cost $75 just to cancel & that only gets you a ""credit"" which I was told could only be used for the same destination within 1 year. So the following year I re-booked my flight & was charged an ADDITIONAL $299 ""re-booking"" fee. When I objected the Just Fly Rep (who was going by a script & was hard to understand because the call center was somewhere in India or Pakistan) told me it was United Airline policy & not their policy. So now my original $571 ticket was now at $945! In order not to lose my original $571, I went ahead & booked my flight. At this point the story gets tragic. My other son suddenly became Ill & passed away and because I could not deal with these people again I just took the loss and vowed never to use Just Fly or United Airlines again."
Oct 2020,20,"Flight Attendants were amazing, United Customer service TERRIBLE!","We had our first class tickets for a wedding in Hawaii for over a year. Trying to get to Hawaii during Covid19 was hard enough but imagine when you are checking in to board the plane you hear a call to the ""service desk"". Once at the desk you are told that you are no longer in first class but economy due to Covid. So in first class everyone was seated except the last row of 4 stating it was due to Covid?    Then told sitting in economy but since bumped they would get the same treatment as first class. Guess what NO WAY. No drinks no food nothing! Didn't seem to care at all. Customer service was no help and didn't seem to care that they changed something we had been looking forward to for over a year.    Also on the way back the United Check In desk person told us to use the kiosk to get our boarding passes. As we were traveling with older handicapped person and explained they did not know how to use the kiosk the United Person rolled her eyes and huffed at us and said I suppose I can help you.    All in all our vacation was wonderful, however, getting there and back was the worse experience I had ever. How does first class run out of entrees when they know how many seats they have???    All in all I do not recommend United Airlines"
Oct 2020,10,United Airlines,"My husband and I have had, by far, the worst flying experience of our lives with this airline. Its like all the employees, including the pilots, have never been taught how to be organized. Customer service sucks and we have wasted a huge chunk of our lives with delays with this crappy airline."
Oct 2020,10,Customer Service is Terrible,"My flight was canceled and replaced with a cheaper flight with no notification sent to me. I found this out at the last second as I got to the airport. I called customer service and requested to speak to a supervisor for a refund on the ticket. He informed me that my refund request may be denied on their refund website while giving me the most attitude I have had in a few years from any business. I have worked multiple customer service jobs and my current career as an IT is still customer service, and I am tired of being the customer and speaking more nicely to the workers than they speak to me. I will never fly United again."
Oct 2020,40,MUCH improved,Clean and comfortable from check-in to baggage claim.  Seats were more comfortable than most.  Good flight attendants and crew.
Oct 2020,40,Very pleasant journey,"We had a very pleasant trip with this airline. The seats were slightly bigger than economy with a little more legroom, which was appreciated. The seat was comfy and staff were polite. A good experience, overall."
Oct 2020,10,Absolutely Not,"If you ever come across this review, please don’t take this airline. The hours and days I’ve wasted on cancelled United flights could easily be vacations worth. I’m currently writing this after my FOURTH PLANE has either been cancelled or delayed. I was supposed to be home 2 f***ing days ago. Jesus Christ I rather drive"
Oct 2020,10,No communication,"My flight from RKS to Denver was delayed due to weather, which I know they have control over. They delayed the flight by 8 hours and we were told we could leave the secure area since RKS is a very small airport and we had no access to food or drinks. So I left the airport to go get food and planned on coming back closer to the updated flight time. Upon my return I discovered that the delayed flight had left without me 3 hours early. I received no written communication through the United app or my cell phone that the delay had been reduced. I know there were other people on my flight who had the same issue. This resulted in me being stuck for another 24 hours until I could get on another flight. I missed 2 days of work because of their failure to notify me of the correct departure time. It cause me a lot of issues that could have been avoided."
Oct 2020,10,Horrible Covid Domestic Cross Country Service United Airlines. fly Delta instead,"Ridiculous service, website and costs for seat change and carry on bag had to pay for.I have a standard carry-on size 14 x 22 x 9. When I try to check in online it says I have to be greeted by a person and they have to see my bag. Everything I looked at said this is the United carry on size. Of course you know they’re going to tell me that it’s too big. I had flown Delta the same distance and they didn’t charge me at all for changing my seat. Easily fit above the seats in the overhead compartments. When you’re Checking in online it looks like that size is a carry-on and it also looks like they’re not gonna charge you. The website shows they charge an upgrade fee for United plus but it looks free. But we have to put in your credit card for them to even let you check in. Then youget all the way to the end after.they have already charged your card only to find out that you can’t check in until you get to the terminal. Using united.com website Is the one mismanaged rip off after another. Do not fly United. I will only fly Delta from now on.I don’t know if this is just rip off for Covid, because I buy United and Delta or not and never have notice United to be so deceptive and costly. So just to be safe I would only fly Delta cross country from now on"
Oct 2020,10,Kids were seated away from parents,"United Airlines did not follow ""The Families Flying Together Act"" to seat families with children together. Our two kids (all under age of 13) were assigned seats apart from father and mother. We arrived the airport early and expressed our concerns to the gate agent before borading and were told nothing they could do about it. We expressed the same concern on the airplane to the flight attendant and she did not try to help. When asked who would help our kids in case of emergency, the flight attendant replied ""Well I don't know but whoever sit next to your kids may help"".    In addition, the flight was fully booked with no social distancing policy enforced in flight."
Oct 2020,10,Irresponsible Staff,"PLEASE PLEASE BE MINDFUL ABOUT advocating PROPER USE of PPE’s .DON’T take this PANDEMIC so lightly. THE STAFF in this flight from ORLANDO TO SAN FRANCISCO last Friday, (10/23) was so RECKLESS and IRRESPONSIBLE. It’s their responsibility to advocate passengers to wear masks on the plane. Their responsibility is NOT just to announce wearing masks BUT to make sure everyone on the flight is following the proper use. They (flight attendant) didn’t bother to remind couple of passengers WALKING in the plane, GOING to the lavatory, with NO MASKS at all.NEVER EVER AGAIN I’m FLYING this airline again. If other AIRLINES are strict enough in WEARING MASKS, I”M SURE ENOUGH UNITED AIRLINES can do the same. AND IT MUST START FROM THE STAFF/FLIGHT ATTENDANTS. If passengers needed to fly, they must follow what’s mandated... USE THE MASKS PROPERLY!!!"
Oct 2020,10,United Robbers!!! Thief airlines!!!,"Booked a trip from LA to Toronto. United cancelled my flight. They didn’t bother to rebook my flight, offer any suggestions for another flight. Didn’t want to work with me. Difficult to reach. Got put into voicemail hell in endless loops.    Eventually, I had to book another flight with another airline. United refused to give me my money back even though they provided no service to me.    “Good news” they said because I get credit to my next flight...why would I try to book on an inept airline that is only interested in taking my money without providing a service.    Service 0/10  Value 0/10"
Oct 2020,10,Insensitivity during Covid,I am utterly disappointed by United Airlines. PLEASE CHANGE YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL CENTER PROVIDER! I had a flight from Bos to SF which had free reschedule due to Covid and when I tried to change the flight. United only gave me credit points even though they early promised to give a cash refund. The points unfairly jacked up the price when the actual ticket price was much cheaper
Oct 2020,10,DO OR EVER USE THIS AIRLINE,"I will never fly United again. Have been using them for years and they have been steadily getting worse. Customer service is terrible, ,legroom keeps gettin smaller, etc. I had recently booked a non stop flight to Boston where I would be renting a car to drive to the Woods Hole ferry to board the ferry on my reserved time. I had to cancel the flight due to health reasons and when getting online to cancel the flight, I noticed that United had changed the non stop flight to one which stopped in Newark with a 3 hour layover before completing the flight to Boston. They never notified me of this change and I not only would have been unable to get to the ferry for my reserved time, I would not have been able to make the last ferry of the day.  NEVER FLY UNITED!"
Oct 2020,10,Who does this to people???,"I’m not one to write reviews even if they were a crappy service. But I’m going on a trip to visit my boyfriend that i havent seen in 5 months, he turns 20 and he always had sad birthdays in the past. I wanted to see him to make it better at the least. Everything was fine until baggage claim. My baggage was broken into (which i understood BUT) my lock was missing, my luggage was a quarter way open and when i open it, horror to my eyes as my stuff is SOAKING WET. The cake mix of his favorite type i spent a WHOLE MONTH searching for to make specially for him was SOAKED. Thank god the contents were packaged but who does this to people??? My tiny boxes of hygiene products were crushed. Like you guys don’t even know the lengths of what I’ve been through to do this for him. Him and I both work long everyday hours and this is the one chance I get to be with him!! And I hate planes in general!!! This is the worst flight I have ever had. Never again will I fly United."
Oct 2020,50,Absolutely the greatest crew - Chicago to Tucson 10/13,"Cannot remember when last we flew with such a tremendous crew. Starting with the Gate Agent, and up to the Captain, it was joy to be around these people. Each one of them had such a refreshing sense of humor, and such an upbeat attitude. All showed appreciation of us, the passengers.    We were in First Class, and among the passengers was a severely disabled woman. Her daughter was with her, but they needed more help. Anything that would take us one minute to do, it took them five minutes. The FC cabin attendant was especially patient, helpful, and courteous. In fact, the entire crew was aware of the situation, and tried to make it as easy as possible for these two to travel. Very commendable.    We had our snacks, we drank our wine (son-in-law was picking us up, so no worries there), we departed and arrived on time. We had left Harrisburg at breakfast, and we arrived in Tucson for lunch. This, truly was a memorable trip. It's the crew that made it so."
Oct 2020,50,Excellent early morning flight,"We had a 7 am flight from Harrisburg to Chicago, and everything went very smoothly. Walked over from the Hotel, checked in, and were delighted to learn that we would again be flying in a CRJ550 aircraft, which has so much leg room. During the flight, snack packs were handed out. They consisted of bottled water, pretzels and a Biscoff cookie. This early in the morning, we needed our coffee, and a most delicious cup of illy was poured for us. We had ourselves a so called ""continental"" breakfast, drinking coffee and eating the cookie.    The sole flight attendant was attentive to everyone, and, really, this flight was very comfortable."
Oct 2020,50,Love united! Best entertainment system,Love flying united. New planes and lots of movies and shows on demand (Bring your own device). They offer the best fares and have great service. The planes are really new and pleasant to fly.
Oct 2020,10,Worst airline possible,"Last year United left my carryon at the gate after I voluntarily checked it.Should have learned my lesson never to fly the Unfriendly Skies. Now I am in a middle seat and they forced me to check my carryon for $35. A d the flight attendant was saying that my HEPA ventilator mask was not allowed. She wanted me to substitute a simple surgical mask for one that’s more powerful than N95 and PM2.5 put together. Kindly educate your staff, United. Never again!"
Oct 2020,40,Care of Customers,"Returning home from Denver, our flight started to take off, then slowed down as pilots asked everyone to remain seated. That was a little startling, but pilot assured all was ok, but there was an issue with the computers(I think) so after waiting on runway awhile, we went back to the gate, were taken off the plane, and flight was rescheduled for the next morning on a different plane. United did make sure the flight the next morning was on time and they reimbursed everyone for the overnight stay. That was appreciated, and also keeping us safe."
Oct 2020,20,Still no mask enforcement!,"While boarding my flight, I asked the head flight attendant if they would be policing the cabin to make sure people wear masks and are wearing them correctly. ""Absolutely"" was her response. I was the first five rows boarding. By the time I reached the back of the plane, I observed an attendant conversing with a maskless customer for over one minute, not two feet from her face. Nothing was said to her. I approached the attendant and asked her if we're supposed to wear masks. ""Of course"" was her reply. I asked her why she didn't correct the lady she was just talking to without a mask . She actually asked me, ""What woman?"" When I told her which woman, she did tell her to put a mask on. I feel United's policy is to let passengers fight among themselves instead of enforcing their mask policy."
Oct 2020,20,No real enforcement of mask wearing.,"During boarding, the man in front of me was not wearing a mask. Flight attendants walked by him five times without saying anything to him! Just before the cabin door closed I confronted the attendant at the back of the plane. She seemed befuddled, then asked what row. She told him he had to wear a mask. Too which he replied, ""They don't do anything"". A few minutes later, he was removed from the plane. The man across the aisle from me had his nose exposed the entire flight. Nothing was said to him. I guess their policy is to let passengers fight among themselves instead of enforcing their ""mask policy""."
Oct 2020,10,United Airlines is HORRIBLE!!!,"This is my first time flying United and it has been a horrible experience!! My initial flight leaving Jacksonville October 8th 2020 they could not find my reservation and I had to take a flight the next day, which is ridiculous since I live an hour away from the airport. Finally got to my final destination the following day 10-9-2020. I called and extended my stay until today 10-19-2020 in which started off ok but once I arrived in Denver my flights all changed????? Now I'm stuck in the airport not arriving home until 10:53pm which is ridiculous once again. Oh and my bags I was told most likely will not be in Jacksonville when I arrive....ARE YOU KIDDING????? This has been the ABSOLUTE WORSE flying experience in my life. Not 1 screw up but both coming and going!!!! Confirmation #AMMNJV  GREATLY DISAPPOINTED WITH UNITED AIRLINES!!!"
Oct 2020,20,Scary Covid 19 Experience,"The flight would have been fine in regular times but it was a very scary experience during covid. The flight was packed. They had rules but did nothing to enforce them with passenger that did not abide. They sent me a text the morning of the flight that it would be ""fairly full"" with an option to reschedule. Really, the day of, when I'm sure they knew for days. I flew another airline to my destination that made sue the passengers were safely distanced and was totally surprised with United's lack of concern."
Oct 2020,30,Social distancing not possible at crowded terminal,Flights were on time but completely full. On one segment of the trip the plane was six seats wide which left me sitting elbow-to-elbow with a stranger for 2 plus hours. At O'Hare airport there were several full flights departing within minutes of each other from adjacent gates at one crowded corner of the airport. I do not see how passengers are expected to maintain social distance in these conditions. See photo. At least at the end of the flights the crew made a serious effort to get people to deplane by rows when called by the crew.
Oct 2020,10,Super Spreader Event on a Plane!,"I can't believe there is no attempt to social distance during a pandemic!! Every single seat was full, packed shoulder to shoulder from security all the way through a 5 hr flight. Completely irresponsible and careless. Not to mention $135 to check a 52 lb regular size suitcase.. 2 lbs over the $35 check in fee cost me an extra $100.. this airline should be ashamed of themselves for putting money ahead of the safety of their own customers.. they give you the ""option to change flights for free if the flight is full"" but I didnt see an open option for at least a full week after my scheduled flight, which is as far as I looked.. i will be utterly shocked if I didnt catch COVID just now.. its almost impossible that I didnt with as much contact as I received from 100s of people from the moment I stepped into the security line.. absolute b.s... bring a hazmat suit if you dont want to catch the rona.. screw you United for not taking better precautions to protect your customers and staff. This b.s will never go away with idiotic practices like this going on BEFORE theres a vaccine.."
Oct 2020,20,Never had an on-time flight,"I've given United a try fairly regularly over the years. I have honestly never had a trip where at least one connecting flight didn't experience delays (from 1 hour to several, usually throwing the rest of the trip into disarray).    With the commonality of delays (with a minority of them being due to weather, and the majority issues on their end with scheduling, etc.), United's customer service has been stoic and unhelpful in trying to remedy issues.    Apart from timing, their service in-flight is fair, and (although fairly last-minute) their communication regarding delays and flight updates is helpful.    I would recommend United if you're not in a hurry. Plan an extra day if you can."
Oct 2020,10,Fraud,"We had a friend coming to stay with us. She missed her connection in Denver. It was her fault not the airline. We found a last minute flight through United but missed the time limited to get the ticket online. The online sales closed 60 minutes before the flight. The counter at the airport said they couldn’t sell tickets and we needed to call customer service. I’ve never heard that they can’t sell tickets before as they make changes all the time for people. We got online and found a customer service number and got a ticket for $75. The counter printed the boarding pass and she flew to Seattle. When getting off the plane I’m Seattle they stopped our friend and said we didn’t pay for the ticket. The held her hostage until we paid $233. After inquiring over the phone the next day the lady said this should have never happened. I was speaking to the same lady’s I bought the ticket from. She said it may take up to five days to get the refund. Something wasn’t right. I looked up another number for United and called a different rep. This lady informed me the ticket I bought for $75 was fraud. I had called a fraud number. They sell tickets, then when she was on the flight they canceled the ticket and kept my money. The part that bothers me the most is United won’t take any responsibility. I know I fell for fraud but they allow this person or company or travel agent to buy a ticket last minute where the general public can’t. They have to have some special access to buy tickets last minute. United counter had printed the boarding pass. I feel they should be responsible to some degree not just say well sorry that happened to you. They are responsible to whom they give access to their system. The lady told me it’s happening all the time and she’s seen people loose thousands."
Oct 2020,10,Do Not Fly United Airlines - Absolute Crooks,"Rant against United Airlines - I highly suggest that you DO NOT FLY WITH UNITED AIRLINES. I have nothing good to say about this airline. Absolute SCUM airline!    So I was flying out to South Dakota from Atlanta this morning for a 7 day hunt. My luggage consisted of my Lakewood double bow case and an average sized suitcase. For a 7 day hunt it was difficult to pack all of the necessities in 2 pieces of luggage. Especially considering the 20 degree temps that we will be hunting in which means extra layers.    The bow case loaded with 2 bows, lots of equipment and other items weighed 49 pounds. The suitcase weighed 58 pound. I knew I would have to pay a penalty for the few extra pounds. Not a problem - I was willing to pay a feasible amount. Until this SCUM airline told me I had to pay $150 extra!!!!! They are price gouging customers every day! My baggage total price came to $230! I will drag this luggage all the way back to Georgia before giving them my money again. It is more about principal than money. The story gets worse. Then they are late! Due to their late arrival in Atlanta they caused me to miss my connecting flight in Denver Colorado. So now I have a 6 hour layover which totally ruins my plans. Where's my compensation for their delinquency???    It would not surprise me a bit if my expensive baggage does not even make it to it's destination!    Here's the kicker - I checked their profit margins for 2019. They made 1 billion dollars in profit! The article stated 'Cheaper jet fuel and slightly higher fares helped United Airlines boost third-quarter profit 23% to $1 billion'.    Even with that massive amount of profit they feel the selfish corrupt need to price gouge customers for something ridiculous like being just a few pounds over on their luggage. United airlines is a SCUM airline that will take advantage of you as a customer yet can't even get you to your destination on time!    So I need to apologize in advance to my social media friends. Because you will be seeing multiple posts about this scum airline from me for the next few years or until they make their wrong right."
Oct 2020,50,Honest review,"I recently traveled from Florida to New York with United airlines and I was impressed. I had traveled with them before and thought their flights were okay but this time I was very satisfied. I was hesitant about traveling because of the pandemic but United airlines was very accommodating and followed all the safety protocols. Before entering the plane individuals were asked to board by seat number, this allowed for a more organized procedure and people were not gathered in huge crowds waiting to board.  Flight attendants greeted you with individually wrapped alcohol wipes when entering the plane and everyone was asked to keep their mask on the entirety of the flight. Flight attendants were vigilant and asked passenger nicely to keep masks on. One thing that was reassuring was that although the flight was full the airline would let you know before that it is just in case you want to chance your itinerary to another flight.  Additionally, snacks were handed out in an individual bag which included a crackers, water, pretzels and alcohol wipes. Flight attendant also went around handing out refreshments at no extra cost which was really nice. When we arrived at our destination once again the individuals were asked to exit the plane by seat number which allowed for a smoother exit and avoided huge crowds.  Once again, I was very impressed with this airline and how pleasant my flight experience was with them. I would recommended traveling with them."
Oct 2020,50,Great Service,"Just completed a flight from Houston to Detroit on United Airlines. The flight itself was a little rocky with the turbulence but the customer service was great. During this COVID time you worry about how close the next passenger is but I noticed the center seats were mostly empty throughout the cabin. There was still beverage service and they passed out prepared little bags with complimentary bottles of water, cookies and pretzels (minimal contact). I thought it was a great idea and actual quicker. The staff was pleasant, answered questions and there were tv and movies available via the app. Good flight, great service."
Oct 2020,10,Awful experience,"It was time to celebrate Juliens first birthday since his exit into heaven. We had a great trip despite the emotional toll it was taking on my boyfriend. It was to be his sons 27th birthday and so happened to mark nine months in heaven that same weekend. Regardless of the difficulty, the trip up was a good one but unfortunately I couldn’t say the same to be true for our return flight which is why I’m writing this.    We flew United back to Jacksonville by taking two flights. I’ve never flown United before but our coming fight on JetBlue was so wonderful it had definitely set the stage for our fight back.    I’d like to start off by saying we were not allowed to bring on our carryons, so we paid the $35 per bag fee and began our journey. We quickly realized many were bringing on carryons with no tags to distinguish who were allowed to bring them on and who weren’t. There was no one at the gate to take the carryons not allowed and pay the crazy fees they stated would happen of not checking them in. Hm, wish we would have ok own they don’t follow their own rules and others as well.    We boarded our flight from Boston to D.C. and it was packed with every seat being filled. We were separated along with another couple in the same row so we kindly exchanged seats, connected to the WiFi and enjoyed a nice movie provided by the airline. They offered something to drink but no snacks like JetBlue. No big deal as we brought our own.    When we arrived at the D.C. airport, the place was packed with no social distancing at all. It was a bit shocking but we continued on to our next fight maintaining social distancing as best as one could.    Boarding was quick and easy but once again, no fees at the door for the carryons. Now we were regretting wasting $70. Once we boarded, we noticed we were both at the window seats opposite of one another in the same row. My boyfriend asked about sitting together. The fight attendant Fallon told us no we could not as the seats had to remain empty. I thought she was being funny and playing around with us at first but we soon found out that was not the case. He asked her if it was an FFC thing and she got an attitude saying we were not allowed to sit together because of social distancing requirements. This was confusing as every single seat was filled except our row and the one in front of us.    My boyfriend then says that United sucked and that what she was saying was B.S. that it was because of social distancing. At this point I was just so confused as to why the lady was being so rude as I had never experienced a flight attendant like that before. I greatly respect flight attendants as they have to deal with some really rude and I’m sure crazy people but to be in a career where you have to be rude tells me they have missed their calling in life. She then sarcastically and in a snotty voice says, “you two can survive sitting a part for an hour.” I looked at her, no longer able to continue biting my tongue and say “that was really rude for you to say.” She then says, “what you said was rude.” I asked her what it was I said because I didn’t say anything and she then pointed at my boyfriend saying he said it was B.S. I told her she was in customer service and the way she was talking to us was not ok. From there she began threatening to get someone to take us elsewhere so we could sit together.    Feeling that this lady just didn’t like us from the get go, probably because we are an interracial couple, I pulled my phone out to record just to protect us as it felt like she just wanted to assert her authority and get us kicked off. I only turned it off because my boyfriend just wanted to get home.    Next thing I know someone comes onto the plane asking if we wanted to sit together. We both said no. I told the person we had no problem sitting a part, it was the rudeness of the flight attendant that we had an issue with. She kept asking if we wanted to sit together making it sound like they could sit us together, again we responded no, we are fine and the lady said one more time, you two can sit together and when I shook my head no she proceeded to let us know we could fly out tomorrow on another flight so we could sit together. We both let her know once again we had no problem sitting apart and that was the end of the conversation.    During the flight many came and sat on the arm of my chair while waiting to use the restroom. So much for social distancing!    In all my years of flying, I had never encountered a single attendant that was anything but happy, friendly, smiling (even under a mask), and making the flight a very enjoyable experience. It’s sad that this had to happen during a difficult time of sorrow and emotional draining to encounter a first like this. Such is life I guess. Regardless, I will never pay a single penny to United again. I’ll stick with JetBlue, Delta and even Frontier from here on out."
Oct 2020,10,Time changed with no notification,"The airlines changed the time for the flight with no notification like call, message and email. I was on my way to the airport when noticed the time had changed for my flight - are they in their mind to do that right before the flight?"
Oct 2020,10,"Upcharges you for using ""future flight credit""","I bought a ticket back in August for my mother to visit her new grandson, but after some change of plans, we decided to postpone the trip. So we cancelled the trip and got ""future flight credit"" for a future trip.    Now, we're trying to book a flight for Thanksgiving. However, we see that we're being charged an additional $150 for our flights when we try to book via the credits. If we just pay for the flight upfront it's $200 total, but if we pay with the credit it's $350 total. We would have ended up paying more for our flights even after the credit was used if we decided to use their credit system.    And this is a side note, but they also don't allow you to pay for flights with miles and cash. You have to only use miles or only use cash/credit.    This whole experience has been frustrating, stressful, and downright terrible for me and my wife. Felt like United was just trying to scam us left and right to make a quick profit.    Don't trust them. Don't give them your money. They'll just try to squeeze more out of you and pretend like it's your own error."
Oct 2020,10,Worst First Class Experience,"Paid much more for a First Class ticket only to be given a little bigger seat, a disinfectant wipe (no warm wash cloth), a cracker and a cookie. Such a scam and a joke of inferior service. Never again.Check-in ticket counter employees were incredibly rude and lack customer service skills."
Oct 2020,10,Terrible Customer Service,"Today, my mom and I traveled on flight UA613 from LAX to IAD. Over the course of our five hour flight, the flight attendant made several rude comments to my mom as well as some other passengers around us. One particular time, I was in the restroom and my mom asked for a “covid snack bag” for me (since I was gone) and the flight attendant responded with, “do you see her here?”    Incredibly unprofessional, rude, and snarky. I did not appreciate the service and do not plan to fly with them again."
Oct 2020,10,married in Las Vegas 10-10-20,Horrible flight attendant very nasty for no reason it’s not right the worst part of the whole trip was United. What happened to United thy used to be a great airlines not no more. We are in the middle of a pandemic and your not allowed to sit with your family instead the whole plane I noticed separate all the families why??? There is a more chance to spread the virus like that right? This doesn’t make sense! Flight attendant embarrassed me in front of my wife and kid cause I didn’t move my seat up for the take off and we didn’t even leave the terminal yet I had a long day and was tired but all that being said all she had to do was be respectful to me very simple! I’m done with United!!!
Oct 2020,10,abusive covid policies!!,"we all know of all the studies which show that little kids are not dose who spreads the virus! but this stupid airline requires from all kids over 2 years to wear a mask! these little kids don't understand why it's important to wear a face cover, and they continue trying to pull off their masks every 2 minutes.  I was on a night flight, and my kids between the ages of 3 & 4 tried to sleep but with this mask on their face - which is almost covering their eyes, it was impossible!!!  and the staff was so not nice to me & my kids! one lady was at my seat every 2 minutes to scream at me why the masks are not covering their nose!!!  what do you expect from dose little kids? This is torture!!!  Besides the point: this lady was acting so hateful only to me! I'm Jewish, and it was so obvious that this is just about hating jews! someone - an adult, one seat behind me continued to take off his mask, and this same lady was so nice to him, joking with him about wearing a mask!!!  this lady told the captain that I'm not complying with their policies, and on my way home they made me problems flying with them!  DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINE, AND HAVE A NICE TRIP!"
Oct 2020,10,Worst customer service,My mother who was 65 years of age was traveling all the way from India to Charlotte. She did not know English. The ground staff of United airlines were really rude to her. My mother had to use wheelchair and the person who were pushing the wheelchair was really really horrible she demanded for high tip and she was disrespectful with my mother. She forcefully took my mother's phone to dial my number to ask for more tip. She was walking really slow just so that my mother could miss her flight. Later she made her reached the gate 5 min before the flight was suppose to take off and still she wouldn't let her enter the flight as she grabbed my mother's mobile to call me to demand for more tip. She was angrily talking to my mother for bringing a 50lb bag all the way from India without knowing English. What a horrible lady.The airport authority should not entertain such behavior and staffs just because someone does not know English. Horrible horrible experience.
Oct 2020,10,Horribe,"absolutely horrible. PACKED 737, they rescheduled, cancelled or delayed going and coming back so seats were reassigned. with every seat taken. No meals, no temperature taken, nothing. Then have the audacity to talk about social distancing when we land. We changed planes in Denver with a 39 minute layover and had to from terminal C to terminal B. Ever been to Denver airport? It's a haul. The entire trip was just a horror show. I will never, ever fly United again. EVER."
Oct 2020,20,COVID GUIDELINES VIA UAL: RECKLESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE!,Reckless and Irresponsible! LAS to EWR was near full today--But good news! It seems no one can contract Covid on United because in Economy we were packed like sardines without regard to a Worldwide Pandemic. It was as though this pandemic hadn't happened as we were all twisted like pretzels (as usual) for 4.5 hours in a warm cabin. Nothing was different including the middle seat Economy class nightmare.It was horrifying. If restaurants and buses and everyone else is placing space between people WHY ISN'T UNITED? You MUST as a company balance your need to stay alive your PASSENGERS need to stay alive.
Oct 2020,10,Horrible flight and customer care during pandemic,"If there was an option to leave a zero I would!!! No consideration for customers. They overbooked a flight during a pandemic!!!!! No care for everyone on that flight. Delayed for over 7 hours and ruined my entire trip, had the decency to only reimburse $50 for two people...the amount of money wasted was over $ $1,000. Horrible experience. JetBlue all the way!!!"
Oct 2020,10,Worst flight of my life !,"Had a horrible experience with United flight!!! Our flight was delayed over 7 hours... also the flight was overbooked and did not follow any social distance regulations at all!!! There were barely empty seats. I was sitting next to a person I didn’t even know and was not part of my party. Absolutely ridiculous, a whole day of my vacation was ruined!!!!"
Oct 2020,40,March 11 - UA2110 Washington/Dulles to Phoenix 737-900ER (#3452) FC Seats 4E & F,"March 11 - UA2110 Washington/Dulles to Phoenix 737-900ER (#3452) FC Seats 4E & F    On Wednesday, March 11, we flew United Airlines flight UA2110 from Washington/Dulles (IAD) to Phoenix (PHX) in First Class, seats 4E & F, on a 737-900ER (#3452).    We had arrived at IAD with plenty of time to spare, and were quickly through TSA Security, so headed to the United Club on the C Concourse, to await our boarding.    We boarded on-time at Gate C-17, before Group 1, due to our status, and were seated and squared away, before most passengers had entered the jetway. Our two briefcases were stored – wife’s in the overhead, and mine below the seat in front of me. As the 737-900 has a nice closet, my jacket and my overcoat were hung, instead of being folded up, and stuffed into an overhead bin..    Our 737-900ER was one of the planes from the Continental side of the fleet, with DirectTV. The positive is that the DirectTV on this plane performed perfectly, which was nice, as there was zero to see out of the window in the dark. The negative is that the DirectTV equipment does take up underseat storage, but we had all that we needed. Also, with DirectTV, the safety demo is fed through that, and we noticed that it was still the “Star Wars” themed safety video - and that the tie-in to the newest release, was featured on the napkins.    This 737-900ER was also one of the older ships, with smaller overhead bins, and without the “Dreamliner” lighting, but it was still in good shape.    One thing, which surprised me was that this flight was only about 2/3 full, with lots of E and E+ seats available. Usually, flights to Phoenix at this time of the year, are flying almost always 100% full, but not this one. Now, the FC cabin had checked in full, and there was a long waitlist for FC upgrades, but probably many of those empty E+ seats had been occupied by high-status flyers, and their upgrades came days before? Still, odd to see so many empty seats on a flight into Phoenix, and especially at this time of the year.    Since we had done Champagne at the United Club, we moved to the red wine, the Indaba Mosaic Red Blend, which has been a fairly recent addition to the UA wine list.    On this evening flight, we had options for dinner, and ordered one of each - to split/share:  A Cheeseburger on a Pretzel Roll, which for being reheated at 30,000 feet, was really pretty tasty, and especially so, since it was not cooked over a flame. The other was a Pumpkin-stuffed Ravioli dish with Broccolini, that was also tasty. We had a Baby Spinach Salad, and then a Crumb Cake for dessert. Actually, all better than some recent domestic FC meals on United.    The clouds were building, and looking ominous at IAD, so I was glad that we were getting out, when we were. We ascended into a heavy haze, and then into clouds and darkness. I was glad that the DirectTV was working, and that we had that to watch, as there was nothing to see outside of my window..    Our Cabin Crew was great, and lots of fun on this 5 hour flight. We had flown with our Purser twice before, and surprisingly, she remembered us, and even the flights we were on with her. The Gate Agents at IAD had been very good, as well.    We arrived on-time, at Gate E-5, in the newly renovated T3 at PHX, at 7:40pm, and our luggage was quickly up down in Baggage Claim. We were heading home.    Little did we know at the time of this flight, that it would be our last one, for many months. At that time, we had 28 flights booked on United, for most of 2020. How travel, and our world would change, we could never have imagined. Though not related to this March flight, I have to say that United was excellent with those booked flights (many international), and with one 30 min. call (including a short hold-time), all were credited. Excellent job in some very bad times, and greatly appreciated."
Oct 2020,40,March 10 - UA316 Phoenix to Washington/Dulles A320 (#4269) FC Seats 3A & B,"March 10 - UA316 Phoenix to Washington/Dulles A320 (#4269) FC Seats 3A & B    On Tuesday, March 10, we flew UA316 from Phoenix (PHX) to Washington/Dulles (IAD), in First Class, on an A320 (#4269), in seats 3A & B, so on the port side of the plane, and at the rear of the 3-row First Class section.    We were flying out of the newly reopened T3 at Phoenix PHX, and this was the fourth time for us, since United moved their operations there in mid-Feb. We are finally getting the hang of T3, and the E Gates there. On each visit, more is being opened on the E Concourse, and the restaurant/retail scheme is starting to take shape, but still a lot of construction. With the closure of the older T2, where UA was based, there is not yet a United Club in T3, but now there is at least a sign, indicating that it is coming soon. However, looking at that area, between Gates 3 and 6, I saw no work, yet.    Our departure gate was E-3, moved from E-7. To date, we have flown out of E-5 once, and E-3 three times - never from E-7 - yet.    We boarded on-time, and were quickly into our seats, with our jackets hanging on the bulkhead hangers, just a row behind us. This flight was completely full, with all passengers checked in, which has been typical of the early morning flights to Washington/Dulles lately.    This A320 had the updated FC seats, which I now believe have been installed in all UA Airbus planes. In FC, there is a podium, between the 2-2 configured seats, with small drink trays, several storage areas (not for use in takeoff, or landing), and AC/USB and earphone plugs. This podium has nice marble tops, and one extends for more space. The seats are comfortable, with both good width, and ample legroom (39"" Pitch and 20.5"" Width), and their recline is quite nice, plus as the rear reclines, the seat cushion slides forward, so these intrude much less on those behind a reclined seat - they take a little getting used to, as one needs to slide their hips forward, to recline. Even though we were in the last row of FC, with the recline of these seats, there are no restrictions, such as one has on the 737's, in the last row. The A320 has 3 rows of 2-2 in FC, and though the overhead bins are adequate, the first one and a half on the starboard side of the plane are filled with safety gear, however there was plenty of room for my wife’s small, wheeled briefcase, and then my regular briefcase and hat fit below Row 1 seats, along with my wife’s purse. We like Row 2 because of the foot room, and the underseat storage. On a couple of recent flights, we were in Row 1, up at the bulkhead, and missed that storage space. Row 3 is fine, except that some angles of view are obstructed by the wing, and engine cowling. Row 1? Only when Rows 2, or 3 are not available. Also, the window alignment is good in Row 3.    We had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) streamed to our devices via the United App, and did use this free service on this flight. I was glad to have the PDE, since we were in/above clouds quickly, all of the way to IAD - nothing to see out of my window. There was on-board WiFi, for a fee, but again, we did not use it.    Once seated, we had two glasses of the Cuvée Jean Louis Charles de Fère Blanc de Blanc Champagne. This was a new wine on United, and I was surprised to see a Champagne as the sparkling wine selection, after years of Proseccos, and similar sparklers. Really a nice Champagne, and on a morning domestic 4 hr flight too. We liked it so much, that we continued with it, for breakfast, as well.    We departed on-time, in a light rain, but the clouds were breaking. Morning rain is uncommon in Phoenix. However, we were soon into the clouds, or above them, with zero to see, until we started our approach to IAD. By our final approach, the clouds had broken nicely, and it was a lovely, cool afternoon at Dulles. Usually, we do a big circle at IAD, approaching from the Southwest, then turning North, then East and finally past IAD, approach from almost due East. We did our final approach from the West this time, which is atypical. With the clearing weather, I was looking forward to the big circle, but not this day.    As this was the “breakfast flight,” we had two choices:  United’s version of an “Egg McMuffin” on a croissant-type roll, with Ham. This was actually quite tasty, and especially with the pepper sauce provided. It came with a fruit cup, which was just OK, as United insists on using cantaloupe that tastes like firm plastic. This cantaloupe was no different.    Or, Cold Oatmeal with mango and coconut, and also with a fruit cup, but a better one - no cantaloupe! The Oatmeal is actually better than it sounds, and we have both had it on several early flights on United.    Both came with Fruit Yogurt, and a choice of bread. My wife chose the Yeast Roll, and I the Croissant, and both were pretty good for being at 30,000 feet.    We continued with the Champagne.    We landed 5 minutes early, and parked at Gate D8, which is at the far end of the concourse. Our luggage came out onto Carousel 4, in a timely fashion, which is not usual at IAD, where we normally wait for 20 minutes, even after having taken the train, or the mobile lounges from the C-D Concourse.    Our Gate Agents at PHX were very good, and it seems that they were learning their new “home” in T3. Our Cabin Crew was great, and made the flight fun - as much fun as one can have on an early morning flight, more than half-way across the country. Now, I did miss watching the countryside go past me below, but then we DID have Champagne on a domestic flight, so that made up for it.    We were met at Baggage Claim by our driver, and after negotiating the construction in the parking area, were off into Washington, for my wife’s first meeting. In all, a very nice flight."
Oct 2020,50,Great flight staff,"Used this airline to go to New York for the week in December, we were very surprised by the flight and the airline staff could'nt do enough for you and the food was good for the 8 hour flight. we had seen some bad reviews online but we have to say well done United Airline."
Oct 2020,40,March 05 - UA1870 Tampa to Houston 737-800W (#3296) FC Seats 1A & B,"March 05 - UA1870 Tampa to Houston 737-800W (#3296) FC Seats 1A & B    On Thursday, March 05, we flew United Airlines UA1870 from Tampa (TPA) to Houston (IAH) on a 737-800W (#3296) in First Class, seats 1A & B. This was the first leg of our trip home to Phoenix, after several days of meetings for my wife in St Petersburg.    As this was a fairly early flight, we left our hotel a bit earlier, than we usually would, especially as we did not know traffic from St Petersburg to Tampa Airport, and also did not know that airport. Well, we had plenty of time, so had breakfast at Ducky’s, near our departure gate, A6.    This flight was only about 2/3 full, with even 1 FC seat (across the aisle from us) available, plus quite a few E+ seats. The waitlist was rather short, so I think that all stand-by passengers got on, plus a few flyers with status, likely got upgraded too.    We walked over to Gate A6, and boarded on-time. We were in our seats quickly, with all of our carry-on luggage stowed in the overhead bins, as we were at the bulkhead - not our favorite seats, but this was a business trip, that got moved from Chicago to St Petersburg, rather late. This 737-900 was an older plane, and from the Continental side of the merged fleet. It had the smaller overhead bins, and DirectTV. The monitors for the DirectTV are small, and mounted on the forward bulkhead, so not really all that good. The same size monitors are closer in the other rows, as they are in the seatback. That bulkhead also takes up foot space, though for the B (and E seats - no C, or D in First Class), there is a small cutout, but not for the A and F seats. The tray tables are in the armrests, so these seats are slightly more narrow, though not by much.    We took off on-time, into heavy clouds, so the DirectTV was appreciated, as there was nothing to see from my window.    We declined the pre-departure beverage service, as well as the in-flight passed snack basket.    Immediately on takeoff, we were into heavy clouds, and did not break out, until our final approach to IAH. Even below the clouds, it was an ugly day - but no weather to affect our connecting flight home to Phoenix.    We arrived 15 mins early, so had just a bit more time to make that connection. The cabin crew was very good, as had been the gate agents at TPA."
Oct 2020,10,Terrible flight in both directions,"On a flight just before the Pandemic set in, I travelled from SFO to Chicago to visit family. I used miles to upgrade to First to give myself a treat. The check in staff were rude, the first class staff were rude and the plane was dirty, the floor covered with trash. The food was the worst: some cold pasta with tomato sauce. On my return trip, my flights were cancelled and rescheduled THREE times and I spent hours at O'Hare trying to reschedule with NO HELP from the airport staff at United. ""You have to go stand in line at the other gate"" they told me, smirking. This is first class? Never again!  Nobody smiled. These people appear to hate their jobs. Sad."

This was the first leg of our flights PHX-IAH-TPA, for meetings for my wife in St Petersburg.    This was the third time we had flown out of the recently reopened T3 at PHX. We were there, in February, when United had just moved their operations over to the new terminal - and just days before. Then, nothing was yet open on the E Concourse, and we had to walk over to the F Concourse, where Delta had been in operation for many months. The next time, we were running a bit late, but noticed that work was commencing on the restaurants and shops on the E Concourse. This was also our third flight to/through Houston’s IAH, in less than three weeks. We were starting to get to know the E Concourse, and T3, but still missed the older, more intimate T2, where we seemed to have practically lived for the last 18 years. Still, T3 is lovely, and soon the E Concourse will be built out, including the new United Club, which is just getting started.    We boarded on-time, and were in our seats, with a glass of ginger ale, and a coffee for my wife - even for us, too early for wine. Our seats were in the rear of First Class, and on the port side of the plane. On the A319/320 ships, the is against the forward bulkhead. I think that the A320 has a bit more room to that bulkhead, than does the A319. On that latter ship, I found the foot room rather cramped, but not so on this plane. I would have thought that they were identical. My wife, at 5'-1"" had plenty of legroom, and mine was not bad. I still prefer rows 2, or 3, but this trip was added fairly late - actually moved from Chicago to St Petersburg, FL.    This A320 had the updated FC seats, which I now believe have been installed in all UA Airbus ships now. In FC, there is a podium, between the 2-2 configured seats, with small drink trays, several storage areas (not for use in takeoff, or landing), and AC/USB and earphone plugs. The podium has nice marble tops. The seats are comfortable, with both good width, and ample legroom, and their recline is quite nice, plus as the rear reclines, the seat cushion slides forward, so these intrude much less on those behind a reclined seat - they take a little getting used to, as one needs to slide their hips forward, to recline. Now, the A320 only has 3 rows of FC, and though the overhead bins are adequate, the first one and a half on the starboard side of the plane are filled with safety gear, however my wife’s small wheeled briefcase fit nicely above us, and then my regular briefcase and hat fit in one of the bins, with less safety equipment. As there is no underseat storage with Row 1, it pays to board early.    This ship had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) streamed to our devices via the United App, and we both used it. There was on-board WiFi, for a fee, but again, we did not use it.    We took off with some haze and high clouds, flew into more clouds, and had those all of the way into Houston, where we landed to overcast skies, and haze.    In-flight, I moved to the Guenoc Sauvignon Blanc, but my wife stuck to coffee. We had a “breakfast snack,” which was United Airline’s version of an Egg McMuffin, with a scrambled egg and Canadian bacon, on a nice, flaky bun, rather like a croissant - not at all bad.  The flight was relatively smooth into Houston, but there was nothing to see, because of the heavy clouds.    This flight was virtually full, with only a couple of E+ seats available. Then, there were 8 folk, who were on the stand-by list, so some did not make it. For a bit, we were on a lot of less than full flights out of PHX, but lately, most were going out full.    The cabin crew was great, as had been the gate agents at PHX. During the flight, the Captain came into the cabin, and gave out his business card. He profusely thanked us for being Global Services, which was a very nice gesture. Now, where was our Global Services rep, when we almost missed our connection at IAH, due to a late arrival? At least in that case, the rep did come on board, before we departed, and said that she was glad we made it - well, I was still gasping of breath from the run and SkyTrain ride, so might not have seemed as appreciative, as I was with the Captain’s thank you. We landed on-time, at Gate C-12. We were moved from C-4, which was going to be so convenient to connect to TPA, out of Gate C-5, and besides, our IAH-TPA flight was then moved to C-41! Oh well, just like Chicago ORD, United gates at IAH are quite dynamic, and change often.    We had a good flight, and feel that we are starting to get the hang of the new operations at PHX T3. Now, just get the United Club finished, please."
Oct 2020,40,March 02 - UA1768 Houston to Tampa A319 (#4012) FC Seats 3A & B,"March 02 - UA1768 Houston to Tampa A319 (#4012) FC Seats 3A & B    On Monday, March 02, we flew United Airlines UA1768, from Houston (IAH) to Tampa (TPA) in First Class, Seats 3A & B on an A319 (#4012). We were originally in seats 1A & B, but when checking the UA App, I noticed that 3A & B had become available, and chose to move, as we do not like Row 1 against the forward bulkhead. This was the final leg of our PHX-IAH-TPA flights for a business meeting in St Petersburg, for my wife.    We had time for a glass of wine at H Burger, on the C Concourse at Houston, and then walked to our gate, C41, moved from C5.    We boarded ahead of Group 1, due to our status, and were in our seats, with two glasses of the Ca’ Di Rajo Mitō sparking wine. Takeoff was held up for about 15 mins., waiting for 3 people connecting to it, so we were a bit late in leaving.    Our seats were in the rear of First Class (Version 2), and on the port side of the plane. On the A319/320 ships, the last row of FC (Row 3 on the A320) is against a bulkhead, and there are clothes hangers. As this was just behind me, I had my, and my wife’s jackets hanging. We settled in, for the relatively short flight up to Tampa/St Petersburg.    This A319 had the updated FC seats, which I now believe have been installed in all UA Airbus ships now. In FC, there is a podium, between the 2-2 configured seats, with small drink trays, several storage areas (not for use in takeoff, or landing), and AC/USB and earphone plugs. The podium has nice marble tops. The seats are quite comfortable, with both good width, and ample legroom, and their recline is quite nice, even in the back row, plus as the rear reclines, the seat cushion slides forward, so these intrude much less on those behind a reclined seat - they take a little getting used to, as one needs to slide their hips forward, to recline. Now, the Version 2 A319 only has 3 rows of FC, and though the overhead bins are adequate, the first one and a half on the starboard side of the plane are filled with safety gear, however my wife’s small wheeled briefcase fit nicely, and then my regular briefcase and hat fit below Row 2 seats, along with my wife’s purse.    Our plane had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) streamed to our devices via the United App, but I did not use this free service on this short flight. My wife did watch something on her iPhone, and said that the connection was very good. There was on-board WiFi, for a fee, but again, we did not use it.    We took off with some haze and high clouds, flew into more clouds. Unfortunately, there was nothing (but clouds) to see, until our final into TPA, and then had broken clouds and haze.    In-flight, I moved to the Gravelly Ford CA Chardonnay, and passed on the Guenoc Sauvignon Blanc. I was surprised that they had two white wines, plus I got to sample a new red - the Indaba Mosaic Red Blend from South Africa - not bad.    The flight was relatively smooth until our final approach, and then we picked up bumps over the Gulf of Mexico, but nothing bad.    We arrived at TPA 15 mins. early (even with the late departure), and had our luggage, before heading to the hotel hosting my wife’s meetings in St Petersburg, across the causeway.    The Gate Agents at IAH were very good, which is not always the case, and our Cabin Crew was excellent."
Oct 2020,40,March 05 - UA1859 Houston to Phoenix 737-900ER (#3409) FC Seats 5A & B,"March 05 - UA1859 Houston to Phoenix 737-900ER (#3409) FC Seats 5A & B    On Thursday, March 05, we flew United Airlines UA1859 from Houston (IAH) to Phoenix (PHX) on a 737-900ER (#3409) in First Class, seats 5A & B, so the last row of FC. This was the final leg of our business trip in St Petersburg, FL, and was taking us home, so that we could repack and fly to Washington, DC in a few days.    We originally had a pretty tight connection, so had not planned on anything at IAH. We did arrive a bit early, but used that to walk from Gate C-11 to C-39 (changed from E-3 so no concourse change). As with all of our flights on this trip, this ship was from the sCO side of the fleet, with DirectTV.    This 737-900 had 5 rows in First Class, in a 2-2 configuration. The FC seats are 21"" wide, with a 38"" pitch, which provides plenty of legroom, even with the DirectTV equipment. While the FC seats are fine, and fairly comfortable, we have grown fond of the FC seats in the Airbus A-319/320's, which were refurbished about 5 years ago, across the fleet.    Now, normally we would not choose Row 5, but the business meetings were changed from Chicago to St Petersburg, FL, very late, so we took what we could. On one of our flights, we were able to get out of Row 1, but there was only one available FC seat on this flight, and it was 1A. These seats have no recline, and are also just in front of the lavatory in E/E+, but as this is a relatively short flight, at 2:43 hrs, we took what we could get. This plane was also one of the older 737-900's, with the smaller overhead bins, but as we boarded before Group 1, there was no issue with our limited carry-ons fitting. My small briefcase fit (tightly, due to the DirectTV equipment) under Row 4, and my wife’s small, wheeled briefcase fit overhead. Our jackets were hung in the small closet, across from the galley. Also, and atypically for our recent United flights, this plane had lots of empty seats (including that one in FC). The waitlist was fairly short, so I think that everyone made it on the flight, and several likely got upgraded too.    We took off on-time, with haze and heavy clouds - just the weather we had landed in. Soon, we were up into those clouds, all of the way to final approach into PHX - though we had heavy haze there. I was glad to have the DirectTV, which functioned perfectly for the entire flight.    We had a “dinner snack,” with a choice of a Thai-style Veggie Wrap, or the standard issue Cheese, Fruit and Cold Cuts, which my wife chose. That was a wise move, as the only thing remotely “Thai” about my veggie wrap, was an overly sweet dipping sauce. Poor choice on my part. Once, the meals in First Class, between Phoenix and Houston, were quite good. As this was the sixth time that we flew this route, one direction, or the other, in a 3 week period, we were getting tired of the “snacks.” Oh well, we had gotten breakfast at the Tampa Airport, so were not all that hungry, and besides, we were headed home to good food, and great wines. We had the Guenoc Sauvignon Blanc on this flight.    On approach, after breaking out of the clouds, we headed out over Glendale, before turning for our approach from the West, so did a nice fly-by of downtown, and the new terminus for the SkyTrain, at the auto rental facility - still under construction. We arrived at Gate E-3 in Terminal 3, where we had flown out of, just a few days before - and a few days before that, and then a few days before that. We had first experienced the United operations in T3, a couple of weeks (and flights) before, and had gotten the hang of it. Our luggage was out quickly, and it was finally time to get home - do laundry, and repack for the next trip.    A nice flight (though food could certainly have been better), with an excellent crew. Even the gate agents at IAH had been nice and friendly, which has not always been the case at that airport."
Oct 2020,40,Chicago to Harrisburg 10/1/2020,"I don’t remember if we have ever flown in a CRJ550 aircraft, but this was pure luxury. We have never been inside such a spotless, gleaming plane, and have never been so comfortably seated. So much leg space, it felt like our living room. Everything smelled fresh and new. If all aircraft were like this, we would, definitely, fly more often. We were seated in the third row in First Class.    The one low point is that we were supposed to receive a snack. It was so stated on our tickets. So, we had coffee and shared a breakfast pastry in Chicago, and had planned on this snack to keep away hunger pains until we went to our daughter’s for dinner. One hour into this two hour trip nothing was happening. So, we flagged down the flight attendant, and she told us that no food had been delivered to this flight. Not even one tiny bag of pretzels. Wonder what the excuse for that was (if any)?    So, I pulled out some stale breadsticks, and we ate those."
Oct 2020,10,United continues to fly FULL flights during COVID,"I am so glad this is my LAST flight on United. Do not trust this airline during the COVID outbreak. I had a bad experience last month on United in First Class and this time in Economy it was even worse! United continues to pack their planes FULL without any consideration for its customers. I was informed my flight was full and I could try to choose another option if I was worried about a full flight. I went online to see what my options were and I received a message ""No other flights to Orlando today"". What is the use of informing you of an option when no options exists?!!    I got to the Dulles airport 2 hours in advance and decided to use my One-Time Club pass for the United Club. Dulles has 4 United Clubs, but only one was open at the time. I went into the Club and I was informed that they were not taking One-Time passes due to COVID and were saving their spots for travelers that had a full annual membership. So you purchase a One-Time Pass and you cannot use it?!! Another customer service failure!!!    Finally, United states it is doing several things to ""keep you safe"", but it really is just a PR stunt. Besides overcrowding the flights, when it was time to deplane, United did not completely follow its practice of deplaning by specific row numbers when it got to the back of the plane. While the rows 20-26 rows were deplaning, the flight attendant announces all passengers could deplane. This resulted in an ADDITIONAL 12 rows trying to deplane when rows 20-26 were still in progress! Being in the back of the plane further increases your risks.    If you are worried about flying during COVID, be especially careful is you choose United. You are taking your health into your own hands as United is doing little to ensure a safe flight. I recommend choosing another airline until a COVID vaccine is available and widely circulated before boarding another United flight."
Oct 2020,40,Directtv full of commercials!!,"I prefer the entertainment options that they had before. Directtv is just full of ads, just like at home! Totally aggravating!  Selection of shows isn’t nearly as good as it was before they went to DTV!"
Oct 2020,10,Skyler,Please do yourself a favor and use another airline. Booked a flight “no longer in existence” through website. Messed up entire experience. Customer service is useless. No response to my email. You’d imagine during these times everyone would be on their A game with less passangers to attend to. Hygiene=bad. Experience=bad. Service=bad. Professionalism=real bad
Oct 2020,10,Horrify Airport Experience because of United,"When I first arrived to the San Diego airport at the United booth, the woman who first helped me was very rude, the gentleman that took over was much more helpful. I had to change my flight to fly out Sunday the 27th, instead of the original ticket on the 28th. I was told I had to pay $195 to make the change, even though I continuously receive emails of how United has a no change fee. I also received TWO emails stating ""your flight is fairly fuyll, you can change your flight AT NO COST"". I paid for the new ticket, but was embarrassingly denied going through security 3 times in a row because ""no ticket matched my license"". Eventually, the United Employee from the ticket booth walked over to convince security to allow me through. After this upsetting ordeal, we board the plane and have to sit on the tarmac for 40 minutes while they fixed the plane problems"
Oct 2020,30,"Not the best, but not the worst....","Did have to go home once (flew this airline multiple times), and because the weather was bad.. Interesting part is: Delta and some other premium airlines were still flying, while United decided to call it quits.. oh well."
Oct 2020,10,Flight attendants don’t enforce mask wearing,"Just flew from Houston to Denver and could see two different people from my seat who took their masks off after takeoff and left them off for the entire 2.5 hour flight - I could see these two and I can’t imagine how many more on the flight were also not wearing masks! Both the men I could see were on the aisle (as was I) and multiple flight attendants could see them mask-less multiple times. I wanted to believe that with the precautions airlines are claiming to follow then flying could at least be as safe as possible during COVID, but lax enforcement means that as a consumer we are being put at unnecessary risk."
Oct 2020,10,ALWAYS SOMETHING BAD W UNITED,"United is either late, cancelled or loses a bag. 5 out of the last 6 flights one of the above has happened. Horrible airline. Don’t book if you want to get there and want your luggage IF you do."
Oct 2020,30,Ngo social distancing,"It was my fourth flight during the ""pandemic era"", first time on United Airlines plane.  I was hoping that plane will not be full. It was wishful thinking.  Even changing plans by one day didn't help. Tuesday was the same as Friday or Sunday.  The only ""new"" thing I've discovered was a small bag with bottle of water, cookie and pretzels, given to us by the crew. During my earlier flights in July, there was nothing served.  Flight was smooth and on time. What else you may need?  In Chicago, we didn't need to walk a lot, the plane has stopped by the closest gate to the baggage claim.  It was nice flight, even with the masks on.    RomanP"
Oct 2020,10,Denver to Chicago 9/30/2020 flight First Class,"We were not happy with the service here. Although, First Class was completely separated from coach in this B757, they still boarded beginning with the back rows. Due to back problems, my husband cannot stand In place for a long time, so we sat down in the waiting area. Finally, they called the first rows, and we were among the last to board.    When, we got to our seats (3E and 3F), someone was sitting in the window seat. Not only that, but he was not wearing a mask, as he was eating cake, drinking a drink, and reading a book, while his belongings were scattered all over the other seat. I said, “ Excuse me” several times, and he just ignored me. A flight attendant was standing at the front of the cabin (3 rows up), and I turned to her. Instead of coming over immediately, she yelled out (over the other people in the aisle, who were settling in), “What is the problem?”    Finally, she came over, and demanded to see our boarding passes. Then, she asked to see the boarding pass of the person, who was sitting in our seat. He was buckled in, and with all the stuff he had, he couldn’t find it. People were backed up behind us, and, it was obvious that she was annoyed with us for causing this commotion. So, her solution was for us to take the two aisle seats (and sit next to total strangers), rather than move that passenger out of our seat. We refused, and she became even more irritated, as it was getting very close to flight time, and she wanted everyone seated.    Well, the man did move. He left cake crumbs everywhere, and had touched all surfaces in our seating area.    When the airline stresses that everything has been cleaned and disinfected for the next passenger, they should make sure it is the correct passenger who will sit there."
Oct 2020,10,Please read this important,They refused for us to board because of documents They keep up that they say we need. they made us miss our grandmother’s funeral even when it was an emergency and even refuse to refund us if I could put 0 stars on this airline they would also refuse to refund us our money I wouldn’t revoke this airline to anyone  Especially with the rude staff in Atlanta worst airline ever don’t fly with United
Oct 2020,40,Very nice flight from Tucson to Denver on 9/30/2020,"We had been VERY hesitant about flying anywhere now, however the urge to visit family overpowered us, and, after reading many, many reviews, we felt reassured that proper precautions are being taken, and we could fly safely.    This regional flight is on a smaller aircraft, and we were aware of it. So, I took my much smaller carry-on, which still does not fit into the overhead bin, but will go nicely under the seat in front. Boarding began with the back rows, and we had, always, felt that that was a logical, and good idea, as those people can settle in, while the front seated passengers are boarding. We were seated in the third row, so we were in the last group to board.    The plane, as usual, was very clean, and the windows sparkled. However, we have, always, thought that these planes were much cleaner than the regular United ones. The one flight attendant had her hands full, as all the seats were occupied. She did her job cheerfully and efficiently. The coffee was really good.    Packaged disinfectant wipes were handed out as we boarded, and everybody wore masks. All seats were Economy, so legroom was at a minimum, on this two hour flight.    When we arrived at the airport, we were told that the plane would be delayed for 30 minutes, as a crew member had called in sick. Then, for some unexplained reason (no planes taking off, or landing), we had to sit on the tarmac another 20 minutes, or so. We had lots of time in Denver to make our connection. Obviously, many others didn’t. It was announced that deplaning would begin with the front rows, however, as soon as the plane stopped, a surge of travelers came running from the back, very concerned about not making their connecting flight. As we had lots of time, we just sat there, and were the last to leave."
Oct 2020,10,WORST EXPERIENCE,After a long international flight my wife connection flight was UA1989 and upon late arrival the baggage was not there. went to the agent to claim the baggage and it was locked but was able to see my baggage. the agent absconded from work and so we need to come home. Today spoke with customer service and they are not able to reach the agent. how much more difficult is for the public to reach?? DONT FLY UNITED AIRLINES PERIOD.
Oct 2020,50,Why all the bad reviews?,"Last week I flew United to Phoenix from Cleveland. This was my first time flying since COVID-19 started. Everyone followed the mask rule and there were no issues there. The flight attendants were present and friendly. They did do a single drink service. They also gave us a bag (upon boarding) with a cookie, pretzels, water, and an antibacterial wipe. The flights were smooth and on time.  For those concerned about social distancing, I would not recommend this airline. My flights were both almost completely full. The middle seats were also occupied. I’m not too concerned about getting Covid, so i didn’t really mind all that much. They did not take our temperatures at the airport or to board The aircraft. I guess it could be potentially dangerous for those at risk of complications from contracting the illness.  But i saw so many horrid reviews, and thought I’d share my perfectly fine experience."
Oct 2020,10,Bought direct flight they now have me flying all over the country and didn't reimburse a dime.,I searched for a direct flight from jax to denver for a meeting. I was expect to leave at 8:15 & arrive at 10:15ish Denver time. I now am flying from jax to Chicago and then Denver. Double the travel time. I only chose united because of the direct flight they offered me no rebate or anything for my inconvenience. Let this be your reason not to fly united. They don't care about there paying customers.
Sep 2020,10,Non-Existent and Angry Cabin Crew,"Yikes, pretty bad flight. COVID issues aside with lack of food service, but I saw the cabin crew twice the entire flight. One of the times I asked for a stroopwaffle they gave out, and skipped over me, and the flight attendant angrily told me she would have to go all the way to the back to get it. Umm...it’s a plane, thankfully she didn’t have to journey too far. If you hate your job, time to retire."
Sep 2020,10,Do not fly United until covid pandemic is over... they don't care about you so maybe never again,United does not block off middle seat so you are shoulder to shoulder and in breathing distance of a stranger. Plane was fully booked and felt very uncomfortable. They give you an option to change the flight for free but its not even the same day... disappointed about their lack of care about their customers... will be er fly with them again because of this
Sep 2020,10,Not Covid safe,This flight is packed on a Wednesday night. All seats filled- NO SOCIAL distancing at all. I was appalled when I boarded but I had no alternative choice. This is patently un-safe and unacceptable. I will not fly this airline ever again.
Sep 2020,20,Beware Covid-19 Policies: Some Crews Don't Enforce Mask Policy,"While my overall flight experience was okay, I was horrified that two first-class passengers were able to go the whole flight without a mask. The flight attendants engaged with them multiple times, walked past them to collect garbage, and even let them deplane sans mask! Also, just FYI: upgrading to premium economy no longer comes with complementary wine/beer--a waste of money. I was told this was to limit credit card/machine interaction (which makes sense, more germs), but in premium economy, you don't have to pay for beverages anyway...    United DID listen to my concern but only when I tweeted a photo of the first-class passengers without masks. They offered me a small credit, but in reality, I just wish they would reassure me that mask-wearing will be enforced on ALL flights in ALL tiers."
Sep 2020,10,The worst airline ever is the united,"The worst airline ever is the united airline customer service. Even If this airline was free, never take it. I've never seen such bad customer service like that before. They're lazy, disrespectful, careless, and so so very rude!!"
Sep 2020,10,Terrible company,"Our credits for COVID canceled flights in April were set to expire so we used United for a trip to Boise. First, they changed our flight without telling us to consolidate flights (to a 7 am departure) they charge $25 to actually to speak to someone about this and they offer no alternative. Then the day before leaving they message us to say our flight is crowded and we can change flights free of charge. There are no alternate flights available. Never again United, Never again."
Sep 2020,10,WORST Airline EVER,"The legroom is so small. The flight crew was so rude, the airplane was so dirty! the worst flight experience for 2 hours flight"
Sep 2020,50,Amazing customer service,"I took a flight on the 9th and came back on the 18th of September 2020. I have never been on a plane before and was terrified. Not only were the attendants nice to me but even the pilot asked after me. The attendants also came up to me a few times during the flight and when I got off. They were so nice and, while the flying was horrific, they did make me feel better. They also didn't laugh when I ended up having a panic attack (both times) on take off and landing (which sucked)"
Sep 2020,50,Customer care,"I would like to do a review of the customer care of the United Airline. I had a problem with my flight to Toronto. I opened a claim and, I receive a voucher from United and they were really helpful and kind, it's not my first bad experience with airlines in general. Believe me, some of them do not care at all about customers like American Airlines for example I will never fly with that company again. I am giving stars because of their customer care and even after had some problems I would flight with United again!"
Sep 2020,30,Feb 19 - UA4342 Knoxville to Houston EMB-145 (#N13992) Seats 4C & D,"Feb 19 - UA4342 Knoxville to Houston EMB-145 (#N13992) Seats 4C & D    On Wednesday, February 19, we flew United Airlines UA4342, on an EMB-145 (#N13992) from Knoxville (TYS) to Houston (IAH), to connect with our flight home to PHX. This plane was operated by Expressjet Airlines, dba United Express, and it was the fourth time we had taken this flight (two recent ones, on the same aircraft). Normally, we get the Exit Row seats, 18C & D, but they were already taken, when we booked. Oh well, we only had to give up 3 very valuable inches of foot room.    We had arrived at TYS Airport from Blackberry Farm, about 13 miles to the east, and in the mountains, so had a glass of wine at the Ruby Tuesday restaurant, in the main terminal building, waiting for our flight down to Houston, out of Gate 11. The Smoky Mountain Travel Mart, across the concourse, was still closed for renovation, and the area where there is usually an art exhibit, was still empty. We have always enjoyed spending some time with that art exhibit.    Our plane had arrived at Gate 11, when we walked down, and were called to board before Group 1, due to our status. We were in our seats, with my small briefcase store in the overhead bin (only on the starboard side of the aircraft), and my wife’s small, wheeled briefcase barely wedged below Row 3 seats - a bit less legroom for this 2:43 hr flight down to IAH. That is about my absolute maximum limit on an EMB-145 (or CRJ-200). Normally, we try to fly TYS to IAD (Washington/Dulles), and from there home to PHX, but lately, we have not been able to make that IAD connection, so it’s off to IAH, and especially in the Winter, as ORD, EWR or DEN (our other possible hubs) can be nasty. Actually, in the Winter, IAH can be rather nasty too - fog and such.    Our boarding before Group 1 had its advantages, and one needs any advantage on an EMB-145, as there are overhead bins only on the starboard side of the plane - no bins on the port side, at all, so everyone has to use those above the C & D seats. The EMB-145 is configured 1-2, for the entire cabin. The aisle is also about 2"" lower, than the level that the seats are on, so there is a “step-up.” To add to that, the overhead bins (and air duct on the port side) hang low, so one is very likely to bump their head, getting into, or out of the seat. At least the armrests on the aisle seats lift up. We fly EMB-145's too often, and I still hit my head, about every other flight.    Due to the small fuselage, the curvature cuts into legroom from the side, on the A and D seats. I still took the D seat, as I was hoping to get a few shots of the departure from TYS, but with the haze and clouds, that was almost a wasted effort. In our “regular seats,” 18C & D, Row 17 does not recline into us, being the Exit Row. Not so with 4D & C. The passenger in Row 3 reclined after takeoff, and I could not move my knees far enough back, to keep from touching the seatback - lesson learned - book earlier and get the Exit Row seats!.    If there is a bright spot on the EMB-145's, it is that on the starboard C & D) side, there are only two braces for the seats in front, so the width of the underseat storage is a bit wider, than on some larger planes. OK, that is the only bright side. Note that the distance from the floor, to the seat bottom in front of you, is much less, than on a larger plane. Also, the limited overhead bins are shallow, and their opening not very large - not much will fit. Note that unlike on many types of aircraft, the overhead bin doors drop down, and do not lift up. This can cause a bit of a log jam, in deplaning, as people try to lift the bin door up. My wife’s small, wheeled briefcase will not fit in the overhead bin, because it is about ½"" too thick, but will fit under the seat - but just barely. My small briefcase will fit in the overhead bins, with just barely enough room to fold my blazer, and place it atop the briefcase.    We had one passing of the beverage cart, down the very narrow aisle. With our status, we got wine/alcohol at no charge, and we went with the Camelot California Chardonnay - OK, for being served in plastic cups, and not the worst wines we have had.    We had taken off into significant haze (not uncommon in the Smoky Mountains), and were in clouds for most of the flight down to Houston, but at least it was a smooth flight. On approach to IAH, the clouds thickened..    Our flight attendant was very good, and managed the cart, plus completed the beverage service, before landing - something that does not always happen on these short flights.    We arrived at Gate B-19, fifteen minutes late, so had to run to our departure gate, C-11, and a SkyTrain ride away. Where was Global Services to drive us to C-11? Normally, I like to book a minimum connection of about 90 mins, and especially at an airport, like Houston, and especially when flying in on a commuter flight with United Express, but United has tightened this connection, and too much, in my opinion.    In all, a good flight, on a plane that we dislike, but we were safely at IAH, and were going to get in a nice run in the process."
Sep 2020,50,Feb 10 - UA725 Phoenix to Houston 737-900W (#3412) FC Seats 4A & B,"Feb 10 - UA725 Phoenix to Houston 737-900W (#3412) FC Seats 4A & B    On Monday, February 10, we flew United UA725 from Phoenix (PHX) to Houston (IAH), on a 737-900W (#3412) in First Class, Seats 4A & B, for a business trip for my wife, to Houston.    Though we fly almost weekly, this was going to be a very new experience for us, as we were flying out of the recently reopened (major renovation) T3, at PHX. We had gotten to do our “swan song” at the old, now closed T2, just two weeks before. Neither of us had been to T3 in several years, though we had watched the remodel from across the apron, from T2 - it took about 3 years to complete the make-over.    Not having seen the new T3 before, we gave ourselves plenty of time. Our driver, who had been picking up and dropping off at the reopened T3 (Delta had begun operating from there, several months before United moved), took us to south side of the terminal building, for curbside baggage check. There was a United desk out on the sidewalk, but it had not opened yet, so inside we went. First highlight of the day was that one of our friends at United was working the Premier Desk, so our luggage was tagged and off, before we even got to explore the new bag check process. We’d get to experience that next week.    We headed to the west, and around the corner, to the two escalators up to Security, not knowing what to expect. Well, though we are TSA Pre-Check, we are also members of Clear, and they had no line, and an agent just waiting to greet us. Zip - we were through Security, but in totally unfamiliar territory. We followed the signs toward the gates, and noted all of the retail and restaurants open in this area. They even had a bandstand/stage!    We were flying out of E3, and found our gate. As the E section had just opened (about 4 days before), it was not finished yet. There were no restaurants, or bars open on this morning, and the United Club would not be finished for months, and months. We now had plenty of time on our hands.    Luckily, there was good signage, telling us that restaurants and bars were open on the F side of the concourse (the Delta side), so we followed those. We were surprised to see a familiar name, Mark Tarbell, right in front of us. Mark is a chef and restauranteur in Phoenix, and we know his restaurants well - except that we had no idea he had opened his “The Tavern - by Mark Tarbell” at the airport. We went no farther, and just grabbed a table, ready for some wine - Mark is known for his wine selections.    On the way back, we took in the restaurants and retail shops, which were still under construction, and it looked as though some might open in days - nice, as we were flying back out, that week.    With plenty of time still, walked over to the gate, and were boarded before Group 1, due to our status, and quickly into our seats. This flight had only 6 vacant seats, and no empty ones in FC. There were 10 people on the waitlist, so the plane was going to be full, to Houston.    Our jackets were hung in the closet, across from the galley, and we were ready for our flight.  We took off on Runway 7L, into a slightly hazy sky, with a fairly thick layer of clouds above. We were in clouds, all of the way into IAH..    This 737-900 (#3412), was from the Continental side of the fleet, and had an older cabin, and smaller overhead bins, but wife’s wheeled briefcase fit nicely. My briefcase fit under the seat in front, and my hat fit in the middle section, as the IFE (DirectTV) equipment took up quite a bit of that underseat real estate. On this flight, the DirectTV functioned fine, which was good, as there was nothing to see outside my window.    On the way to IAH, we had a snack of Moroccan Chicken w/ couscous and hummus, which was pretty good, and a Cheese & Fruit Plate, which was also pretty good. We opted for the Guenoc California Sauvignon Blanc, which was a fairly recent addition to the wine lineup on United, and not bad, though a bit over the top with the acidity.    We arrived at IAH on-time, and had our luggage quickly (not always the case at IAH), and were off to the Medical Center, for my wife’s first meeting.    The flight was good, though this particular aircraft was showing a bit of age. The seat was comfortable, and the cabin crew very pleasant and efficient. While we have had many UA agents thank us for our patronage, and for being Global Services, we did experience a first on this flight. The Purser gave us a Thank You card telling us how nice we were as passengers, and thanked us for being Global Services - that was very nice, and very unexpected. The agents at PHX were excellent, and especially as they had just moved to this new location, days before. We are scheduled to fly this same route, next week, for meetings in Tampa/St Petersburg, FL."
Sep 2020,40,Feb 14 - UA316 Phoenix to Washington/Dulles 737-900 (#3473) FC Seats 2A & B,"Feb 14 - UA316 Phoenix to Washington/Dulles 737-900 (#3473) FC Seats 2A & B    We flew United Airlines UA316 from Phoenix (PHX) to Washington/Dulles (IAD) on a 737-900 (#3473) in First Class, seats 2A & B (left, or port side) on Friday, February 14. This was the first leg of a trip to Knoxville, TN (TYS), for a leisure trip - with zero business to be conducted.    This was our second time into the newly remodeled T3 at PHX. United had just moved their operations there, from the venerable, old T2, which was now closed. We had explored the new facilities at T3, as we had given ourselves plenty of time, prior to that departure. It was not the case for this flight. Though we always arrive at least 1 hr, prior to boarding (not departure), this morning, things were not going smoothly. We had learned that UA did not have curbside baggage check open on the south side of T3, a few days before, so went to the north side curb, but the UA outside check-in was not open yet - it was an early flight to the East Coast. We rushed inside, and at least knew where we needed to go, with the luggage, and were through that, and on to TSA Security, with not that much time to spare. Clear was up and running, and we were through Security, and made our way to Gate E3, from which we had flown out, days earlier. In the main area of T3, folk were setting up a bandstand, with pink, heart-shaped balloons. Obviously, live music for Valentine Day - just a bit later. All in good time, and I got a chance to see that progress had been made in getting retail and restaurants open on the East Pier of T3 - progress in 5 days! However, no progress on the United Club, by E3 & E5. We just did a quick survey, then returned to E3, in time to board, before Group 1, due to status. We were in our seats, with a glass each of the Ca’ di Rajo Mitō sparkling wine - our jackets hanging in the little closet, across from the forward galley.    This 737-900 was an older ship, and from the United side of the fleet, so no DirectTV. It also had the older, smaller overhead bins, but those were more than adequate for my wife’s small, rolling briefcase.    I had been amazed at how many seats were available on this flight - it was, at most, 2/3 full, and everyone had cleared from the waitlist. Only one person, however, was upgraded to FC. Being the early flight, in February, and on a Friday, was perhaps a factor, as we fly PHX-IAD often, and never see this many empty seats.    While it was mostly clear at PHX, we were soon into significant haze, so my choice of the window seat, vs the aisle seat was not rewarded. Then, we were into, and above significant clouds, and I only caught a glimpse of snow on the mountains of New Mexico. We had clouds, until we began our final approach to IAD, with our usual big circle over the Virginia countryside, for landing. I was glad that things were clear, as we were connecting to our flight back over the mountains to Knoxville, TN (TYS).    This plane had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) delivering streaming media via one’s device, and the United App. This was free, and worked well. I was glad, as there was virtually nothing to see out of the window. It was also equipped with WiFi (for a fee), but neither of us used that, so I cannot comment on how well it worked.    As this was the “breakfast flight,” we had our choice between:  A Cheese & Ham Bowl - actually pretty good  A Breakfast Fritatta - also pretty good, but a bit too heavy on the red pepper purée    We had the Guenoc Sauvignon Blanc, which is now the standard white wine in FC, over the last few months. A bit too high in acid for us, but it’ll do.    Our flight was smooth, and we landed a few minutes early - giving us more time for better wine at IAD.    The cabin crew was very good, as had been the UA agents at PHX, who were, like us, just learning the new T3 operations.    We were off to IAD Concourses A & B, for our United Express flight over to TYS, and had time to stop into one of our favorite airport wine bars, Vino Volo, before our departure. Always a good thing."
Sep 2020,40,Feb 19 - UA2256 Houston to Phoenix 737-800 (#3264) FC Seats 2E & F,"Feb 19 - UA2256 Houston to Phoenix 737-800 (#3264) FC Seats 2E & F    On Wednesday, February 19, we flew home to Phoenix (PHX) from Houston (IAH) after a leisure trip to the Smoky Mountains. We flew UA2256, on a 737-800 (#3264), in First Class, seats 2E & F. We had just flown back to Phoenix from Houston after business meetings, on February 12, but on a different flight.    We were connecting from TYS (Knoxville), and our flight was late arriving at Gate B24. Normally, I like to have 90 minutes between flights, and especially at airports, such as IAH, and especially if flying in on a United Express commuter flight, then out on United. In this case, we were going out of C-ll, so had to run to the SkyTrain, then to the gate. Under normal circumstances, a Global Services representative would be waiting on the jetbridge, to whisk us across the tarmac, to Gate C-11. There was no one waiting for us, so we sprinted to the SkyTrain. We arrived just as boarding began, and because of our status, boarded before Group 1. We were seated, with our jackets hanging in the forward closet. Before the doors closed, a Global Services rep came aboard to tell us “thank you for your loyalty, and glad that you made it... “ Where was she, and the Mercedes, when we were sprinting to make this flight? Oh well, never mind, as we made the flight!    This 737-800 was from the Continental side of the fleet, and was older, with DirectTV and the smaller overhead bins. The upside was that we had DirectTV, which worked well, but there is a downside too: the DirectTV equipment takes up some of the underseat storage. In our case, my hat fit nicely, as did my small briefcase, and my wife’s small, rolling briefcase fit easily into the overhead bin. The seats were comfortable, and even with the items underseat, we had adequate legroom.    We had a snack on the flight, which was a choice of either:  Southwest Chicken w/ bean and corn salad, or a Cold Cut & Cheese Plate w/ fruit. Both were pretty good, but the Southwest Chicken the better. However, that might be because we have had that Cold Cut Plate so very often lately?    We sat back with our DirectTV, and especially as the weather was not nice in Houston, so nothing to see out of my window, until we were on final approach to Phoenix, where it was a lovely afternoon, with just a bit of haze.    The gate agents at IAH were just fine, and the cabin crew was very good, and our service was excellent. I am not impressed with Global Services at IAH, but then they seem to be the weakest UA hub airport group, in the entire corporation. Their groups at IAD, SFO, ORD, LHR and especially LAX, are much, much better. I think that the folk at IAH need a bit more staff, or maybe a bit more training.    We arrived at Gate E5 in the recently redone T3 at PHX. We were on-time, and our luggage was up quickly. This was only the second time that we had experienced the Baggage Claim area at T3, but that was only a few days before, and also on return from IAH. In moments our car was curbside on the south side of the terminal, and we were headed home, to repack for a business trip to Tampa/St Petersburg, FL, and back through IAH, yet again!"
Sep 2020,40,Feb 12 - UA1115 Houston to Phoenix 737-900 (#3440) FC Seats 3E & F,"Feb 12 - UA1115 Houston to Phoenix 737-900 (#3440) FC Seats 3E & F    On Wednesday, February 12, we flew home to Phoenix (PHX) from Houston (IAH) after several days of meetings for my wife. This was on UA1115, on a 737-900 (#3440), in First Class, seats 3E & F.    We had arrived at IAH early, from downtown Houston. Our flight was not due to depart, until 6:35pm, and as we had not eaten in town, decided to stop into Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen, on Concourse E, especially as we were departing from Gate E-22 (changed from E-20). We still had time, so stopped into the United Club on Concourse E, for Champagne.    In our explorations of IAH, we discovered that some areas, which had been closed for construction, on our previous trip, were now open, with several new restaurants, and retail shops. United has been remodeling many of its concourses, at several airports, and IAH is one - lots of new places. While each seems thematically different: Asian Market, Brew Pub, etc., there is a similarity in that most now offer ordering via a tablet. One can also pay with United MileagePlus Miles. The food offerings do differ, depending on the theme, but the wine lists look almost the same. If the restaurant/bar is a “brew pub,” the beers/ales do differ a bit, location to location. We also noticed that a favorite wine bar of ours, Beaudevine, at the end of Concourse E, is now a Tex-Mex Grill/Bar. While sad to loose Beaudevine, perhaps we will give this new place a try?    We boarded a few minutes late, just before Group 1, and were seated, with our jackets hanging in the forward closet. We passed on a pre-departure beverage, as the only white wine they had was the Guenoc Sauvignon Blanc, which is not our favorite. Also, we had done wines at both the restaurant and the United Club. We also passed on the snack too, as nothing sounded interesting to us.    This 737-900 was from the Continental side of the fleet, and was older, with DirectTV and the smaller overhead bins. The upside was that we had DirectTV, which worked well for this night flight, but there is a downside too: the DirectTV equipment takes up some of the underseat storage. In our case, my hat fit nicely, as did my small briefcase, and my wife’s small, rolling briefcase fit easily into the overhead bin. The seats were comfortable, and even with the items underseat, we had adequate legroom.    We sat back with our DirectTV, and half dozed on the flight home.    The gate agents at IAH were just fine, and the cabin crew was very good, and our service was excellent, for what we had.    We arrived at Gate E3 in the recently redone T3 at PHX - the same gate we had departed from, days earlier. We were on-time, and our luggage was up quickly. This was the first time we had experienced the Baggage Claim area at T3, which was all new to us. In moments our car was curbside on the south side of the terminal, and we were headed home, and to bed. In all, a very nice flight."

Sep 2020,30,Feb - UA4845 Washington/Dulles to Knoxville CRJ-200 (#N437AW) E+ Seats 8C & D,"Feb - UA4845 Washington/Dulles to Knoxville CRJ-200 (#N437AW) E+ Seats 8C & D    On Friday, February 14, we flew UA4845 from Washington/Dulles (IAD) to Knoxville, TN (TYS) on a CRJ-200 (#N437AW), operated by Air Wisconsin, dba United Express). This was the last leg of our flights PHX-IAD-TYS, for a week at Blackberry Farm, in Walland, TN, for a culinary and wine event.    The CRJ-200 is a small, regional jet, and is a one-class cabin. We were in the Exit Row seats, 8C & D, which, due to the slightly increased legroom, is termed E+. This craft is configured 2-2. On the CRJ-200 the Seats are 17"" wide, and all E seats have a pitch of 31"", while the Exit Row seats (E+) have a pitch of 34"".    In the Exit Row, we had ample legroom, which was good, as this ship has tiny overhead bins. My wife’s small, rolling briefcase will not fit, due to the height, but will barely fit, under the seat in front. My small briefcase does fit in the overhead bin. As we had jackets and overcoats, plus my hat, we were busy stuffing things into those bins, and under the seat, as there is no closet for coats.    This is one of our least favorite planes in the United Express fleet, along with the EMB-145. Unfortunately, we usually have to fly one, or the other, into/out of TYS.    This flight was full, but it seemed that everyone had overhead bin space, though probably because the Gate Agents were gate-checking many rollaboards, especially the larger ones.    We had a rather long layover at IAD, and had spent that time first at the United Club on Concourse C, then had moved over to the co-joined concourses A & B, for some wine at Vino Volo, right at the juncture of those two concourses. We walked over to the Concourse A side, with plenty of time to spare.    We flew out of Terminal A Gate A1C, which feels like its almost an airport away. Concourse A serves mostly “commuter” craft, and we find the gate areas to be a bit Spartan, and usually congested. As we have high status, we boarded right behind those passengers with disabilities, so were seated, and out of the way, about the time that Group 1 boarded. Also, many of the gates in Concourse A, are multiple gates, so it is always a mad scramble, when one’s boarding group is called - often there will be 2-3 flights boarding at each gate, so listening carefully for, say Gate A1C, and the destination, is critical. There is always a high noise level at these gates, as they are horribly crowded, and the gate agents do not always speak clearly - so listen very, very carefully.    Being an evening flight, we saw nothing out of the window, except the airport tarmac at IAD.    Our flight was a bit bumpy, and especially as we approached TYS, but that is quite common, even after sunset. Other than that, and a plane which we dislike, it was a good flight, and one which we make often. Mercifully, it is a short flight, though getting to IAD from PHX is a bit longer, but that is always in a larger ship, and usually a 737-900. The Flight Attendant was very good, and cheerful. We did not accept any in-flight beverage, and especially as we were seated in the starboard Exit Row. We will be making this flight several more times in the near future."
Sep 2020,10,Worst airline ever!,"First of all, I booked a flight on United through a 3rd party, had to cancel due to COVID, United refused to give me a refund and wanted to charge $50 to rebook a new flight for me. I also paid for internet service in the flight that didn't work - picture attached of the ongoing loading screen I get. This is on top of all the other horrible services I've experienced with them over the years. Never flying United again. At least the flight attendants are nice - the only redeeming factor."
Sep 2020,40,For once a nice crew on boad,"Although I try to avoid UA (in economy) because too often I have found the crew (mainly the flight attendants) unwelcoming, belittling, rude, with an insincere smile and some of them with a real attitude. I also understand that it's not an easy job. This being said yesterday the crew was super nice (I flew on 9/25) and deserving a positive review. From the moment in came on board, I felt welcome, when I got to my seat (back of the plane) a male flight attendant acknowledged politely and genuinely ""welcome on board, please let me know if there is anything I can do for you"" and from there everything went smoothly. True, the plane was almost empty, but for once the crew seems to care about travelers in the ""back of the plane""."
Sep 2020,50,Anniversary Trip to South Padre Island Texas,I never had two flights connect so smoothly and right on time! I haven't seen my son since the pandemic started and we really needed to take a chance to get out there to see him. I am so glad we chose United. South West often delayed and canceled flights so I was very hesitant to use them even if they were cheaper. I felt safe and cared for with united. They gave us alcohol wipes for the seats. Only one or two people coughed the entire flight.
Sep 2020,10,Completely Unorganized,"I have not even been ON the flight yet and dealing with them alone has been a nightmare. I called to make reservations stating I was traveling with 2 dogs and 1 cat, and that I needed animals in cargo. I was told that was fine and to pay for my (non refundable) tickets first and then do the pet part second. I get my tickets and get forwarded to the next person. They tell me that UA is not doing pets in cargo because of Covid 19 and that person 1 made a mistake. From there it devolved and I've never had a worse experience. They aren't even quick on getting my service dog cleared at the very least and every time I called the protocol was different. 10/10 would never recomend. I have to fly my pets with a completely separate airline and United wouldn't even refund me so I could go on a separate airline with them because of their mistake."
Sep 2020,10,Do Not Fly,Social distancing non existent. They do not enforce the mask policy. Multiple people on my flight not wearing masks and flight attendants said nothing. People with no masks were served their snacks with the attendant looking straight at them and no one was asked to wear their mask. Do not fly this airline during the pandemic. They do not care about you or your safety. They care about their pocketbook.
Sep 2020,10,MR,United isnt social distancing and over booking flights. Looking around the cabin all I see is every seat is full and when you check in via the app they try to get you to change flights.
Sep 2020,10,Terrible service,Terrible customer service. No one know the rules transferred from rep to rep. Do not care about customer. Fly JetBlue or Alaska
Sep 2020,10,"Never, EVER, fly United.","Since I really do not want to get myself upset by typing the whole thing again, I am just going to copy the exact email that I sent to the United customer relations team. For reference, out of everything I told them, they replied We appreciate your feedback, we apologize, and we are conducting an internal investigation. I tried to resolve this issue and have someone actually care about it before I posted it on review sites, but it is clear that they really do not care how issues are dealt with.    ""Let me just preface this by saying I know things happen, I know flights get delayed and I know that your protocol is to do anything to fix it. But, I need to tell you a little bit about what I experienced. The morning was fine, we boarded our flight perfectly fine, it’s when we were sitting in the lot that was the issue. There was clearly something wrong, we weren’t moving so anyone could figure that out. The first issue that I had was with the two flight attendants that could care less about their job or the safety and well being of their passengers. While we were sitting there waiting to take off, they thought it was a good idea to “sit their a** down” (words of one of the flight attendants) in the passenger seats directly behind me. With their masks OFF I might add (Um are you kidding me?). They then began to gossip about their personal relationships, not that it’s any of my business, but the one claimed she was only with her boyfriend because he’ll do anything for her, but she’s only with him because of her needs in the bedroom. When she said he offered to get her a pedicure, she promptly said “f**k your pedicure”.    If their personal lives weren’t enough information for me to file a complaint, just wait until I tell you about the things they said and accused people of about your company. The one said “I’m only still working here because I’m stuck, it’s not where I wanted to end up but…”. That’s great to hear, that the flight attendant you trust with your life doesn’t give a s*** about her job! When the pilot announced the time in the air she said and I quote: “that means nothing. He’s a moron… so annoying”. The pilot apparently isn’t the only one that they have issues with. They accused someone of being asked to resign from Mesa because of her apparent drug addiction, “she’s a compulsive liar, she’s not a f***ing nurse”, was what one of the flight attendants said. But wait, I saved one of the best ones for last. Sharing their alleged sexual assault experiences, J**** M****** (might be spelled wrong), the European one with the bald head and the glasses needs to be looked out for apparently. I mean…. Is that serious? They just accused someone that works for you of sexual assault while sitting within ear shot of people that are trusting your company with their lives, SERIOUSLY????    If that wasn’t enough, after about 45 minutes we were asked to deplane. We waited in line for about an hour and a half, and I didn’t get on a plane until noon. We were delayed for FIVE hours without one apology given. Oh wait, the $10 food voucher piece of paper said we apologize. Not that I expect to get a free flight or anything but dang, $10 for a 5 hour delay….? I missed work because I missed my connecting flight today. This entire experience was so ridiculous and I can’t express my disappointment enough."""
Sep 2020,10,NOT SAFE!!,I had to do a last min flight change to United and was dumbfounded when we walked into the aircraft. EVERY SEAT WAS TAKEN IT WAS A FUKL FLIGHT! Including the middle seats were taken. I had to sit in the middle of two ppl and I was almost in tears the entire flight. How is there no sadly precautions? How was the flight so packed? HOW WAS THIS ALLOWED! There was not even one open seat person next to me sneezed and I asked to stay in the bathroom till the flight landed. I have never ever felt so unsafe in my life!! I cudnt believe that during this pandemic UA don’t care about anything but their pockets. Horrible never again EVER!
Sep 2020,20,Price,What major airline would charge you for a carry on? This one. I was shocked they made me check my carry on at the ticket counter. I rarely fly united for leisure or business but this has helped my re enforce my choice to over look then in the future.
Sep 2020,10,Avoid United Perks Plus Award Program,"I attended a conference and won 2 Economy Tickets in the continental US. When I went to collect, the United Website System failed multiple times and had multiple Server Errors. I was forced to call reservations and it was a total nightmare. The CSR was nice but, had to get 2 supervisors on the phone. I was on the phone for almost an 1.5 hours. I was flying with my kids and I was told that the 3rd ticket would be included due to the multiple issues. I said ""Great"" Thank you! I never received the confirmation email. So, I called back the next day. I was then told that they would not Comp my ticket and spent another hour on the phone with a Supervisor. When I tried to schedule the trip, all of the economy tickets were sold and I wasn't able to book. This is the worst Customer Service and System I have ever experienced and I didn't even get a change to fly with them!"
Sep 2020,10,Worst experience ever,I will never fly with United Airlines ever again and I will continue to broadcast my experience on the internet and encourage people to stay away from United. Customer service sucks! They changed my flight time 3 days before the flight and not only did they inconvenience me but I was transferred to 5 different reps and they couldn’t accommodate me in anyway. They wanted me to pay $600 for a time change that I wasn’t able to comply to because they originally changed my time on July 31 and didn’t notify us until September 21. They split me and my little sister up and tried to make her ride in a different flight time than me. Worst first flight experience and the last. I will never fly United.
Sep 2020,10,"Victor Marx Video. United discriminates. I will not fly united again. I’m a flight attendant, how he was treated unjust.","I have personally seen United airlines flight attendants get away with way too much. I am a flight attendant myself, and I’m very disappointed with how they treat American citizens. Shame on you guys for treating me poorly on my flight due to my Trump key chain. Now I see online it’s happens all the time. Poor victor Marx family. He has photos to prove that he had his mask the same way as the captain"
Sep 2020,10,Shoddy second class service,"First, the airport did not honor the fact that frequent travelers have paid to be identified and crowded everyone in a cramped area where there was no way to maintain distancing. SHAMEFUL!    Flight 1646 broke down on the flight line and was eventually sent back to the gate, the flight was delayed several hours to replace the plane. All the while everything associated with United’s procedures fell woefully short maintaining the safety of the customers regarding the virus. Your staff, accommodations, equipment, process, all would get an ‘F’ if graded. You put the lives of everyone o that plane in jeopardy because of sloppy procedures and overcrowding!! And with all the inconvenience, United’s staff offered nothing more than a “this kind of thing happens all the time,” type apology."
Sep 2020,10,Worse flight ever. United doesn’t want to compensate,"United, I just had a worse ever trip because of your schedule changes. 21 hour layover with a baby and you don’t refund for a hotel? I also lost 3 pieces of luggage because of this 21 hours layover caused by your schedule changes. I was your loyal customer for years. No more"
Sep 2020,10,Rude and Careless Staff,"Our first business class experience with United made sure we won’t ever fly with them again. SFO to Cabo flight was delayed for 4 hours. Coming back we were seated away from each other amid our timely check in the day prior and a phone call we placed to confirm we will be seated next to each other. Throughout the SFO-Cabo flight, half the business class was wearing their masks and the crew did not care to remind. On the way back, their family separation tactic made sure more people can spread Covid. When we asked what was the reason of separating us after our confirmation, Sandra Vazguez’s come back was “I don’t think you are listening to me carefully. You have 2 choices, either talk to the gate agent or you can leave on another plane at another day”. Proven United Airlines have excellent code of ethics and employee training. Fly with them if you want to be mistreated."
Sep 2020,30,The count,"The gate agent filled the plane back to front. It went smoothly. Flight was full and almost all seats were taken. Agent had a count of 45 on paper and 46 in the plane....this lead to a 15 min delay. We were told to check our tickets and be sure we were flying to the correct city several times. Finally the captain stepped in and we were off and arrived on time. There was very limited over head space. There were no drinks or snacks or booze, not even a pre wrapped water pack for first class. Everyone wore masks. Plane was crowed. Getting off the plane was suppose to be by rows but it did not go smoothly. WiFi on flight was broken."
Sep 2020,40,Jan - UA2388 San Francisco to Phoenix 737-900ER (#3466) FC Seats 3E & F,"Jan - UA2388 San Francisco to Phoenix 737-900ER (#3466) FC Seats 3E & F    After a few days of a wine event in San Francisco, on January 28, we flew UA2388 from SFO to PHX on a 737-900ER (#3466) in First Class, in Seats 3E & F.    We had arrived a bit early to SFO, so had time on our hands. As this was a late morning flight, we decided to stop for wine at the United Club near Gate E-4 (moved from E-12), but still no issues. Note: the United gates in T3 have all been renumbered, so one might need to check with the United App, for the location of their departure gate now - it is not the same.    This flight, just like our PHX-DEN flight, to start this trip, was not full, with even 2 seats in FC available. I did not see the upgrade list, but assume that two status fliers got moved up front.    We boarded on time, and were quickly into our seats, with our jackets hung in the closest across from the galley.    This 737 was from the United side of the fleet, so no DirectTV, but it had both free PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), and WiFi (for a fee). We did not use the latter, but the PDE streaming worked fine on this short flight.    The First Class seats in the 737's are configured 2-2, and are comfortable, with a 38"" pitch, a 21"" width and decent recline - except that Row 5 is against the bulkhead, so less recline. In First Class, we had an earplug jack each, plus an AC outlet each, in the back of the podium of the seats in Row 2, and those worked well. The AC can only be used above 10,000' so it’s good to have a charge on one’s device.    The weather was overcast and rainy, at SFO, so any chance of getting a good shot of the Golden Gate Bridge was not going to happen on this flight. We were happy to be getting out, when we were, as the weather was slated to get even worse, as the day went on. At least the weather was fairly clear at PHX.    With our briefcases stored (wife’s in overhead, and mine under the seat in front of me), and our jackets hanging in the forward closet by the galley, we settled in for our pre-departure beverage.    We had flown into SFO with heavy haze and smoke from the wildfires, and would be flying out with the same weather.  This plane was from the Continental side of the fleet, and had DirectTV. It was also one of the older 737's with the old ceiling, and smaller overhead bins. A downside of the sCO part of the fleet of 737's, is that the DirectTV equipment takes up a fair amount of the underseat storage, but my wife’s rolling briefcase fit nicely above, and with a bit of wedging, my briefcase fit below the seat in front of me. There was even room for her purse, and my hat. With DirectTV, the safety demo is a video, and this one linked to the Spider Man movie. Though this new safety demo was just starting its run, I had already grown tired of it, just as the Spider Man napkins were becoming boring too. Hope that there will be a new demo soon!    We took off on Runway 1L, and that often means a view of the Golden Gate Bridge, but our immediate turn was tighter, than any I can recall, and we looped back over SFO, and then over the lower tip of San Francisco Bay and the salt ponds - something that we have never done before. No Golden Gate Bridge on this flight, but the salt ponds were colorful in the evening light. Almost immediately, we were into the clouds, and only caught a few brief glimpses of the ground, all the way into PHX, where night had descended.    The flight was very good, and the DirectTV worked well (not always the case), and that made me happy, as with the haze, clouds and smoke, there was not much to see outside the window.    We arrived at PHX T2, and parked at Gate 6B. Our luggage was quickly up on Carousel 4, and we were headed home.    The Gate Agents at SFO were very good, and we actually knew one, from our frequent flights out of SFO. The Cabin Crew was good, as well, and United made this short business trip as comfortable, as they could."
Sep 2020,40,Jan - UA1774 Phoenix to Denver 737-900 (#3464) FC Seats 5E & F,"Jan - UA1774 Phoenix to Denver 737-900 (#3464) FC Seats 5E & F    On Saturday, January 25, we flew United Airlines UA1774, from Phoenix (PHX) to Denver (DEN) in First Class, Seats 5E & F on a 737-900 (#3464), as the first leg of our trip to San Francisco. Because this was a last minute trip, we had to take a connection through DEN, and also take seats, which are not our favorites. We have flown this route often, and it usually has an A319/320. However, what was going to be new to us, was the next, DEN - SFO leg.    Our morning began at the United Club at PHX, with a glass of Champagne to toast our old UA Club, and then walked down to Gate 5 in T2. This was going to be one of the last times, that we would fly out of T2 at PHX, or visit the United Club there, as T3 had just opened, and United would be moving all operations there, in February. The United Club would go away, while a new one in T3 was being built. This was sort of a “swan song” for us, as we flew out of T2 almost weekly for 20 years. It was like saying good-bye to a very old friend, and that United Club was almost a second home to us.    I was a bit surprised, as there were about 20 seats showing empty, when we got to the gate, and 1 in First Class, then 12 in E+. Usually, the skiers fill the flights to Denver in the Winter.    The plane was doing a “yo-yo” between Denver and Phoenix, and had just pulled into Gate 5, when we arrived from the Club. We boarded quickly, and on-time. The crew did not change, and these folk knew the weather between PHX and DEN, having just flown down. Our jackets were hanging in the little closet, across from the galley, and we just sat back, to enjoy our short flight up to Denver.    Our plane, #3464, was from the Continental side of the combined fleet, and had DirectTV. The only issue that I have with those 737's is that the DirectTV equipment does occupy some underseat real estate, but on this flight, my small briefcase, my hat and my wife’s purse fit OK. This was also one of the newer 737's, and it had the “Dreamliner” ceiling and lighting, and the larger overhead bins. My wife’s rolling briefcase fit easily into those. Our DirectTV worked well, which was nice, as we had a bit of haze out of PHX, and were into the clouds, so not so great views of our window. One of the nice things about the sCO 737's, is that the safety video is via the DirectTV. A good thing about this flight, is that the newish Star Wars safety video was shown, replacing the insipid Spider Man video, from last year. While the Star Wars video is not the best in the bunch (we like United’s very first safety video better), anything beats that Spider Man one.    The First Class seats in the 737's are comfortable, with a 38"" pitch, a 21"" width and decent recline - except that Row 5 is against the bulkhead, so less recline. Not bad, but not as good as in the first 4 rows. Still, adequate recline for this short flight up to Denver. In First Class, we had an earplug jack each, plus an AC outlet each, in the back of the podium of the seats in Row 4, and those worked well. The AC can only be used above 10,000' so it’s good to have a charge on one’s device.    This plane was showing signs of wear and tear, and the seatback pocket in 5F was broken and the right side hanging down - no real issues, but unsightly, and in need of repair/replacement.    We pushed back from the gate on-time, and I took some good long looks, as we might not see T2 ever again. We headed to Runway 7L, so we would be taking off to the East, for an easy vector toward Denver.    We passed from haze, into the clouds, with very, very little to see on the flight into Denver. Often, on this route, we get a glimpse of the Painted Desert, and maybe even Meteor Crater, plus views of the Rocky Mountains, but little to see.    We had a warm cookie, and my wife and I opted for the Tunnel of Elms Chardonnay, which was a fairly new addition to the United wines - not bad.    We encountered some turbulence into DEN, which is common, but it was not bad. We arrived Gate B-26 (moved from B-29) a bit early, and as we had a good connection (I hate to rush in airports), we headed to Elway’s, in the center of the B Concourse, for some breakfast, prior to our flight from DEN to SFO.    The weather was nice at DEN, but we could see heavy clouds over the Front Range, so knew we would have some roughness, on our climb over the Rockies. We were glad that we would be getting out, before those clouds moved over the airport.    A nice flight, even with no impressive views out of the window, and the crew was very good, as had been the gate agents at PHX."
Sep 2020,40,"Jan - Denver to San Francisco, UA1478, 737-900ER (#3462), FC Seats 5E & F","Jan - Denver to San Francisco, UA1478, 737-900ER (#3462), FC Seats 5E & F    We were flying Phoenix (PHX) to San Francisco (SFO), but had to do it via Denver (DEN) for this flight, which was added late. We flew DEN to SFO on UA 1478, on a 737-900ER (#3462) in First Class, seats 5E & F - not our favorite seats, but like the connection at DEN, we had no choices. These flights were on Saturday, January 25.    As we had a liberal connection time, we had lunch at Elway’s, near our departure gate, and then wines at 5280 Bar, on the upper-level of the concourse. We had spent so much time in the United Clubs recently, that we wanted something different for wines.    We made our way to the departure gate, B-55 (moved from B-11 - so quite a walk), with plenty of time to board, and were quickly into our seats. Our jackets were hung in the little closet, forward by the galley. I had noticed that this was a full flight, with one each FC and E+ available, and only maybe two E seats. I did not see the waitlist, so do not know how many might have been unable to get on, and also only one upgrade into First.    This plane was from the Continental side of the fleet, and had DirectTV. The only issue that I have with those 737's is that the DirectTV equipment does occupy some underseat real estate, but my small briefcase, my hat and my wife’s purse fit OK. As this was one of the newer 737's, it had the “Dreamliner” ceiling and lighting, and the larger overhead bins. My wife’s rolling briefcase fit easily into those. We have had some issues with the connectivity of DirectTV on some United flights, but the system worked well on this flight. One of the aspects, which I like about DirectTV is that it has the Flight Path Channel, to show what is down below. I use that feature a lot, on International flights, whenever we are over a land mass. While it has movies (along with TV programs), the streaming IFE on the non-Continental planes, has a greater selection - if one wants movies.    The First Class seats in the 737's are comfortable, with a 38"" pitch, a 21"" width and decent recline - except that Row 5 is against the bulkhead, so less recline. Not bad, but not as good as in the first 4 rows.    It was a nice day at the airport, except for a bit of haze. However, there were heavy clouds over the Front Range, and after flying over Boulder, we were into those, so visibility was limited.    Having just had wines in the airport, we declined the pre-departure beverage, but did go with the Guenoc Sauvignon Blanc, with our snack:  Moroccan Chicken Salad w/ couscous and hummus - pretty good, and better than the Thai Chicken Salad, that United had for about a year.  Cheese, Fruit, Nut and Cold Cut Plate - again, pretty good, and light enough.  Both came with a Ghirardelli Sea Salt & Caramel Dark Chocolate bar.    The flight was mostly smooth, and from time to time, we had breaks in the low clouds, but always seemed to have haze, and a thin layer of high clouds, for most of the flight. There were a few interesting views, starting over the Western Slope and into Utah, but those high clouds were almost always with us, though thinned out a bit, over Nevada, and as we crossed into California - though it was not a pretty day in San Francisco. Now, I did get a good view of Crescent Dunes Solar Collector Station, near Hawthorne, NV, which I had never seen before. We often fly over Ivanpah, with its three collectors, near the Mojave Desert, but we just seldom fly this far to the north, when approaching San Francisco. Even with the less than perfect weather, there was enough scenery below, that I barely looked at the DirectTV, except to pinpoint where we were, on the map - all new territory to me.    Then I saw Walker Lake, followed by Lake Mono w/ Paoha Island, a site we often seen on our PHX-SFO flights, and knew that we were going to land on Runway 28, after skirting San Jose and the southern end of San Francisco Bay. We were dropping slightly south, for our final approach into SFO. From here on out, I was over familiar territory, but still visually beautiful, and diverse territory.    And sure enough, we landed on Runway 28L, and taxied to Gate F-17 (moved from F-18). Note: SFO has changed the gate names, and this is especially noticed in T3, which United uses. Luckily, United had notified us long ago, that these changes would happen, and then again, via the United App. We had our luggage on Carousel 5, and were headed into the city to attend a wine maker event.    A very nice flight, with a good crew. While the underseat storage was a bit tight, due to the DirectTV equipment, we still had plenty of room, and everything on the flight functioned well. Even the food was pretty good."
Sep 2020,40,Refund me the checked bags and you're golden,"I was thoroughly impressed with every personal encounter from the baggage check to the pilot. Exceptional customer service and flight communications. However, like another reviewer, I was appalled to see so many people tossing their carryons onto the plane overhead when I was required to pay 140 dollars (round trip flight) for two bags that met the size and weight requirements. I had to read the fine print to see that no carryons were permitted. Why the double standard, and how can I get a refund?"
Sep 2020,10,Passengers without masks.,"We bought tickets in first class thinking it would be safer with COVID-19. Two young men behind us did not wear masks. I asked the attendant why not, she only then requested them to put on masks. About 10 minutes into the flight, the masks came off and they drank the next two hours, talking and laughing very loud right into our breathing space. Not a safe situation for two seniors going to visit 96 yr old mom. The flight was entirely full, and the gate moved the guys to first where they could drink for free for over two hours. It felt like riding in a bar, with no way to protect ourselves! Will never trust United again."
Sep 2020,10,Carry on,Website says no carry on bags.  So does ticket.  So we spent money to check in our bags. Get to the gate and most people have brought carry on bags and were allowed to take them.  Im upset because we followed rules and get punished with 140 bucks in bag fees for two small bags. While others were breaking the rules with no consequence.
Sep 2020,40,Coming Home,"Had a miserably full flight on the way out but coming home, both legs were quite comfortable and the handicapped assistance provided at the layover airport by United was friendly, knowledgeable, and very accommodating. The in-air staff was beyond friendly and helpful in maintaining a clean and comfortable environment during a time when it matters more than ever. Thanks, United!"
Sep 2020,40,UA2228,"I was watching how detailed the pilot was checking the outside of the plane, which made me feel that our safety was his first priority. I really appreciate it! The flight was very packed with poor air circulation. With the masks and extreme turbulence, I got a headache and felt nauseous. I don't believe flights should be booked to full capacity with Covid happening."
Sep 2020,10,United Overall Service in ALL categories Continues to Decline,"My problems with United are too numerous to mention in this review from lack of advance notice for flight changes, telephone representatives not knowing the COVID flight reimbursement rules (I spent over an hour with one representative) and lack of adequate distancing on FULL flights!    However, my latest Labor Day trip flying First Class was really the last straw! The 4:45pm EST flight from Orlando to Denver did not even provide a healthy snack box in First Class (compared to the Denver to Spokane 8pm flight and my return flights back to Orlando). We were provided cookies and pretzels at First Class prices. In addition, one flight attendant worked the First Class section for the first hour and then nothing the next 2 and 1/2. Twice I went to the restroom and saw her on her cell phone as she sat in the jump seat. After 45 minutes without any contact from anyone, I rang my call button just to get some water.    During the Spokane flight, the pilot had to announce that some people were not following proper safety protocols and reminded everyone (in a stern voice) that masks were required to be on except when eating or drinking. Obviously, the flight attendants were not enforcing the rules. All my flights were completely FULL and United sent a message 24 hours before each stating that if you were uncomfortable with this situation, you could change your flight. However, what is the chance the next flight wasn't just as full?!! United takes your money months in advance and then tells to you take another flight if you are uncomfortable the day of your flight! Great customer service.    Finally, United has stated they will no longer have change fees in 2021. But, don't count on them to make an exception now-even for United Plus members. I have one more flight on United this year and I noticed the price went down by $56 almost 3 weeks later after I purchased it. I called ""Customer Care"" requesting a travel credit for my next flight, but was told their current change policy requires I pay a $50 fee to get the $56 credit. That did it for me. They can keep the $56 and I hope it keeps them afloat through this COVID period. It's back to Southwest Airlines for me where travel credits are easily provided, the flight attendants actually serve you and Southwest keeps the middle seats empty for better distancing. United is after your dollars; Southwest is trying to ensure you return and feel safe by providing exceptional service and understanding."
Sep 2020,10,Jerking me around with lost suitcase,"It was just a 64 minute flight on Friday September 11 from San Francisco to San Diego. United managed somehow to lose my suitcase.    These things happen but their dealing is unacceptable For 5 days Ive been calling them every day without success. They answer like a robot that they are still looking for it. Every day I get an automatic email suggesting their team is still looking for my bag.    They seem to make it torture to resolve the case. Say you lost it - they dont. Allow me to speak with an agent in San Francisco someone who would be on my case - no we cant do that.    Allow me to send a picture of the suitcase - no we cant process it.    They say in their sight you may be eligable for 1500$ compensation if they did not find suitcase in 5 days. Ya so they wrote, so what. File a claim on site and in 6 weeks maybe we send a check.    Dear UA - It is so simple to assign person as a case manager someone who would follow a case thru. They dont seem to care.    Dear United I'm willing to be dragged out of a plane by security guards if it will help me know what happened to my dear suitcase.    If you cant find it say its lost and compensate. Dont give me the run around."
Sep 2020,10,I'd rather walk than fly United,"I did not even get to complete my flight because United decided to take the liberty of cancelling it for me. When I called to have them put me on a different flight they told me they were sorry there are no other flights that day. You mean to tell me all these other flights, with your partner American Airlines who you have to transfer me to if you cancel my flight for non-weather related reasons, magically do not exist. I informed them of my need to travel on the specific day and they just said ""sorry"" and continued to do NOTHING. I asked for a flight with a different end destination like PNS, ""Oh we cannot do that"". YES YOU CAN. THAT IS YOUR JOB. I knew UA was a mistake but I figured with airlines hurting and the ticket being inexpensive, maybe they were trying at least a little bit and for one way it could not be that bad. YEAH RIGHT! never again."
Sep 2020,10,No distancing on United!,"United has taken the appalling stance of filling up their flights during this time. While other airlines have protected their customers by keeping the middle seat empty. They are putting their own bottom line ahead of everyone’s health. I keep saying I will never fly them again but every few years, I forget how awful they are."
Sep 2020,10,"PDX-IAH If you want a stranger TOUCHING you during COVID, book a flight on UA!","We flew from PDX Portland to IAH Houston on September 13, in the midst of the Oregon wildfires. This leg was booked on the UA website for $129. I am a Million Miler and Lifetime Platinum member and we were able to select the Exit Row 21D and 21F, leaving the middle open. At the time of booking and even 24 hours, the premium economy section was wide open with many empty seats. However, every seat was miraculously filled by the time we took off.    All the UA staff we encountered at the PDX airport wore a mask. They boarded Platinum after family with children, military and Global Services. After that, rows were called.    The day we flew on September 13, Oregon was in the middle of one of its worst wildfires so you could see and smell smoke in Portland. Even the airplane was surrounded by haze and smoke.    Inevitably someone took the middle seat between us so we let him have the aisle. It is shocking to see how packed EVERY UA flight is. We flew from IAH to Jackson Hole 2 weeks prior and that flight was completely full as well.    For the entire 4 hour flight, I had this stranger touching me. I couldn't keep 6 inches from him much less 6 feet. How do I sanitize this person? During our entire 2 week trip, being on an airplane made me the most uncomfortable."
Sep 2020,10,IAH-JAC Social Distance? Not a Chance!,"Purchased this leg on the UA website for $183 per person for a direct flight from Houston IAH to Jackson Hole JAC as part of a 2 week road trip to visit several National Parks. I am a Million Miler with Lifetime Platinum Status. I was able to select exit row 21A and 21C for our flight.    At the IAH airport, UA attempted social distancing by opening every other kiosk for bag check and check in. Boarding was by row to help with this aspect as well.    However, after the boarding, this is where UA fails to care about your health. UA's motto is every seat must be occupied and this flight was no exception. Even 24 hours prior, the row where we sat had the middle open but within minutes of the door closing, somehow someone miraculously showed up. Where or how these people come from is beyond me.    I don't understand why they even bother with having check in social distanced when you cannot be 6 inches much less 6 feet from a stranger.    Hand sanitizers were handed out upon boarding and we wiped down our seats. During the flight, bottled water was served along with wrapped up snacks.    On a positive note, when you land at JAC Jackson Hole airport, you land on the tarmac and your first views are of the Teton Mountains. Not a bad way to get off the plane! JAC is a very small airport and our bags came out quickly."
Sep 2020,10,Unaccommodating to those traveling with a disability,"I booked a flight with United last minute to travel for a work trip. I fly often with my ESA, have all of her documents, and have flown Delta, American, Southwest, JetBlue and Alaska. Every airline has been accommodating, helpful and welcoming. United instead chose to force me at checkin to get on a call with someone from the support desk to go over and email all my papers through, when the person at the desk confirmed I had all of my paperwork. As someone with a mental and emotional illness the stress and trauma of having to go through all of this while many others are behind me trying to get through their check in process was horrific. They would not let me fly with my ESA instead charged me a pet fee and forced her to sit on the ground in the cabin. Neither of us has ever flown like this. I’ve never been so disrespected and discriminated against while traveling first class with my ESA. I’ll never fly United again. Their customer service is non existent."
Sep 2020,10,CEO of my sneaker palace,I recommend anyone to use different airline then United. The agent booked the wrong flight ticket and they made me pay for it again
Sep 2020,30,Crowded,Good Afternoon: I just flew from Guam to Colorado Springs. The flight from HI to Denver was PACKED. There was absolutely no social distancing. Am very alarmed that you would pack a plane during a pandemic. I understand that you don’t make money flying planes that are not full. But you have made money from us for years. If people start getting sick and passing away because they were on full planes.....what then? I have a photo to prove how full it was.  I took a covid test prior to leaving Guam..... did all of the hundreds who were on that packed plane?    Note: I sent this to UA on 8/15 . No response.
Sep 2020,30,Aug - UA4015 Knoxville to Chicago O’Hare EMB-145 (#N17159) E+ Seats 18C & D,"Aug - UA4015 Knoxville to Chicago O’Hare EMB-145 (#N17159) E+ Seats 18C & D    On Thursday, August 27, we flew United Airlines UA4015, on an EMB-145 (#N17159) from Knoxville (TYS) to Chicago O’Hare (ORD), to overnight, before connecting to our flight home to Phoenix (PHX). This flight was operated by ExpressJet Airlines, dba United Express. We had seats 18C & D, which are deemed as Economy Plus, and are the Exit Row seats.    We started out at Ruby Tuesday in the TYS (Knoxville - Tyson/McGhee Airport, for some wine, prior to our flight to Chicago, after a week at Blackberry Farm in Walland, TN. On the way to our gate, Gate 11 (moved from Gate 9), at the end of the concourse, we spent time with an art display, which had changed. On our previous flight in February, it had been removed, with only empty space, but now there was a new exhibit, and worth the time to browse - glad that we had allowed a bit of extra time, though we were the only passengers in line for TSA Security. The Tennessee Marketplace store, across from Ruby Tuesday had reopened, after being closed for a remodel. The Smoky Mountain TravelMart store, landside in the terminal, was also open. Starbucks was open, but the adjacent Quiznos Subs/Cinnabon were closed. We find TYS to be a great little airport, and enjoy flying into, and out of it, which we do, several times per year.    TYS was good with the masking, and social distancing, and we only saw one person without a mask - he was getting onto our flight, and I was surprised, that the flight attendant had not insisted that he put one on, especially as they had a box of them, on the jetbridge - though as folk were changing seats (the flight was only about 1/4 full), maybe he had just taken his off, when seated? Still, as it was made very clear, a mask MUST be worn at all times, unless actively eating, or drinking, and then must be put back on.    One change at the gate, was the addition of a plexiglas shield at the counter, between the Gate Agent and the passengers. Also, there were several signs with the new regulations, and a lot more hand sanitizing stations, in the concourse, and especially near each gate.    Our plane had arrived early, and to Gate 9, but was then cleaned and sanitized, and moved over to Gate 11, where it was waiting for us.    We boarded on-time, and this time, where Global Services usually boards (after disabilities and active military), but the boarding order is now from the rear of the plane forward. Being in Row 18, we would still have been in the first group, so no difference. We took our seats in the Exit Row. We like these, as on the EMB-145, as they provide extra legroom. Boarding early has advantages, and one needs those on an EMB-145, as there are overhead bins only on the starboard side of the plane - no bins on the port side, at all, so everyone has to use those above the C & D seats. Now, the EMB-145 is configured 1-2, for the entire cabin. The aisle is also about 2"" lower, than the level that the seats are on, so a “step-up.” Add in that the overhead bins (and air duct on the port side) hang low, one is very likely to bump their head, getting into, or out of the seat. We fly EMB-145's too often, and I am just not a big fan of this ship (or the similar CRJ-200 either).    When we boarded, the flight attendant handed out a packet of sanitizer wipes to each passenger, for cleaning any surfaces. This had been the case on our two previous flights on this trip.    As the flight was probably only about 1/4 full, the FA announced that folk could change seats, if desired. Though masks were required, we noticed two, who moved, had taken theirs off. I assume that when they spread out into the empty seats aft of ours, they put them back on? Otherwise, everyone was complying with the regulations.    Because of the small fuselage, the curvature cuts into legroom from the side, on the A and D seats. We talked about swapping seats, with my wife seated at the window, due to the lousy weather, so very little photography, but did not on this flight. The shade in the Exit Row window of this plane, did retract all of the way down, unlike many, which will only go down about half way. The cover for the Exit panel was loose on our side, and the one on the port side of the aircraft actually can undone, just before landing at ORD - but as it was only the cover, no harm done. The tray table at 18D also sagged on the right hinge, so would not stay level. Also, the headliner, just in front of us, had become detached - EMB-145 #N17159 needs a bit of TLC.    One of the good things about the EMB-145's, it is that on the starboard (C & D) side, there are only two braces for the seats in front, so the width of the underseat storage is a bit wider, than on some larger planes. Note that the distance from the floor, to the seat bottom in front of you, is much less, than on a larger plane. Also, the limited overhead bins are shallow, and their opening not very large - not much will fit. Note also, that unlike on many types of aircraft, the overhead bin doors drop down, and do not lift up. This catches many off guard, as they are not used to these ships. My wife’s small, wheeled briefcase will not fit in the overhead bin, because it is about ½"" too thick, but will fit under the seat - but just barely. My small briefcase will fit in the overhead bins, with just barely enough room to fold my blazer, and place it atop the briefcase. The overhead bins are very tiny.    As with our previous flights, there was no copy of Hemispheres Magazine, in the seatback pocket, and only the Safety Card.    On this flight, there was one passing of the beverage cart, down the very narrow aisle. With our status, we would have gotten wine/alcohol at no charge, but declined, and especially as we were in the Exit Row, so only went with bottled water.    We departed from the gate exactly on-time, but then before the taxiway, the pilot shut down the engines. He made an announcement about the delay, but we did not hear it, in the rear of the aircraft. We found out that it was due to a ground-hold at ORD, so we were delayed about 30 mins. We did not have a connection at ORD, until the next morning, so were not impacted. However, as we were getting out before Hurricane (by then Tropical Storm) Laura was heading toward Tennessee, we were hoping to not have issues, as there were no more flights that day.    Because of UA changing so many flights, and especially the legs between PHX and ORD, then to/from TYS, we did a lot of overnighting on this trip. Flying at this point in time is a real exercise in logistics, but I am starting to earn a bunch of Hilton points, after about 6 mos. of zero travel.  We took off on Runway 23L, and were very quickly up into the haze, then clouds. I noticed many United planes in storage, along an outer taxiway, plus a few Delta ships, as well. We skirted some thunderstorms up to ORD, then approached from the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, with a flyby of downtown Chicago, but with the clouds, and heavy haze, there was not much to see. I should have swapped seats with my wife, as there is more leg/foot room on the aisle, than at the window - not a good flight (though a good flight path) for photography, but we were out, before the really bad weather hit.    We arrived at ORD only about 15 mins. late, and that was after the ground-hold, plus dodging thunderstorms, so the pilot made up a bit of time. We still had plenty of time to gather our luggage, check into the Hilton O’Hare, just across the street from the United Baggage Claim, and get to dinner at the Gaslight Club, in the hotel.    A nice flight, though in an aircraft that we dislike flying, and also one showing its age. I only hope that before our December trip to Blackberry Farm, United adds the CRJ-550's back to the ORD-TYS route, but we’ll just make do with the EMB-145's, if not."
Sep 2020,30,Inconsistent Experiences,"Last time I flew United they exceeded expectations and made American Airlines whom I was used to using look bad. This time they did worse than American had ever. My flight times were changed twice, one of my flights was canceled and had to get re-booked, then when it came time to fly we had delays. Very stressful. Overall the inflight experience was great. Plane half full and good service and staff. I also was upset we had to pay to check a small suitcase that would easily fit in carry on because they said we could only have one bag, her purse so we had to check the 2nd one."
Sep 2020,30,"Flight itself was good, but annoying process to get there","Began with changing our flight times and not alerting us. I just happened to check it a couple of weeks before and noticed that our flight time had changed by over THREE HOURS. I assume I would have noticed when they emailed me about checking in 24 hours before, but they should have alerted us right when it happened. It changed our plans drastically.    Checking in was annoying... why have us pre-pay for checked bags and check-in online 24 hours before, but then we have to stand in line to get the tags for our bags? American Airlines lets you print off the tags from kiosks and hand off bags without waiting in line, a lot more efficient for us that have pre-paid for everything.    Flight itself was fine. I wish they enforced the masks more, a lot of people wore them around their chin and necks, defeating the purpose. However, all flights were on time and the plane itself seemed clean."
Sep 2020,10,My experience was horrible.,"I understand that flights change and flexibility is a virtue. However, I did not receive an email or text advising me that my itinerary (which I had received a month in advance) was now fiction. (the day before I was travelling) When I went online to check in I discovered that my new itinerary added 7 and 1/2 hours of travel time to the day. With layovers of 7 hours. The customer service person advised there must have been a 'glitch' in the system which explained why I received no notification. She could not as much as comp my bag fee. I rebooked with Delta and cancelled my flight and do not plan to ever use United again."
Sep 2020,40,Aug - UA1995 Phoenix to Chicago 737-900ER (#3824) FC Seats 3A & B,"Aug - UA1995 Phoenix to Chicago 737-900ER (#3824) FC Seats 3A & B    On Friday, August 21, we flew United Airlines UA1995 from PHX to ORD on a 737-900ER (#33824 - was scheduled to be #3811) in First Class, seats 3A & B. This was the first leg of a leisure trip to Blackberry Farm, in Walland, TN, so we were flying into Knoxville Airport (TYS), as our final destination, the next morning. In the COVID era, the flights were limited, hence our need to overnight at ORD, and fly into TYS the next day.    This was our first flight, since early March, and much had changed. Since our previous flight to ORD, United had moved their operations to the redone Terminal 3 at PHX, and about the time that we had gotten used to those changes, COVID hit, and our flying ceased, until this flight. With the changes, it was like starting over again. First, there was no curbside luggage check-in, so we were into the terminal. All went very well, and we saw a few of the folk we have come to know, with United, in all of our flying into, and out of PHX, our home airport. That was nice, as we had no idea of how many might still be with United. Both check-in, and baggage drop-off went well. For some reason, we were unable to print out our boarding passes from the UA App, and this problem continued for the entire trip? Not sure of what the issue was, but we had never encountered it before. We were up the escalator to the TSA Security area, and with essentially no lines, were off to our gate, E3 very quickly. The Clear line was open, and the agent gave us a little bag with a mask (not needed, as we had ours) wipes, and hand sanitizer. The new United Club will be right there, but it did not look like any work had been done on it, since March. No dates on its opening were available. Everyone, who we observed in the airport was wearing their masks, and most staying a good distance from others.    Gate E3 is quite spacious, with plenty of seating, and also lots of AC outlets for charging devices. Not much was open on the E Concourse, which was similar to what we encountered in March, except that then, the restaurants and bars were still under construction. Now, they were closed.    I approached the Gate Agent, to inquire about the boarding order, and was informed that for us (Global Services), we would board, immediately after those with disabilities, and active military, just as before, though the new general boarding order was for those in the rear of the plane, forward, otherwise. Well, that was not to be. The same agent decided that all First Class passengers would board last. When the First Class passengers were called, it was only the two of us. All others had just boarded when they could get into the line - with “social distancing.” Fine, as we only needed overhead space for my wife’s small, rolling briefcase, and there was just that, near Row 3 - but not much more. This 737-900 was one of the newer planes, and from the United side of the merger with Continental, with the newer, larger overhead bins, and the “Dreamliner” lighting. I did not see a seating chart on the monitors, but the rear of the plane looked pretty full, and FC was completely full, with 4 people getting FC upgrades.    When we entered the plane, we were welcomed, and handed sanitizing wipes for all surfaces. Our UA App had also stated that our plane was being disinfected, prior to boarding, and as it had arrived earlier, there was plenty of time for that process. Notice that ALL passengers MUST wear masks, except when seated and drinking, or eating, was given on all monitors, and via signs around the gate area - it appeared that everyone was complying, and UA had plenty of spare masks.    We were in our seats, and were offered bottled water for the pre-departure beverage. One thing, which I noticed, was that there was no copy of Hemispheres Magazine, in the seatback pocket, and only the Safety Card.    For the first time I can remember, we took off on Runway 26 (have landed on it several times), so were headed west. We did a turn over Glendale, and vectored toward Chicago. We had heavy haze, and high clouds, and were soon into those, until well after mid-flight - no views of the Painted Desert, or the Mississippi River.    The flight was smooth, into ORD, where we flew past the airport, out over Lake Michigan, and then back over the city and shoreline, for our final into ORD.    Beverage service was very limited, as was the food offering - a Bistro-on-Board “Classic” snack box, which consisted of a cheese spread (not all that bad), crackers, a Slim-Jim-like beef stick, almonds, Deep River potato chips and M&M’s. The wines were the Camelot CA Chardonnay, or a Woody Cape SA Shiraz, and both in the little plastic 0.175 bottles, served in plastic cups. These are the same wines, that have been served on United Express flights for some years now, and just OK, like the Classic snack box.    The purser had our jackets hung in the closet, forward, and across from the galley. The seat width is very good, as is the legroom. This 737-900 had 5 rows in First Class, in a 2-2 configuration. The FC seats are 21"" wide, with a 38"" pitch, which provides plenty of legroom, which was not obstructed by the DirectTV equipment, common on the sCO 737's.    We were several minutes early into ORD, and we arrived at Gate B11 (we were scheduled to arrive at C28), so we did not have far to walk, to the baggage claim area.    Because of the limited flights, we were overnighting at the Hilton O’Hare Hotel, so had a very short walk, from baggage claim.    While we did not see much of the airport, it seemed that a lot of the retail and restaurants were closed. We saw more of ORD, the next morning, for our flight to TYS (Knoxville, TN), and I will report in more detail, in my review of that flight.    Our crew was very good, considering that they were all wearing masks, and usually gloves. Other than the confusion on the boarding scheme at PHX, all UA staff was very nice. The meal and the wines were limitations, but due to these times, so understandable."
Sep 2020,30,Aug - UA3906 Chicago to Knoxville EMB-145 (#N29917) E+ Seats 18C & D,"Aug - UA3906 Chicago to Knoxville EMB-145 (#N29917) E+ Seats 18C & D    On Saturday, August 22, we flew United Airlines flight UA3906, from Chicago O’Hare (ORD), to Knoxville McGhee Tyson (TYS), on a EMB-145 #N29917 (scheduled to be #N15912), operated by ExpressJet Airlines, dba United Express, in E+, seats 18C & D - Exit Row seats. The EMB-145 (and the CRJ-200) are our least favorite ships in the United Express fleet. Originally, we were booked to fly on the new CRJ-550, but with COVID, those planes were moved to the EWR-IAD route, and also many of the flights from ORD to TYS were removed from the schedule, so we had to overnight at the Hilton O’Hare Hotel.    We left the hotel a bit early, not knowing what the crowds would be like at ORD, and walked across the street to the United Global Services check-in counter. We were the only passengers there, and the very friendly staff welcomed us, and had our luggage checked in, quickly. The agent told us about the United Club situation at ORD - only one Club, at B5 was open. From that counter, one is right at the TSA desk, and again - no one there, but the agent. We were immediately through Security, and headed to the United Club near Gate B5. Before this flight, we have enjoyed the little United Club over in the E & F Concourse, but like the one on Concourse C, it was closed. Still, from B5, it was a short walk to our departure gate, F5, which was moved from Gate F3..    ORD requires that all folk wear masks, except when seated, and eating and drinking in the few restaurants, which are still open. When we had arrived the evening before, and on the walk from the B Concourse to Baggage Claim, it appeared that much was closed in the airport. This morning confirmed it, going to B, then over to E & F. A shop here, or a restaurant there, but so much was closed, and especially over in E & F, which serve mostly commuter flights. Everyone, who we saw, was complying with the mask mandate, and there was good signage about the restrictions, all around the airport. One nice thing is that ORD has quite a few signs, instructing passengers what is open, and where. Before our flight, the UA App had sent a message, confirming the mask requirements, plus requirements if one was taking the Metro into the city - though we were not. Social Distancing markers were everywhere in the airport, and almost everyone, we encountered, was taking the distancing seriously.    One of the nice aspects of the walk between Concourse B and E & F is the Terminal 1 & 2 Art Gallery, with lots of colorful benches, and other works of art, much depicting aspects of Chicago’s history. Always worth a stroll, and it’s an easy stroll.    Gate F5 is fairly spacious (some of the gates in E & F are not so), and with comfortable seating, plus lots of AC outlets for charging devices.    The weather was gloomy, with overcast, but no rain. We were very quickly into the clouds, so there was not much to see, all of the way to TYS.    We boarded on-time, and this time, where Global Services usually boards (after disabilities and active military), but the boarding order is now from the rear of the plane forward. Being in Row 18, we would still have been in the first group. We took our seats in the Exit Row. We like these, as on the EMB-145, as they provide extra legroom. Boarding early has advantages, and one needs those on an EMB-145, as there are overhead bins only on the starboard side of the plane - no bins on the port side, at all, so everyone has to use those above the C & D seats. Now, the EMB-145 is configured 1-2, for the entire cabin. The aisle is also about 2"" lower, than the level that the seats are on, so a “step-up.” Add in that the overhead bins (and air duct on the port side) hang low, one is very likely to bump their head, getting into, or out of the seat. We fly EMB-145's too often, and I still hit my head, about every third flight.    When we boarded, the flight attendant handed out a packet of sanitizer wipes to each passenger, for cleaning any surfaces.    Because of the small fuselage, the curvature cuts into legroom from the side, on the A and D seats. We talked about swapping seats, with my wife seated at the window, due to the lousy weather, so very little photography, but did not on this flight. The shade in the Exit Row window of this plane, did retract all of the way down, unlike many, which will only go down about half way. Interestingly, the “Exit Row” sign on the starboard window was much smaller, than the one on the port side of the plane, so obstructed the view less - what view there was.    If there is a bright spot on the EMB-145's, it is that on the starboard (C & D) side, there are only two braces for the seats in front, so the width of the underseat storage is a bit wider, than on some larger planes. Now, that is the ONLY bright side. Note that the distance from the floor, to the seat bottom in front of you, is much less, than on a larger plane. Also, the limited overhead bins are shallow, and their opening not very large - not much will fit. Note also, that unlike on many types of aircraft, the overhead bin doors drop down, and do not lift up. This catches many off guard, as they are not used to these ships. My wife’s small, wheeled briefcase will not fit in the overhead bin, because it is about ½"" too thick, but will fit under the seat - but just barely. My small briefcase will fit in the overhead bins, with just barely enough room to fold my blazer, and place it atop the briefcase. The overhead bins are very tiny. At the gate, the agent insisted that my wife’s briefcase would need to be gate-checked, but as we fly with it in EMB-145's often, we knew that it would go below the seat, and it did. I still took the gate-check stub, rather than argue.    As with our previous flight, the afternoon before, there was no Hemispheres Magazine, in the seatback pocket, and only the Safety Card.    On this flight, there was one passing of the beverage cart, down the very narrow aisle. With our status, we would have gotten wine/alcohol at no charge, but declined, and especially as we were in the Exit Row, so only went with bottled water.    The flight was fairly smooth, and we never did get much clear sky, and picked up more clouds, near TYS. During the flight, we did not encounter rain, though it seemed to be all around us, and especially the closer we got to TYS.    We arrived about 15 mins. early, at Gate 11, but with no connecting flight, this was not an issue - our driver monitored the flight closely.    The gate crew at ORD was very good, and the flight attendant, was quite friendly. We were ahead of schedule, so other than the model of the plane, we had a very nice, and short flight."
Sep 2020,40,Aug - UA343 Chicago O’Hare to Phoenix 737-800SFP (#3509) FC Seats 2E & F,"Aug - UA343 Chicago O’Hare to Phoenix 737-800SFP (#3509) FC Seats 2E & F    On Friday, August 28, we flew UA343 from Chicago (ORD) home to Phoenix (PHX) on a 737-800SFP (#3509, changed from #3526), in First Class, seats 2E & F. The weather in Chicago was cloudy, but with a forecast for worsening, so we were glad to be getting out early. We had done an overnight at the Hilton O’Hare Hotel, attached to Terminal 1, so walked over with plenty of time to spare. We checked in at the Global Services office, as we had been unable to print our boarding passes, either from the App, or from the UA Website. This was an issue we had for all four flights on this trip. We walked out to the TSA line, and found no one there, so waltzed through, with even more time on our hands. The staff at Global Services informed us that only the United Club at B5 was open, but we had stopped in there, on our earlier flight from ORD to TYS, so knew the disposition of the UA Clubs at ORD - at least one was open!    We headed to our departure gate, C-28 (moved from C-26), and stopped into the Berghoff Café, near the gate for wine. We had walked past it many, many times, and I remembered a very good meal at their Berghoff Restaurant in the Loop downtown, so we stopped in, and were glad that we did.    Throughout the airport, it seemed that all folk were complying with the masking mandate, except when dining/drinking, and all were doing a fair job at social distancing. There were reminders everywhere, and decals on the floor, wherever people might congregate. United had many signs about, and also included information on their sanitizing efforts after the safety video, which was one of the older versions (pre-Spider Man), with a few edits - Oscar Munoz (now CEO of Continental Holdings - UA’s parent company) had been edited out, and there were a few other, minor changes to it.    As the boarding process had differed on the previous flights on this trip, we headed to the gate a bit early. Unlike at PHX, where the trip began, boarding was normal, through Global Services. Then, boarding was from the rear of the plane forward. I never did see a monitor with the seating chart, but think that the plane was only about 3/4 full, and 8 people had been upgraded to First Class.    When we boarded, the crew greeted us with sanitizing wipes, which we used to again wipe down surfaces. All crew, and all passengers, who we observed, were masked, and kept their distances pretty well.    This particular 737-800SFP was from the Continental side of the merger, and had both the old interior, with the smaller overhead bins, and also DirectTV. The one drawback of DirectTV is that the equipment takes up a lot of underseat real estate, but my small briefcase, and hat fit OK. My wife’s small, wheeled briefcase fit easily in the large overhead bins. As there was likely little to be seen outside my window, I was glad to have the DirectTV, and hoped that it worked for the entire flight, which it did. Though showing signs of wear, everything functioned on this 3+ hr flight down to Phoenix, and home for us.    The United 737-800SFP (738) is comfortable in First Class, with 4 rows of 2-2 seats, with a pitch of 38"" and a width of 21"". Now, as mentioned, the DirectTV equipment does occupy some of the foot well, but still the pitch is adequate. We are less fond of the First Class in the 737's, and prefer what United did, when they refurbished their AirBus fleet, with completely new seats in the First Class cabin.    Pre-departure beverage service consisted of bottled water.    We took off on time, and were soon into the clouds. During the flight, we were served a snack, with a choice this time, we opted for the “Classic” and the “Tapas” boxes, both of which had been featured on the Bistro-on-Board menu, for Economy/Economy Plus, prior to COVID. We had only the Classic, on our PHX-ORD flight, the week before. Both are OK, but the Tapas is the better, in our opinion. For early flights, UA once had a very good Smoked Turkey Sandwich in the Bistro-on-Board lineup, and when available, we’d often choose that, though we were in First Class - unfortunately, we have not seen that in a few years.    The Tapas snack had:  Olives  Humus  Flatbread  Bruschetta Sauce  Parmesan Cheese Spread  Almonds  Gin-gin Candy (very sticky, and a good way to pull a crown, or filling)    The Classic had:  Cheese spread (not all that bad)  Crackers  A Slim-Jim-like beef stick  Almonds  Deep River potato chips  M&M’s    We opted for the Camelot California Chardonnay, in a little 0.175 plastic bottle.    We picked up heavy clouds, just out of Chicago, and did not get a break, until over Colorado, but then there was haze and smoke, which was not unexpected, given the fires in CO, CA and AZ. Not much scenery. Even our “fly-over” of Phoenix was in heavy haze and smoke.    We approached Phoenix a bit to the West of our usual route, then flew out over Glendale, before turning back East, for an approach onto Runway 8, so with but a short taxi, we were quickly at T3 North, and gate E-3.    The flight was nice, and uneventful, with a friendly, efficient crew, and well-behaved passengers. For only our fourth flight, since mid-March, a nice one, and it appeared that United was doing quite a bit, to keep passengers safe.  Our luggage came up quickly on Carousel 3, and we were headed home."
Sep 2020,10,Terrible non-English-speaking customer service,"My international flight for which I paid for premium economy was cancelled and all they could offer was to put me on another airline at basic economy at the same price!  No offer of an upgrade or remittance! And it was very difficult to understand the  non-English-speaking customer ""service"" people."
Sep 2020,10,Worse service ever,"Had my flight canceled twice but was never notified. Then on day of return I checked online 6hrs ahead, then 2, then 1, before getting to the airport. It said on time every time. Get to the airport, it's late, so I'll never make my connection in Denver. No text notice no email notice, and when I pointed this out many times all i got was, gee so sorry, you should have.  Will you pay for hotel since I have to wait 24 hours for next flight. No.  Will never ever book with United again."
Sep 2020,10,Refund expected from United Airlines,"#unitedAIRLINES you told us ""we received the refund request, wait 27 working days"", but still nothing 3 months later !!! Please give me my money back as promised. #THIEF"
Sep 2020,10,BATE AND SWITCH AND THE RUN AROUND,"I bought a plane ticket from Dallas to Toronto as I was going for an operation. When purchasing the ticket I clicked the travel insurance with the cancellation and refund policy. I called to cancel my ticket (as I had some complications) and they said it was an insurance claim. Insurance said it was Uniteds problem. So now I have a non transferable, non refundable ticket to Toronto. No where on the website or ticket I bought, said it was non refundable or transferable. No one should have to deal with this nonsense when recovering from major surgery. Its really horrendous that they would treat people this way especially during these tough covid times. United should be ashamed of themselves for false advertising and how they treat their customers."
Sep 2020,10,Worst and most rude customer service representative,"I was trying to apply a future flight credit to book a flight together for my wife and I in order for us both to get TSA precheck because we would be on a tight schedule to make our flight in time in order to make my brother's wedding. After explaining this to the representative she stated ""Are you trying to tell me how to do my job of 37 years."" I very calmly responded no but this is an extremely rude comment to made. She answered very sarcastically ""Well I am sorry you feel that way."" After asking for her name she ignored me and asked if she could help book the flight. I said that would be great but I would like to know her name first. She again ignored me and told me that she would be unable to help me and I would have to finish the booking online. Again, I asked if I could have her name and she she said it looks like we are unable to help you today and hung up on me. I understand that this is a high stress environment due to covid but I work in the service industry as well and would never treat someone with such level of disrespect. I have only had poor experiences with United throughout the previous year and will never consider flying with them again."
Sep 2020,10,United Airlines is dangerous - Stay away,"Flying United Airlines is dangerous and they don't care about your safety or health. they put profits over passengers. The flight I was on was 100% full, no empty middle seats, no social distancing whatsoever. Many of the passengers didn't even have on masks. I got off the flight because I was not going to put my health at risk for Covid. It was astounding and unconscionable that they would not fly at a lesser capacity to assure the safety of their customers. Clearly greed was more important than my life as a paying customer. I will never fly United again. I was forced to lose a day of work, to get rebooked on a less full flight but even then they said it was just the roll of the dice and if it filled up, tough luck. They were taking no precautions whatsoever for our safety and protection in terms of the crowded flights. They said they wiped the plane down but shouldn't they do that anyway? And don't they know that Covid is airborne. Shaking my head in disbelief and outrage. They didn't even offer a hotel voucher and refused when I asked. So I was asked to either spend more money, miss work and be inconvenienced or risk my life and health to fly on a small, packed plane with no social distancing and a serious lack of wearing masks because they are too greedy to schedule additional flights so they can fly with a less crowded plane. It ended costing me twice as much as the ticket I originally purchased to be safe. That was not my experience on Delta , Jet Blue or Southwest where the flights respected some social distancing and they were strict about mask wearing."
Sep 2020,10,Terrible Pilots,this is the second time I have been in the middle of the trip and the pilots have either had to land or turn around on the runway for gas mid trip. I am not sure where they shop for their pilots but mus bee goodwill brother because a pilot and co pilot could not start off with the correct amount of gas. Thank God their hand me down noticed.
Sep 2020,20,Ms.,"The first flight was fantastic. I flew from SLC to Chicago in first class. I was the first to board and was offered a drink as soon as I sat down. The second flight was horrible. For purchasing and spending a great deal of money on a first class ticket I expected a lot more. When they called people to the gate, they started with the back of the plane first. I didn’t mind this because I figured it was because of Covid and they didn’t want people piled at the front. I was one of the last passengers to get on, and I am in first class. When I walked in the plane, the flight attendant waived a wipe in front of my face rudely instead of gretting me and handing it to me. I sat in the first class chair for at least 25 min or more and I was not offered a drink. No one should be treated differently no matter what class of ticket they have, but why did I spend this much if the service was not to standard?"
Sep 2020,40,Well treated by Staff. Cleanliness AAA+,Enjoyed flight going. Coming back we got sent to Philadelphia due to storm. Not their fault kept us comfortable
Sep 2020,10,Never Again,"United Airlines is the worst company that I have ever done business with. Even with the world being in a pandemic I still couldn't get my money back. I was told repeatedly that I didn't qualify (even tho we are in a pandemic) for a refund. My trip was cancelled due to the fact that Vegas shut down due to the pandemic. United refused to give me my money back, instead they wanted me to have a voucher, which I didn't want because I didn't know when would be the next time I traveled. I will never ever, ever use united airlines again. They are completely unreasonable and have the worst customer service ever. I will stick to my normal company(SOUTHWEST). Oh, and by the way I didn't mention that this was my first time ever using United."
Sep 2020,50,Wonderful airline,United Airlines was wonderful. My boyfriend is in a wheelchair and they treated him great and made sure to help him and get where we needed. They even went as far as holding a flight for us in Denver because our first flight was delayed. We were very happy with everyone and appreciated everyone's help.
Sep 2020,40,First Flight during COVID-19,"This was my first flight during the COVID-19 and I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the plane was and how they gave you wipes to clean your area when you sit down. They kept all middle seats empty, and the flight was not overbooked. This experience made me comfortable to fly again."
Sep 2020,20,They are RUDE AND LIE,I was flying from Florida to LA with a stop Houston. I got that txt alert the the plane was nearing full and when I called in they said that meant 50%. I asked if it was still a set between guest the lady said yes and my first flight Proved this was true. My 2nd flight was 100% FULL when I talk to the flight attendant she was extremely RUDE 😡 about it. Needles to say I got of the plane spoke to the supervisor who was clam and level headed helped talk me me and hurd what I had to say then helped me get on a new flight THIS IS THE ONLY REASON FOR 2 ⭐️ . The next morning for my flight the lady at the desk asked me if I was going to be ok with a full flight I said yes. However last night they said it would not be did it change in the last 8hrs? She then reasponed with ARE YOU GOING TO BE AN ISSUE 😧. Rude yet again! I don’t know what’s wrong with these flight attendants but they need a lesson in empathy and how to Appropriately speak to people. Needles to say I WILL NOT FLY UNITED AGAIN.
Aug 2020,50,Good flights in spite of Covid==-19,"In spite of the Covid-19 restrictions, we had extremely good flights (Quito-Houston-Chicago-Omaha). The airline went out of its way to ensure safety. We had zero problems with luggage, seating, service or interaction with United staff. All in all, a surprisingly good experience."
Aug 2020,40,January 2020 Flight from Los Angeles to Bangkok,"Let me first say I booked this entire flight through United Airlines. The flight had 4 legs or portions. The first was covered by a United Airlines airplane and staff, the other 3 portions were Ana Airlines.    The check-in and boarding process was very easy to complete on my arrival to Los Angeles Airport (LAX). The staff was easy to deal with and helped me to self check in at a podium (I am old fashion so I do not really like self check-in). The boarding process was logical and efficient and we left on time. I bring a cushion to sit on, so the flight was comfortable. Note: If I did not have a cushion to sit on the seat would of been very uncomfortable.    The Pros:    1. Staff was helpful and efficient.  2. Boarding was straight forward and efficient.  3. Plane left and arrived on time.    The Cons:    1. The self check-in is not what I like. I like human interaction and explanation. Although staff did direct me to the self check-in I wish there had been a option to check-in with a human being.  2. The seat was very uncomfortable and dated.  3. The space available in the seat on the plane was very small. I am 5'11"" tall and it seemed very small for me.    Tips: Bring a seat cushion. With a seat cushion the uncomfortable seat was just fine and I was comfortable due to the cushion. Bring your own head phones and a plane adapter. The headphones given to me by United were subpar and very uncomfortable. Check in early."
Aug 2020,10,Justin A. The worst customer service experience of any company in my life,"Justin A. On the check in counter tried everything to ruin our vacation to Brazil to see my spouse's family. Justin A., despite your active efforts at being the worst at customer service and your job on the planet, we managed to work with someone else at United to fix your incomptency and we're now in Brazil.    Justin A. Said because my middle name was combined with my last name in their system, he couldn't check me in. So we're calling the travel agency we booked with to figure out what to do for hours before the flight.    The travel agency said it looks right on their end and they have never had this problem before. They said Justin is obviously incompetent, so just get out of SLC AND GET TO A DIFFERENT AIRPORT with a United worker with a brain. So we luckily convinced him to print the ticket we had paid for to Houston. In Houston the United workers fixed everything that Justin refused to help us with.    United, if you ever want to be respected by customers, you need to remove people like Justin A. From your company. I wish i remembered his last name, I'm sure you know tho. Slicked back grey hair, 40s, endlessly presents problems and refuses to do his job, probably lives with his mother still."
Aug 2020,10,united airlines is horrible,They put us on a fully packed plane in these difficult time DO NOT FLY WITH THEM. They made promises of caring about safety and health that is clearly not the case
Aug 2020,10,I'm writing this for my spouse,"on August 25th, was overcharged for a slightly overweight bag, do to their scale not working properly. Charged 800$ for supposedly 1 lbs. Over. Won't refund the money after finding out the scale is faulty. She loves their nonstop flight to Montego Bay, Jamaica, but will not fly united again. We have the agents name and that is G.G. she was very unprofessional and cursed at my wife, who was trying to be as courteous as possible."
Aug 2020,40,Not a bad flight:),Staff was very professional and friendly and seemed to like their job. The plane was very clean compared to my other flights that week. I'd definitely book flights with them again.
Aug 2020,40,Wow... alot of attitudes with other reviews,"First... despite other reviews SCREAMING that the plane is packed and there is no social distancing... UNITED has already stated they were going to fill all seats on busy routes. NEXT... there is a clause on your ticket AND they inform you in advance, if the plane is liable to be crowded and allow you to pick another option. I FIND IT UNBELIEVABLE HOW PEOPLE TWIST FACTS OR DON""T PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS GOING ON. (whew!).  The seats are comfortable, they give you a snack, the flight was on time both ways, the price was reasonable."
Aug 2020,30,Pretty easy flight,"It was our first flight during the coronavirus pandemic.    O’Hare airport was busier than we thought, and I was surprised that United had not done more in its gate areas to encourage social distancing, such as putting signage on chairs to encourage people to sit apart. Most of the signage was branding stuff advertising United’s “cleanPlus” program rather than stuff that actually encouraged the public to distance.    Our flight was booked near full. We did get a text asking if we wanted to book an alternative flight, but when you clicked to look at alternative options, there were no other alternatives!    The check-in kiosk seemed designed to maximize the number of times you had to click; you had to make it through several pages attempting to up-sell you things such as more mileage and priority boarding. The priority boarding piece is annoying: due to coronavirus, United is not offering priority boarding; they are boarding by rows from back-to-front. No complaints about that boarding process, but why are you still selling priority boarding on your kiosks when you don’t even offer it?    The boarding agent was rude. Due to coronavirus, you have to self-scan your boarding pass; that’s fine. But she could have said “have a nice flight” or “thanks;” instead, she just stared forward and said nothing.    On-board, it was fine. The aircraft was clean, and you were given a sanitizing wipe on boarding to wipe down your armrest, etc., which was a nice gesture. Service was limited; you were given a little bag with a bottle of water, a wipe, cookies, and chips. The chips were completely disgusting and tasted like chemicals; the cookies were good.    The flight attendants were VERY nice. However, the flight attendant working the coach cabin had an ill-fitting mask that kept dipping beneath her nose. Hardly a model of safe travel; can United really not provide its employees masks that actually fit their faces?"
Aug 2020,10,United DON’T Care about the health and safety of passengers,"When I sat in my seat, the attendant said “You’re the lucky one.” I did not feel lucky at all. I felt embarrassed as passengers looked at me. I was not given an explanation as to why the seat was broken or even why the seat cushion was flipped upside down. The demeanor of the attendant was not one that reflected excellent customer service. I was not given an apology as to me having to sit next to this disgusting seat. I asked the attendant if there was something she could cover the seat with and she said she could bring ME a couple of trash bags..... Unbelievable. With COVID... this is how they treat their customers.... with or without COVID. I took pictures at the beginning and end of my flight and the attendant asked me if I took her picture. I said “I did not, they should know who’s on the plane.” Customer Care continued to lie about the situation and continued to give me the runaround and/or tell me there’s nothing they can do. 4 months later they came back and said the attendant coved the seat with a “first class blanket” and the seat was repaired right after my flight. It was scheduled for maintenance that day..... OMG, what lies. Why couldn’t they have told me that in February, March, April or any other month that I asked. I asked United 3 questions: was the passenger in that seat Sick, why was the seat flipped over, and why was I “the lucky one”. With COVID, I felt those were valid questions. United then told a reporter that they are taking extra cleaning measures due to COVID. Another lie. They were not hard questions to answer and when they did answer the questions.....they lied. I did nothing wrong, and yet United made me feel VERY devalued as a customer."
Aug 2020,10,Doesn’t care that we are in COVID at all!!,"During the mist of COVID, the flight from Phoenix to Chicago they book the whole plane out!!! There was supposed to be a space in between people!!!! There wasn’t!!!!! We were packed in the plane like sardines. I will never be flying United again. We are only flying Southwest! United you have lost my business. Hopefully my family doesn’t get COVID because of you."
Aug 2020,10,Packed in like sardines,"No social distancing, whatsoever. Masks are (kind of ) required. If you happen to just not wear a mask however, a United employee will just pretend they don't notice even after speaking to you directly multiple times. Definitely do not fly with United during the pandemic because they literally do not care about your safety at all. I couldn't help but scoff when they mentioned how much they care about your safety and putting it first. Hilarious."
Aug 2020,10,Don’t Believe the change fee hype,"United speaks as if they are doing something special by waiving change fees. Right now ALL AIRLINES are waiving change fees. The hypocrisy comes in where if you change to a flight that costs more, naturally you would expect to pay the difference. But if that flight is less, shouldn’t you expect the difference in a credit/refund? American Airlines can apply that common sense, but United (being greedy as usual) absorbs all that is left. That’s as immoral as it comes. Wrote United, and got a reply back of the normal cookie cutter too bad,    ""We appreciate you taking time to share your thoughts about our ticket change policy.  We're sorry you are disappointed, and your comments are very helpful to us in understanding how to improve your travel experience.  We look forward to working toward the suggestions you've mentioned, and to welcoming you aboard your next flight.""    So back to American Airlines I go."
Aug 2020,50,Great experience on a long haul flight,"Our family returned to Canada from Australia during covid. We were anxious to fly with our kids during this time but had to get home. We had an excellent experience on our long haul flight. The flight was less than half full, we had our own rows so could lay down. The plane was clean and very comfortable. The flight attendants were the best we've ever had (we have flown all over the world with our kids). They were friendly, attentive, and so kind to our kids. They genuinely made us feel like they were happy to have us on board. We were fed one hot meal (chicken and potatoes with a bun, salad and dessert), a snack and another cold meal just before landing. If you need to get to North America from Australia I highly recommend this flight."
Aug 2020,50,Delta Embaer 175 (00),"I read a review on this aircraft operated by United. I’m sitting in the seat right now. Operated by Delta, Very nice, thick padding and foldable headrest. This is my last leg today, I’m tired, but comfortable. First class “looks “ a bit larger in comparison to larger aircraft."
Aug 2020,10,Literally the worst during COVID,They cancel flights that are not fully booked to fully book others. No social distancing whatsoever. The person next to me was coughing during the entire flight.
Aug 2020,10,Terrible,If I could give United a zero I would. Other airlines like Alaska airlines are doing the responsible thing and eliminating middle seating and flying at reduced capacity. United is flying at full capacity and don’t seem to be too concerned with proper mask wearing. I’m pretty disgusted with how they put money over public health. I will not be flying with them again.
Aug 2020,10,Morally corrupt company,"It is clear United airlines only cares for their profits and will throw morals, sanity, and safety out the window without a parachute during this covid pandemic. During my flight I felt incredibly unsafe even with my mask because of United's terribly greedy policies. They packed 80% of the flight into 20% of the plane space and when I asked to move they repremanded me in front of the whole plane, blaming me for not paying for first class. It was so horrendous that the pilot had to move people to balance the plane and unfortunately I wasn't one of the lucky few chosen. They are risking the safety of all passengers by unbalancing planes and forcing them to sit shoulder to shoulder to spread diseases all to make another few dollars."
Aug 2020,10,Kt,Literally the worst airline I have ever flown with. I usually fly southwest or delta. United treats their customers like absolute garbage. I went to the gate and had a small personal item with exact measurements for basic economy and was forced to check the bag in stating it was too large. So I had to pay 60 dollars to check the bag in! Are you kidding me. Trash airline. Won’t be flying with them ever again.
Aug 2020,10,BROKEN GOLF DRIVER,"had a $150 golf bag suitcase with a hard cover. also a head cover on my driver. careless care from united airline employees, I received my clubs back with a broken head. $450 club broken!!!! also another regular suitcase was also received broken off at the wheel. watched it fall 15 feet off the conveyer belt going into the plane. paid $35 per bag each flight for them to treat our bags like absolute garbage!!! will never fly united airlines again. same with my whole family! will also tell people about my incident and convince them to fly any other way!!"
Aug 2020,10,They will take your money and hang up on you if you have to cancel,"Have had a trip planned for Hawaii for a year. Everything was set and my daughter paid 6000 plus insurance “in case we had to cancel” to fly all of us there through cheap o air, who contracts with United. Due to Covid restrictions we had to cancel our entire trip. The house and the car rental place were understanding and gave us credit. The flights? Apparently both companies feel that it is ok to just steal 6000 plus from a military family. We could not reschedule because my son in law is getting deployed in January and we have no idea how long he will be gone. We were not offered a credit, a refund, nothing. In actuality we got hung up on by both companies multiple times when trying to explain to them. We asked for a higher up at United after being hung up on and she promised a “meeting” but never followed through. At this point we are out 6000 plus and the companies just give you the run around to try to wait out the 30 day policy so they don’t have to give you a refund or credit."
Aug 2020,10,Never again,"WORST FROM TSA TO BOTH FLIGHTS. FOR $800 , NEVER AGAIN. No drinks snacks, on way to Houston . Small old plane back to Memphis, but we get a drink. No consistency. Can't carry bags on from Houston to Memphis, bags go under plane but we can carry on from Memphis to Houston. ALL A JOKE and much more I could add."
Aug 2020,10,Refund nightmare,"My husband and I booked flights to visit England in April 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we could not go ahead with the trip. We spoke to united and because one part of our journey had been dramatically changed, we could get a refund for our trip. I revived this refund and was happy with it until a couple of months later they decided to take back half of the refund and charge me for half of the trip. I called, emailed and spoke with United multiple times and they said I was eligible for a refund. I waited 4 weeks to get a refund, and still I haven’t had one. It’s been 8 months battling with United. I have called up and been on the phone for 45 minutes waiting and then hung up on. I have been promised things and let down. I would NEVER fly with United ever again. I never want to deal with their customer service ever again. I would completely avoid flying United if you want to have a good holiday and not be messed around.    Do not recommend!!"
Aug 2020,10,United Airlines - BEWARE of Economy FARE,"I booked a ticket on Travelocity and paid a regular priced fare (not a discount airline price) and a CARRY -ON was not included, we had to pay another $35 /bag to check it in.......UNITED HAS TURNED INTO A LOW COST AIRLINE but charges the same as Delta and American which a carry on bag is included."
Aug 2020,30,HAWAII,"Boring , people were argueing and about to fight we thought over luggage storage. what a joke. no security to break it up, unless security was just watching. flights are not what they use to be. had free sandwiches on long flights, not today, get your credit cards out and pay pay pay."
Aug 2020,50,Excellent - SFO to New Delhi,My sister and family travelled on the United flight 867 on August 13 from SFO to New Delhi and had a superb and excellent experience. The long almost 16 hour flight was made most comfortable by the friendly and kind cabin crew and flight personnel. Food was served 3 times and was hot and very good. Thank you United for living up to the friendly skies logo.
Aug 2020,40,Very bumpy first 20 minutes but pilot did a great job,"Good flight after a scary, very bumpy first twenty minutes. Pilot did a great job getting us thru the turbulence. Rest of flight fine, service minimal but it's coronavirus time. Flight left a little late because of weather and didn't make up any time. Baggage came on time."
Aug 2020,40,Great Polaris Experience,"The Dreamliner is definitely United's best product internationally, especially in the Polaris seats. Our flight attendants were all super friendly and with great customer service skills. The chicken was terrible, but the steak was pretty good. The seats are super comfortable, with awesome privacy. Definitely the only way to fly on United, and make sure to wear your mask if you're not eating or drinking, the flight attendants will remind you at least 30 times!"
Aug 2020,10,HORRIBLE,"HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. Flight delayed bc of weather, okay. Then because the plane was ‘broke’. No bs. Then we wait with no answers for 6 hours. No food. Everything in airport was closed. No accommodations. No apologies. I will pay extra to fly with Delta next time. CROOKS."
Aug 2020,10,Horrific,I really hope this review hurts United cuz if not I just wasted my time and I hope you all learn from your horrific past experiences with United (which i know you have had) and never use them again.
Aug 2020,10,HORRENDOUS,I have to say this is the WORST airline ever. The flight attendants do not care about anything. Half the people on the plane were not wearing masks and it was jam packed! I mean people were double booked on seats. I have never felt so unsafe during this pandemic. The guy sitting next to us was 100% sick!! He was coughing and sneezing and NOT wearing his mask. The flight attendants passed him several times while his mask was off and didn’t say anything to him. I felt so bad for the mother and daughter that were sitting next to him. She kept looking at me with like “help me” eyes. I’ll be surprised is my coronavirus test comes back negative.
Aug 2020,10,Terrible Service,"Tried to book a flight in a few weeks with a friend, went to grab both tickets at the same time for convenience and it would not let me. So, I purchased the first ticket at one price and then the price went up for the remaining ticket we wanted to buy without any notice whatsoever. This price difference was almost three times the original price of the ticket that was purchased 30 seconds prior. WHAT CROOKS. After called customer service, we were not offered a price match. Naturally, we canceled and will be driving. We will be safer and have piece of mind knowing they do not get our money. This solidified, DELTA FOR LIFE."
Aug 2020,10,"Horrific, unprofessional, no attention to passenger safety","I’ve never flown with United before. This week was my first time. I will fly with Air New Zealand any chance I get. The staff are so disorganised. The overhead lockers were stored with other rubbish so we couldn’t put our things in them. As the flight was about to take off, I was demanded to move “somewhere else you can’t sit here” - even though I was in the seat on my ticket. Then as we were about to land “you can’t sit here!” So I get up and move back to my assigned seat, where I was told to go. Then AGAIN! “Excuse me! You can’t sit here!” I moved seats 4 times! They didn’t even help me with my bag. Their tvs on the backs of the seats constantly replaying the same thing on repeat? Horrible! NEVER AGAIN. Never ever."
Aug 2020,30,Hope you done expect service or more than a water.,If you fly first class with United. Don’t expect to get more than a few options of chips and a water. We had two male flight attendants and they ate hot meals sitting right next to us in fist class seats. Didn’t offer drinks just water and biscuit in a bag. Asked for a cocktail and received it after about 30 minutes. I had remind them twice. I know we have the COVID thing going on and safety first but come on. If you are going to charge three times the cost of an average fair then at least put out an effort. Not flying with them anytime soon. Oh and the next flight into OKC the same. Pathetic service.
Aug 2020,10,They don’t care about health,In a pandemic there was no empty seat what so ever. FRONTIER AIRLINES left every middle seat open unless it was 3 people in the same party. That is responsible and considerate. United’s blatant disregard is unacceptable. They were mediocre for the price before the pandemic now they are downright not worth it.
Aug 2020,10,United is struggling,"United is struggling    763542314    United airlines ruined a fishing trip with guide on a trip to south dakota on Lake Oahe, they had mechanical difficulty and left us in Denver for 4.5 hours without adequate back up which cost me and 5 fraternity brothers who get together about every other year and spend big bucks to go fishing in some remote super fishing spot! We had guides set up and paid for a high end lodge to stay and they caused us to miss a fishing trip scheduled and told us sorry we dont compensate unless its 8 hours or more, asking to be compensated with a future credit since the guide cost us 350.00 and the time missed was invaluable I would consider other options they did this to us when it was really hard to travel and was very difficult to get away with a group."
Aug 2020,40,Very smooth Half empty flight to Atlanta,"Very good half empty flight to Atlanta. Even fewer passengers in economy. Social distancing good. Excellent service, smooth flight. Easy checkin, baggage delivery. Everything you'd want in a safe flight to Atlanta. Everyone wore a mask"
Aug 2020,10,No Social Distancing Protocol 😷,"United is all talk and no walk. They say that they ""care"" about customer safety, while packing people like sardines and allowing people to take off their masks. But the cherry on top of my three hour flight was the rude flight attendant that scoffed at me when I asked him for snacks. United calling seats to deplane row by row is a complete joke after being squished in with 60 or so people. Worst of all, I was carrying my cat with me through all this BS."
Aug 2020,20,Profit over customer,"I flew Delta from MSP to ORD, and back with United. The difference is obvious. As of me writing this review, we are still in the midst of pandemic. Both airline requires face covering. Both claims social distancing.    Delta: waiting area some seats got blocked. Seats are blocked on the airplane as well. The entire trip, I didnt have to be close distance with anyone. Makes me feel very safe    United: no seats block in the waiting are. No seats blocked on the airplane at all, the flight is completely full. Except a company employee sat by himself with one empty seat next to him (obviously he got that favor by being an employee). Ironically, when they announced boarding, they talked about social distancing, while they made it impossible to social distancing by cramming all the passengers on plane.    It is such a big difference between two airline under the same circumstances, and I can see United putting profit over customer"
Aug 2020,30,Disappointed,"This was my first time flying United since covid started, and wasn't my best experience. The flight attendant in the first class cabin had a pretty nasty attitude. She kept wanted me to keep my face mask on even when I was eating and drinking. She said I have to keep it on between each bites. Just a little silly, and way overdoing her job. There was no meal served on the 5h30 flight, and no alcoholic beverages served in economy, but no problem in first class? The entertainment system was very spotty, and no seat back entertainment either. Overall, this was a very disappointing flight, and was expecting more of United considering the fact that nobody wants to fly anymore."
Aug 2020,10,False Claims of adhering to COVID-19 safety measures,"Two weeks after purchasing flight, an email was sent by United updating my travel itinerary changing my transit time from 7hrs to 14hrs, including adding 5hrs of layover time at an additional 2 airports. This not only doubles the exposure time and risk but also disproves their claim that safety is at the forefront of their business ethics. Would avoid this airline at all costs.    Also, you will need to pay $70 for a carry on and an additional $10-35 on selecting your seat. Avoid."
Aug 2020,50,Superb customer support,"United Airlines has superb customer support staff. There was a mistake with my booking for an international flight, and the customer support staff and their supervisors were very professional and went out of there way to help me. Excellent rating based on my excellent experience with their customer support. Getting the help took some time, but a reasonable amount."
Aug 2020,10,Canceling Flights During Covid 2 days before trip,"Selected United Airlines before the Covid pandemic kicked off (in February) for a flight in August based on price and past experience. Once Covid got severe in the USA, we started monitoring the flights on a daily basis to ensure our flight did not get too crowded (given that United refuses to block out the middle seat like other, superior airlines like Delta and Southwest). All looked well with the flight at only 1/3 capacity. Only TWO days before the departure date, they canceled adjacent flights, leaving our flight at 80% capacity and the middle seat between myself and my traveling companion occupied by a stranger.    I believe they waited until the last minute to cancel on purpose, knowing that the prices for better airlines would increase significantly by that time. If we had known they would cancel two weeks ago, we could have canceled our flights and moved over to Southwest. Now, that is financially infeasible. I would consider this at best a dirty business practice, and at worst unethical entrapment into an unsafe travel situation.    I will not flight United again unless there are no rational alternatives."
Aug 2020,50,Wow! Such an amazing experience!!,"United has always been a good airline to me and I have flown it many times, both internationally and domestically.  The most recent flight though was an exceptional experience! The entire crew, especially the flight attendants, were outstanding! They were so sweet and you can tell their outstanding service was a genuine act.    Additionally, they did a great job at responding to covid by taking all the necessary precautions: social distancing, masks, middle seat empty.    I am so proud of airlines stepping up and pulling through all of this, they are also essential heroes that we shouldn’t forget about!"
Aug 2020,10,Worse than spirit,"No social distancing, the plane was full and we were all touching each other. Charges you for everything even when requesting to sit with wife, carry on bag went through first time then they asked that we check in the bag because it’s to big. We also requested if they could sit me and my wife together because we had separate sit and still wanted to charge us when other airline have no problem doing it. Don’t pick this airline unless you want to 1. Get the virus, 2. Get charged for everything, 3. Have your planes delayed. 4. Worst service"
Aug 2020,10,Delayed flight,The flight was delayed in philly and they wouldn't let us land in Chicago so I missed my connecting flight and had to stay the night in Chicago on my dime! This airline couldn't care less about your well being or good customer service as long as they are making a quick buck. Any other airline would have provided a hotel at no cost whatsoever.
Aug 2020,10,Never again,"i was coming from Queretaro-houston transbordin houston-atlanta on gate b80  No one advised us that they changed the gate the flight leave us, the customer service was re-bocking the flight next day al 10 am and telling me to pass the night at the airport in Houston, at the end they send us to Birmingham Alabama, now I have to send someone to pick me up in Alabama, go to Atlanta to get my baggage. Never again with this company United!!!"
Jul 2020,10,United Doesn't Care if you DIE if they can make an extra buck,"Never ever fly United, especially during Corona. This was the worst flight experience of my entire life. A Corona hotspot flight from Miami to Houston that was at full capacity. It was almost as if United was recruiting bodies for the virus to infect. Technically, the customers aboard the flight were supposed to wear masks, but once the flight started several people removed their masks for the duration of the flight. In fact, one couple even removed their masks so they could giddily make out for the entire flight and yelp like hyenas.Nothing was said to these customers. United's response to all this corona madness- simply blow some creepy disco fog machine at the beginning of the flight for 5 minutes and act like everything was all good. Like seriously, if we could just build a massive ventilation system then obviously corona would die. United deserves to fail, and it is a shame that they received our taxed dollars instead of American families who are struggling to eat."
Jul 2020,10,Horrible customer service during COVID 19,"First flight was cancelled by United due to Covid. They gave us a voucher. We rebooked a new flight for the same day. Then we got an email stating that portions/legs of our new flight were canceled/unconfirmed. Asked for a refund since they cancelled BOTH flights for this event and we no longer trusted that booking a new flight wouldn't be cancelled as well--we decided to just drive.    Over an hour on the phone with customer service. Two reps hung up on me as soon as I explained the problem. Nobody would refund us to our credit card because the ""second flight was paid for with the travel voucher"" so they could ""only refund us to a voucher""--when the ONLY reason we used a voucher was because they cancelled our first flight (for which we were entitled to a refund). Horrible customer service and now they are keeping our money for a flight they cancelled twice. We have no intention of flying with them again."
Jul 2020,10,No care for clients!!!!,"Other airlines care for the individuals who use them, not this airlines, not at all. We were very surprised after flying Delta to Seattle, that our return flight was with United. Delta showed several ways of taking care of their clients by only filling every other seat, cleaning before we got on, Handing out cleaners. United did none of these things. We asked about it and was told we could get off if we didn't like it but that is just how it is. So we stayed because,Of course, we needed to get somewhere, but everyone should know how United does not care for its clients. Also, they called us to board, everyone got up, then they waited 15 minutes while we were all gathered together. No social distancing. I was very, very disappointed in this airlines. We do have a choice now when we fly and now we know better than to fly United."
Jul 2020,10,NEVER AGAIN!,"United Airlines is thee worst to work with--when booking a flight, doing anything on their website and talking to them over the phone. I had two vouchers ($108 and $20) I am trying to book 2 flights as we speak...They took my voucher, subtracted it from the total and charged my card the rest of the amount but then never received a confirmation email---charge went through and now they wont let me have my tickets NOR my vouchers back. HOW IS THIS REAL!!!! I have been on the phone for 40 minutes!!! A total of $128 of vouchers!!! They.are.terrible."
Jul 2020,10,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"All I can say, is there customer service is absolutely AWFUL! I had booked a flight to California for a bachelorette and had to change it multiple times due to covid- 19. I canceled 3 months before my flight with the hopes of a refund back to my credit card considering the state of what the world is right now and the loss of money I had incurred. I don't fly United very often and I won't be flying for a while and now I DEFINITELY will not be using them ever again! I lost $300 dollars right down the drain and there customer service team could have no care in the world. Disappointing and I highly recommend to never fly united. If the supervisor I spoke with, was kind enough to give my money back I would have a different outlook on this airline."
Jul 2020,50,Sr,"Angel Prado, and his coworkers at the México City Airport, demonstrated enormous patience with me. Because I forgot that I could not carry two bottles of alcohol on board with me,in my backpack, I was stopped by security. Angel and Sandra helped me to recover my suitcase to repack my bottles of alcohol. It seemed so complicated, but they made my experience pleasent"
Jul 2020,10,Horrible service,"I received a notice saying my flight was cancelled I booked 3 months ago. I called United to request a refund and explained my situation of changing bank accounts. The representative was not understanding of the situation and told me they will not update my card information. Southwest airlines and American airlines updated my card information and processed the refund no problem. United is the only company that made me run around to get a refund. I will NEVER book a flight with them again with all the inconvenience they put me through. Do not book through United. If you need a refund, they will try and make it as hard as possible for you!"
Jul 2020,20,sucks,southwest is better. flight attendants yell at me. it’s like i’m walking into a cult every time i get on the plane. suggestion: make it purple like virgin airlines and maybe i will reconsider. ❤️ or add a tv or too. or free cookies. or stroop waffles. up to you. ❤️
Jul 2020,10,Mr,Worst airline ever!!!Guaranteed to NOT get you to your destination on time!!!2 nd weekend in a row that my 2 hour wait became an 8 hour layover!Why?A flight attendant didn't show...!Now my ride from my destination is gone as well!United to screw your travel plans up guaranteed!
Jul 2020,10,Horrendous experience fling with Emotional Support Animal,"I called their help center over a week before my flight and was told that since my dog is an Emotional Support Animal, all I need to do is bring my Rabies and Health Certificates with me to the gate. Upon arrival at the airport, they said that I needed to submit my ESA's paperwork online two weeks before travel! I ended up having to pay for a ticket for my ESA and being told several times by the woman behind the counter that I would be able to hold my dog and also THAT I WOULD BE REIMBURSED if after my flight, I submit my pets ESA paperwork.    The crew would then not allow my ESA to sit with me. They made him go under the seat in front of me the entire time! He cried for the whole flight and was so nervous he pooped himself. It was a horrible experience for both of us. NEVER FLY UNITED WITH ANIMALS!    They refused my claim for reimbursement and honestly, we fly often, and I've NEVER had an experience this awful."
Jul 2020,10,They are the worst airlines I've ever have done business with.,"Do yourself a favor people should you be looking at airlines avoid this one at all costs. They have hidden fees, They charge the smallest things but the worst part of it all is during a pandemic that has no sure date of ending there policy is to give you a credit to purchase another flight from them instead of refunding your money. The basic inhumanity this corporation has is disgusting, all they see are numbers and profits and not people. They don't care about the customers i even have a interaction with there customer service representative stating that yes the corporation only cares about money and not the customer. They are beyond disgusting and i genuinely hope this pandemic does to them what they do to there customer."
Jul 2020,40,Dec - UA5656 Los Angeles to Phoenix EMB-175 (#N146SY) FC Seats 2C & D,"Dec - UA5656 Los Angeles to Phoenix EMB-175 (#N146SY) FC Seats 2C & D    After our flight to LAX from LHR, on Monday, December 30, we flew United Airlines UA5656 home to Phoenix (PHX), on an EMB-175 (N146SY), in First Class, in seats 2C & D. The flight was operated by Skywest Airlines, dba United Express. This was the third time, in four months, that we had taken this exact flight, after returning from London.    As we were a bit late arriving from LHR, we headed directly to T8, and our departure gate, 86A. Along the way, the great United App informed us of a gate change - to Gate 81. Our plane had just come in from SBP (San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport) to LAX.    We walked over to Gate 81 (our departure gate), and boarded before Group 1, due to our status. We took our seats on the starboard side of the plane, and near the front of First Class. The EMB-175 is configured 1-2 in First Class, with 4 rows of seats, then E and E+ are 2-2. One limitation in FC is that the bins above the A seats, are tiny, but my small briefcase fits - though not much more than a medium-sized purse would. That means that all FC passengers, will mostly need the larger bins, above the C & D seats. Also, a bit of the bin real estate is used for safety equipment, at the front of the FC cabin. As those starboard bins are pretty generous, my wife’s wheeled briefcase fit easily. The EMB-175 has good underseat storage in FC, unlike several other Regional Jets in the UA fleet. Another aspect, which I like about this plane is that it has a closet, near the galley, unlike the CRJ-200/700's and the EMB-145's. As we always fly with our jackets, the closet is greatly appreciated.    We declined the pre-departure beverage, and slept through the passed snack basket, and especially as we had been well-fed on our LHR-LAX flight.    The EMB-175 has PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), which is streamed for free, to one’s device, but on the short 1:24 hr flight (actual flight time was 1:15), neither of us used it. It also had WiFi, for a fee, but it went unused, as well.    We took off to heavy haze and low clouds at LAX, in the dark. We were into those clouds all of the way into PHX, and barely got to see the lights of the city. Especially in the Winter, I prefer to fly from London through SFO, and get home to PHX at an earlier hour. This was the second time (November), where we basically took off from LAX, and arrived at PHX in the dark, though not sure if we’d have been able to see anything, given the heavy clouds. I had sort of hoped that we would do a fly-over of Phoenix, and land on Runway 25R, or 26, as we sometimes do, to see the Holiday lights around the city, and also the Zoo Lights, visible on final approach from the east - but not sure if I could have stayed awake for that?    We landed at PHX, on-time, and parked at Gate 7, and our luggage came out rather quickly onto Carousel 4, and we were headed home - the last flight of the year! We had five days at home, before we would start flying again in 2020, with 26 flights already booked on United.    The short flight was good, smooth and quiet, with a nice Cabin Crew (only interacted with them on boarding), and on a plane, which we have come to enjoy, the EMB-175. We strongly prefer it to the other Regional Jets in United Express fleet."
Jul 2020,40,Dec - UA5435 Phoenix to Los Angeles ERJ-175 (#N143SY) FC Seats 3A & 4A,"Dec - UA5435 Phoenix to Los Angeles ERJ-175 (#N143SY) FC Seats 3A & 4A    On Friday, December 27, we flew United Airlines UA5435, from Phoenix (PHX) to Los Angeles (LAX), as the first leg of a business trip to London (LHR), in First Class, Seats 3A & 4A, on an EMB-175 (#N143SY), operated by SkyWest Airlines, dba United Express. This was a plane change from an EMB-175 (#118SY). As this trip was added at the last minute, 3 & 4A were the only First Class seats available. In all of our flights on United Express EMB-145's, I think that this was the first time we had flown in the port side seats, in the 1-2 FC configuration on those planes.    We had just taken this same flight in Sept and Nov, so were familiar with it, and the normal timing. We also connected at LAX for our next leg to LHR. We started the morning at the little United Club at PHX, with a glass of Champagne, and then walked down to Gate 7 in T2. This gate is immediately across from the United Club.    We boarded on-time, and had taken our seats, before Group 1 was called. On the UA EMB-175's, there are 4 rows of seats, in a 1-2 configuration, in First Class. These are designated A and then C & D, with no B seats. The overhead bins above the A seats is very small, but long ago, I realized that my small briefcase fit perfectly there - though not much else, besides a medium-sized purse will. My wife’s small wheeled-briefcase does fit nicely in the bins, above the C-D seats (starboard side of the plane), and there is a convenient closet by the galley in FC, where our jackets were hung.    We like the EMB-175, and fortunately fly it often, but too often have a CRJ-200, which is not one of our favorite planes - along with the EMB-145.    These seats are very comfortable, with good pitch, and good width, plus comfortable lower cushions, at 37"" pitch and 20"" width.. The width is slightly reduced, as the tray tables are in the fixed armrests.    As these seats are stand-alone, there is no podium, and the little drink tray pulls out of the left side armrest. I noticed that the tray is not level, so a bit of care needs to be taken, with the pre-departure drink, or any drink in-flight. We only did a glass of the Camelot, CA Chardonnay, which is not our favorite, but UAX has had it as their white wine for years now.    Our plane was clean, and we had no issues with the functionality of any aspect of the aircraft..    Our Flight Attendant was very good, and very friendly, but did not get to do full cabin service, due to turbulence. The weather was lousy at PHX, and did not get any better, into LAX. We were hoping that it would clear up a bit, prior to our LAX-LHR flight..    This plane did have PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), providing streaming content to one’s personal device, and this service is free. Because of the short duration, neither of us used it. It also had WiFi (for a fee), but as neither of us used it, I cannot comment on how well it might have performed.    Oddly, wee arrived at LAX T7 Gate 70A, just a few minutes late, and as many passengers had tight international connections at LAX, we stayed in our seats, until they had all deplaned. Our connection was much longer. Usually, the UAX flights arrive at LAX T8. and normally Gate 86, so this was a surprise - I thought that the App was mistaken, but it was not. This meant that we had but a very short walk to the new United Polaris Lounge in T7, and essentially next to our LHR departure gate, 76A.    In all, a very good, but bumpy, very short flight."
Jul 2020,50,Dec - UA935 London to Los Angeles 787-10 (#1003) Polaris Seats 5D & F,"Dec - UA935 London to Los Angeles 787-10 (#1003) Polaris Seats 5D & F    On Monday, December 30, we flew United UA935 from London (LHR) to Los Angeles (LAX) on a 787-10 (#1003) in Polaris First Class, seats 5D and F. This 787-10 was a change from the 787-9, which had been scheduled to fly the route. Our seats were changed, which alarmed us, until we realized that the plane were on, was a 787-10, and a new one, with the FULL Polaris First Class cabin! Lately, we have flown this route (and this exact flight), and only had what is called Polaris Business, which I call “Polaris-Light.” This was the real deal, and something that we had not experienced, since a few flights SFO-LHR on refurbished 777's - several trips ago.    We started our morning at the United Global Services Lounge (third time in 4 months), and made our way down to Gate B-47, directly across fro the Lounge. I am not sure if the plane change was perhaps due to an issue with the previously assigned one, but we were delayed in boarding, by about an hour. The Global Services rep had us checked in, and to our seats immediately, and we had all squared away. The weather was lousy at LHR, so it was not bad, that we were in interior seats. Our carry-on luggage fit easily in the bin above my seat, as did our blankets and pillows.    We were familiar with the full Polaris First Class pods, though had only flown in those on the 777's, so there was a little bit of a shakedown. Also, as most of our recent flights had been in Polaris-light, we needed a moment to reorient ourselves.    Full Polaris:    The Seats/Pods:  These seats fully recline into a 100% lay-flat bed, just like the two pods in the classes that Polaris “combined/replaced.” The “bed” is fairly comfortable, and a bit wider, than in Polaris-light, but slightly more narrow, than the old Global First Class pods.    With the 1-2-1 configuration, there is full aisle access from all seats. The armrests are inside the pod shell, and can be lowered or raised, to several positions, and when lowered, more width is provided. Also, as the shell of the pod is much larger, one does not have to worry about others bumping them, when walking by in the aisles.    These pods are less claustrophobic, than the Polaris-light pods, and also have good footwell space.    Lighting changes – overhead light is good, and in 5D & F, fairly well-placed above the fully retractable tray table. Also, there is a side table top, with task lighting, and then a lighted cabinet, with the amenity kit, United Bose NC headphones, and a nice little mirror.    The tray table – pull out/fold out from below the AVOD monitor. Not quite a jigsaw puzzle, but one does need to work with it a bit, to get the placement perfect..    Coat hanging clip in pod – convenient for landing. During takeoff and flight, the flight attendants store coats in closet.  Seat/bed comfort – a bit better than the old Global Business Class units, and I recommend asking for the “mattress pad,” for a bit more cushion.    Walls/partitions – Between the center seats, there is a retractable privacy wall, which has several positions, and is quite wide. These seemed to be the same width, for all of those center seats, where in Polaris-light, they alternate from small, to large, every other row..    Bedding – Polaris full Saks 5th Ave soft-product – great, and an extra contour-pillow, and mattress cover, available upon request. This soft product has been the same for all of our Polaris flights - full Polaris, and Polaris-light.    Storage – Storage bins are more plentiful in Full Polaris, but still short of the old Global First Class pods, which seemed to have bins/pockets/lockers everywhere - still, and improvement over the Polaris-light pods, and the little lighted closet is very nice.    General seat comfort – Good, and more adjustments, than the Polaris-light pods/seats..    A/VOD – Full Polaris has large, high-def, flat-screen monitors, but maybe not as large, as with Polaris-light, but with a higher resolution. These are touch-screen monitors, but one needs to be seated in the takeoff/landing position to reach the screen, and I have long arms.    “Charging ports – Nice array of AC, USB and other connections, conveniently located in pod wall, over a small shelf. AC is USA/Universal 120V standard. Earphone plug is 1-2 prong, and is located, so that cable does dangle over one’s shoulder. My 1-prong Bose QC15 worked fine, and the 2-prong UA Bose headset (power from the second prong) was good. We did not use the United Bose earphones on this flight, but on a previous flight, I tested mine, and they worked fine, though I like my Bose QC15's better. My wife used her Bose NC Earbuds, and all worked fine for her.    Amenity kit – sort of a scaled back version of the older Business FC kits. Nothing special, and a far cry from the kits once offered in Global FC. Still, OK kits. They also featured a full array of the new Sunday Riley products, replacing the Cow Shed line, no comb, which had been included for years, but they did have a little pen, unlike those on our London flights, just two months before. These kits were Star Wars themed, and the exact same as we got on the five Polaris-light flights.    Seatbelts - like with the old Global First Class seats, these have a shoulder strap, to be used during takeoff and landing, and I found it comfortable.    Once airborne, we had warmed, scented towels, followed by the normal United Warm Mixed Nuts. We went with the Weingut Bründlmayer Grüner Veltliner L & T Langenlois-Östereich ‘17, a nice wine, that we have now had on 5 recent, previous flights..    The wine line up was identical as on those previous flights::  Gunderloch Red Stone Riesling ‘16  Jean-Marc Brocard Chablis ‘17 - my favorite, along with the Grüner Veltliner  Then, for the reds, we had:  Bouchard Père & Fils Côte De Beaune Villages ‘16  Gundlach Bundschu Sonoma County Mountain Cuvée Red Wine ‘16  Hope Estate The Ripper Shiraz Western Australia ‘14 - my favorite    One exception was that on our LAX-LHR outbound flight, the only pre-departure wine available, was the Camelot CA Chardonnay, which is the white wine of United Express - in a plastic bottle. No so on this flight, as the full wine list was available, as the pre-departure beverage.    Our in-flight meal began about 90 mins into the flight, and consisted of:  Starter - Chilled Appetizer of Turbot w/ asparagus, potatoes and bell peppers - good Turbot!  Salad - Mixed Greens w/ peppers and then a side plate of Burrata and sliced tomatoes, served with dressing, and assorted breads - United’s chef must know that I am not a fan of raw bell peppers, as he/she keeps putting them on everything.  Main Course:  Mediterranean-style Chicken w/ couscous, almonds, raisins, apricots and butternut squash tajine - this was the same dish that we had on this flight, back in September, and we both got it, which is something that we normally do not do.    The other Main Course options were:  Carrot Manicotti w/ goat cheese sauce, pumpkin and fennel, which had been a let down, on a previous flight.  Braised Beef Short Ribs w/ porcini mushroom sauce, au gratin potatoes, roasted carrots, celery and parsnip - we have had about 50-50 results with United’s Beef Short Ribs, with some quite good, and some inedible.  Roasted Halibut w/ lobster sauce, whole-grain mustard mashed potatoes, carrots, green beans, leeks and lemon - this was what I had also ordered previously, and found it to be good    For Dessert, I went with the Churchill Late Bottle Vintage Port ‘15, declining the Cheese Course. My wife chose a little cake, and a bowl of the United “Signature Sundae,” from the pastry cart, plus the LBV Port.    We also declined the pre-arrival meal of:  Macaroni & Cheese “Pie,” and the Hamburger Wellington.    With our late departure, we arrived at LAX about 1:23 hrs late, but still had time for Immigration and Customs, to make our departing flight from T8, Gate 86B, for home to Phoenix.    We usually take an earlier flight out of LHR, so it a bit odd to us, arriving at dark, and then arriving back home to PHX so late, after a very long (10:50 hr) flight. After CBP processing, we made our way directly to T8, as we were ready to just be home.    The entire flight was very good, although late, and our Cabin Crew was great, as usual. As we fly this route often, we have had quite a few familiar crew members, but on this flight (maybe because of the Holidays?), all were new to us.    It was nice to have the last flight of 2019 behind us, but are already booked for the PHX-LAX-LHR-SFO (our preferred airport for the USA to Heathrow route)-PHX for April - along with 26 other UA flights, for 2020."
Jul 2020,40,Dec - UA923 Los Angeles to London 787-9 (#3959) Polaris Seats 8K & L,"Dec - UA923 Los Angeles to London 787-9 (#3959) Polaris Seats 8K & L    On Friday, December 27, we flew United Airlines UA923 from Los Angles (LAX), to London Heathrow (LHR). This was on a 787-9 (#3959), in Polaris Business Seats 8K & L. This was the third time that we had taken this LAX-LHR flight this year - once in Sept, and then in Nov. This was an earlier 787-9, and had not been retro-fitted with the full Polaris layout. Going back a bit, United basically did away with Business and First Class, and combined those into Polaris, but there are still two different Polaris configurations. This one, the older version, was called “Polaris Business,” but I call it “Polaris Light.” It has the full Polaris soft product, but is still basically a business class seat/pod, which is a holdover from the old Global Business Class. The configuration in Polaris Business on this 787-9 was 2-2-2, and all forward facing. We had the starboard 2 seats, side-by-side, at the rear bulkhead. The center seats are slightly offset from the outboard rows, by about ½ a pod. I will go into more detail on the configuration, and amenities, later on. Having just done this flight twice before, we knew that we would be arriving in London, before our hotel room was ready. Normally, we fly SFO-LHR, which arrives about 2 hrs later, but no seats were available on that flight.    We had arrived at LAX from our home airport PHX (Phoenix), on a United Express flight, and as we had a very leisurely connection, we spent our time in the newly opened United Polaris Club in T7, at LAX - where the old International First Club was located - but now completely redone. Oddly, our UAX flight had arrived at Gate 70A (usually to T8, and Gate 86), so we were already in T7, and near our departure gate.    We walked down to our departure gate, 76A (usually Gate 74, and were in the first group to board - just before the 1K’s, and then Group 1. We were in our pods, and got things squared away. Though in the older Polaris configuration, the overhead bins are still spacious, and we had briefcases, and then all of our bedding easily stored above our seats. Looking around the cabin, just before bin doors were closed, I would guess that only about 40% of the total overhead space was used in this forward cabin.    This flight was about 98% full, looking at the monitor, but I am not certain if it filled completely, by the time to board?    One thing that I noticed (and we flew this same cabin configuration on similar planes twice in the previous two months), was that the seat number was displayed on each AVOD monitor screen - I had never seen that before. Nice feature.    Normally, United offers a nice Champagne, as a pre-departure beverage. Strangely, there was only the Camelot CA Chardonnay available, at this time. This is the white wine of United Express, and not very good. I was taking this to be an omen, of sorts, and especially as we had done two London flights, where the ground staff forgot to load the wines. Our jackets were stored in the forward closet, and we were ready for our 10:30 hr flight to LHR. We had boarded on time, and were taking off on time - always a good sign, though the weather had not improved, since we arrived at LAX from PHX.    Now for Polaris Class on this particular 787:  Seats/Pods:  The seats fully recline into a 100% lay-flat bed, just like the two pods in the classes that Polaris “combined/replaced.” The “bed” was comfortable, though its width was closer (or seemed to me) to that from the old Business FC units, and not the more spacious old Global FC pods, or as spacious as the FULL Polaris pods, which are nicer, but still short of the Global FC pods. The recline controls are on the podium, and worked well. Here are my observations on Polaris-Light vs Full Polaris, with some Global First Class comments, thrown in:  Full aisle access – Only from the middle seats, and not those on the port, or starboard side - one much climb over their seat mate. I let my wife have the aisle, for easier access, and I still had hopes of getting a few photos out of the window.    Slightly claustrophobic – More like the old Business FC, and remember that there are subtle changes, in alternating rows. Arm rests do drop down, but that extra width exposes one to passengers and crew passing by in the aisle, just a bit.    Lighting changes – overhead light is good, but in seat 8K & L, a bit misplaced, and not as useful for filling in paperwork. I had encountered the same lighting alignment issue, in seat 1E, and 3E on our previous London flights. The light should have a broader beam, as it is concentrated at the back of the tray table, when extended.    Tray table – Combo of slide out (on an arced track) and fold-out. OK, but a bit cumbersome.  Coat hanging clip in pod – convenient for landing. During takeoff and flight, the flight attendants store coats in a forward closet.    Seat/bed comfort – about the same, as with the old Global Business Class units, and I recommend asking for the “mattress pad,” for a bit more cushion.    Armrests – one side (aisle side 8K and fuselage side on 8L) did retract, for more width, but not as much, as the old Global FC pods did. As I do retract the arm rest, it was nice being on the fuselage side, as if on the aisle side, folk in the aisle tend to bump you.    Partitions between seats – higher, for more privacy – as observed in my previous reviews of United Polaris, the partitions between the middle pods on the 787 differ per alternating rows, and then between pods at the bulkheads. With Seats 8K & L, we had a small partition. It looked like all of the starboard seats had the same, and that they did not alternate in size, like the middle seats did.    The Bedding – Polaris full Saks 5th Ave soft-product – great, and an extra contour-pillow, and mattress cover, available upon request.    Storage – Storage bins have decreased in number and definitely size, from Global FC. There are fewer places to store anything, than even in the old Business FC, and far fewer (number and size), than in Global FC. One gets one extra shelf, above the footwell, but that is completely inaccessible, when the seat/bed is reclined. There was an odd little shelf, immediately below the monitor, which was quite deep, but not very tall. Maybe for a laptop, as there was a USB input port on the monitor?  General seat comfort – OK, but many of the intermediate positions are not really comfortable. In these new pods, everything sort of works together, and it is difficult, to impossible, to adjust just one aspect, say the seatback only – cannot be done. I liked the old style seat controls, where one could make adjustments to just one aspect of the seat, and not have to accept that any change would be global for the seat.    A/VOD – Full Polaris has large, high-def, flat-screen monitors, which are an improvement over the screens from Business FC, and even Global FC. The monitors in Polaris-light are medium-rez, so an improvement, but in Full Polaris, they are much better. Controls are tethered, like before, but seemed a bit “fiddley.” Programming was extensive, but the categorization a bit “odd” in places. Though I have been using similar A/VOD systems on UA flights, I had to experiment a bit more, and it seemed that choices were harder to make, but the monitors are also “touch-screen.” The A/VOD monitor is a bit far forward, to allow for touch-screen, unless the seat is fully upright, and even then, one probably has to take off their seatbelt. Recently, United added the Star Wars movies, and even have a tie-in with the latest/last one. The napkins feature Star Wars, as does the Safety Video. While not the best, it is so much better, than the recent Spider-Man Safety Video - that was awful.    Charging ports – Nice array of AC, USB and other connections, conveniently located in pod wall, over a small shelf. AC was USA/Universal 120V standard. Earphone plug is 1-2 prong, and is located, so that cable does dangle over one’s shoulder. My 1-prong Bose QC15 worked fine, and the 2-prong UA Bose headset (power from the second prong) was good. There is no small closet-like compartment in Polaris-light, so the UA supplied Bose earphones reside in a little leather pocket in the storage area, behind the seat. On this flight I did not try the UA Bose headphones, but did on my flight a couple of months before, and found them OK, but not up to my Bose QC15's.    Amenity kit – sort of a scaled back version of the older Business FC kits. Nothing special, and a far cry from the kits once offered in Global FC. Still, OK kits. They also featured a full array of the new Sunday Riley products, replacing the Cow Shed line, but no comb, which had been included for years. Unlike the most recent amenity kits, these did have a little pen. These had a “Star Wars” theme to them. Also, the Safety Video was now Star Wars themed. I was able to finish up all of the Star Wars films, which I had started doing in September.    The overhead bins were quite spacious, and our two briefcases, a small backpack, my wife’s purse and my hat, all fit easily. There was even room to store the bed linens, until needed. Our jackets were hung in the forward closet.    Though we were in the last row of Polaris, close to the galley, and a set of toilets, we had no noise, and the crew closed the curtains against light, for much of the flight. One thing that I did notice was that the toilets, at the rear of Polaris, are larger than those forward, and likely due to the taper of the fuselage, toward the front. I had never noticed that before, but it makes perfect sense.    Once airborne, we had warmed, scented towels, followed by the normal United Warm Mixed Nuts. We moved to the still white wine, which was the Jean-Marc Brocard Chablis ‘17 - Whew! They had loaded the wines. Later, we tried the Gunderloch Red Stone Riesling ‘17, and also the Terras Gauda O Rosal Rias Baixas Blanca ‘16.    For dinner, we had a very similar menu, as we had on that Sept, 02 flight, but there were a few differences too.    We started dinner with:  Chilled Appetizer of Smoked Duck w/ farro salad with dried cranberries, brined carrots and whole-grained mustard. On the two previous LAX-LHR flights, we had the same Thai-style Shrimp, which were quite good, but I think that the Duck was better. I went to the Gravières du Roy ‘12, Samur-Champigny ‘16 red, and it worked well.  Salad of mixed greens w/ fennel and bell pepper, served with pomegranate açaí vinaigrette, and assorted breads - fair salad, as I am not a fan of raw bell peppers..  My Main Course was: Seared Lemon Grass Salmon w/ coconut red curry sauce, Thai coconut risotto, stir-fried bell pepper (the chef was out to get me), carrot and onion. This was another tasty fish dish out of LAX - so far, all have been quite good - a Hake and a Turbot.  My wife had the Ginseng Chicken Bowl w/ ginseng lemon grass chicken broth, grilled chicken, chicken and lemongrass pot-stickers, carrots and celery - this was a good dish, and totally new to the LAX-LHR menu.    The other two Main Course options were:  Seared Beef Short-rib w/ hoisin barbecue sauce, jasmine rice, Broccolini and carrots - we have had mixed results with the United Beef Short-ribs, and especially out of LAX. Some have been excellent, but a few have been disasters. She had just had a good one, in Nov, but wanted to try something else.  Jumbo Burrata Ravioli w/ Pomodoro sauce, basil pesto, roasted tomatoes and Parmesan cheese - this was a tempting dish for me, but I decided to go with the Salmon, which was very good..    During the flight, and starting with my meal I explored the other wine options, with the Château Greysac Bordeaux blend, Gravières du Roy ‘12, Samur-Champigny ‘16 and Benzinger Sonoma County Merlot ‘14. All were good, and the Merlot went well with the Beef Short Rib.    I opted for the International Cheese Assortment, and a glass of the Churchill LBV Port ‘14, while my wife went for an a small bit of cake, and then the United “Signature Sundae.”    There was a pre-arrival meal of:  Herbed Cream Cheese Omelet w/ chicken sausage, and potatoes w/ fruit  Or Seasonal Fruit w/ cereal and milk  We declined on both, and only had coffee, especially as we had lunch planned already in London, plus a rather early dinner.    We left LAX with lousy weather, hit a few bumps on the way out, then had a relatively smooth flight, until our initial approach to LHR, where we picked up some more bumps. We made a fairly direct approach to LHR, with low clouds, and haze, so nothing to photograph..    The entire Cabin Crew was excellent, and we wanted for nothing. They were efficient, and quite cheerful.    We landed a few minutes early, and we were off for the long walk to Immigration and Customs in T2. With the newish Passport scanners, we were through Immigration in moments - there was no line, and though 2 of those kiosks were out of service, we had two units ready for us. The luggage was fairly quick to come out, and with “Nothing to Declare,” we just walked straight through Customs, heading to the taxi queue, down one level. Again, the longest wait of this entire process, other than the long walk, was for the elevator/lift, to get to the lower level. There was no queue for a cab, so we were quickly off to our hotel in Mayfair.    A very nice flight, with zero complaints, other than having the Camelot for the pre-departure wine!."
Jul 2020,20,Charged me 3 times for one ticket!,"I booked online, website had an error. It charged me twice for one ticket and gave me no confirmation info. I called their 800 number only to be told they didn’t take out the money and I had to “repurchase” the ticket. Even though I was looking at try account and it showed they had already charged me twice! They ended up charging my 3 times that day! That’s almost $900 taken out of my account in one day!! Spoke to several representatives who said money would be put back within 24-48 HOURS. It has been 7 days and the money finally has been put back into my account this morning! Absolutely ridiculous!  The only positive thing about this whole experience is the ONE lady I spoke to was so patient and helped me get my ticket booked over the phone.  Will never be using them again."
Jul 2020,10,United Airlines,"I was on a flight w/ United Airlines on the 6th of July. There were well over 100 people on the flight(while still forcing us to use masks) jammed packed us in like sardines. However when I spoke with alaska, and United all over the phone they all agreed there would be social distancing even on the jets. However alaska and delta were the only airlines actually following procedure. Not to mention, after they packed us in there like sardines. We sat on the plane for 2 hours. Then due to a baggage issue and a engine issues . Everybody was told to deplane all at once. No organization whatsoever. So after waiting a day and a half(now without my luggage) I boarded another United plane with the same seating issue. Less seats, just as jammed pack. Half way through my flight I trash from the last flight all under and in front of my seat. That was the breaking point. During a pandemic. Over 100 people jammed packed, in an enclosed area for over 4 hours, and obviously no legit sanitation from the last 100 people that were on it. Alaska however was absolutely amazing. They did everything the best, and as organized as they could with nothing but grace. I didnt get to experience Delta but also heard from other passengers the experience was nice. United needs a reality check. So my 1x rating would be for them. The picture is me in the middle seat only 3 quarters of the way into the plane. Still multiple people behind us."
Jul 2020,40,Great First class flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Dulles,"Great flight from Ft. Lauderdale. Airline was very cautious with social distancing and keeping passengers from crowding around. Very nice flight, arrived early. Particularly liked both boarding and deplaning. Went very, very smoothly. Excellent boxed lunch."
Jul 2020,10,Dishonest Company that frauded my wife and I out of a legal refund,My wife and I purchased tickets to visit family prior to the outbreak of the Corona Virus. The flights were cancelled by United Airlines. We requested a refund and United Airlines sent us and email confirming that they would make a refund in full to our original credit card. I checked back months later and was told that they had changed there mind and that we would Not get the refund despite the fact that there are legally required to do so.  This is a DISHONEST company and should NOT be trusted.
Jul 2020,50,Amazing staff at the Minot Airport,"United Airlines staff at the Minot, ND Airport is incredibly kind, helpful, organized, and have a good sense of humor. They make you feel welcome. TSA there is also amazing. The Bismarck United staff should take note about how the Minot staff is. I've had nothing but problems flying out of Bismarck. One flight, the TSA had my bag torn apart while searching it, ripped open my Christmas presents, pulled the padding out of my swimsuit, and made me sit for 35 minutes while they tested my work boots because I work in the oilfield and they had oil on them that glowed during my scan. They told me that I don't ""Look like the type of girl who works in the oilfield."" They also refused to let me repack my bag correctly because ""they already took possession of it."" They opened my preserved jelly that I got for my mom, took a knife to my protein powder to cut it open to test it instead of opening the zipper, and wouldn't give me a ziplock to put the powder in or tape to seal the tear they made. Another time I arrived to Bismarck 55 min early, parked, went in and the United Rep.was on the phone with her back to me. I politely waited until she finished her phone call. United policy states ou need to check a bag 45 min before donestic departure to check a bag. She turns around finally, I gave her my pass, prepaid bag confirmation, and ID and she said ""Sorry, you missed the flight."" I said ""What are you talking about, it's 45 min to departure to check a bag, and you were on the phone when I was trying to check in."" She said, ""Sorry you missed the cutoff by 4 minutes, it's actually 45 minutes to boarding to check in a bag, you can put your bag in the car and fly without it."" I told her ""That's not possible, I have Christmas presents for my mom that I need to take. Your terms say 45 minutes to departure."" She said ""Sorry, but you're wrong, rules are rules."" They hadn't even started boarding yet, and they were not even loading bags on the plane yet as I could see the cart being loaded next to the airport. She ended up rebooking me for a flight 5 hours later with 3 transfers. Instead of arriving to my mom's home airport at 12:30pm, I didn't get in until 11:30pm during a horrible blizzard that my mom had to pick me up in and I lost an entire day with her. I will never fly out of Bisnarck again. Minot is hands down the best."
Jul 2020,40,Fight was fine. Everyone has masks on. All ok.,Everyone had masks on. Snacks were individually packed including water. Flight attendants were nice. Smooth flight.
Jul 2020,10,"Double standards, aka racism, albeit subtle in this case.","I would have given a 4 or 5 if it weren’t for the double standard of the crew.  A passenger boarded the aircraft without a mask and did not wear one during the entire flight. No one grow the crew said a thing to him.  The reason most likely has to do with him being a typical white guy and wearing the stupid Trump hat. And of course the flight attendants were both white girls.  I am almost absolutely certain if he were a minority, Things would have been totally different.  Just imagine for a moment if a black passenger showed up wearing a T-shirt with Black Life Matters written on it and is not wearing a mask. The reaction of the crew would have been, I am absolutely certain, quite different.  Not only he would have been denied boarding that flight, he would have been denied boarding future flights."
Jul 2020,50,FLight form Oklahoma City to Sacramento via Denver,"United was great to ensure the the safety of the passengers. All the protocols were followed to ensure that the Passengers were safe - in few cases they went above and beyond.    Amazing and comfortable service and I would like the people to know that its totally safe to travel, please ensure to comply to the protocols. I am not going to hold back and travel more because now that I have experienced first hand how closely they are following the cleanliness and disinfection process."
Jul 2020,10,Extremely bad staff,"So I have dual citizenships and I booked a ticket and it was from cvg to Washington and then by the Turkish airlines to go back to cyprus.  Cyprus is divided to two sides I live in the Turkish side , and this is the first time that this happens to me at the check in booth that someone asks for a proof of residency ( she first told me a student I’d would be okay then no , then she made call my friends to go get my house lease and then she said it’s not gonna work) I  And then she told me if I didn’t have a proof of residency to cyprus she won’t let me catch the plane that is going to Washington after that she asked me if I did the flight pass (the flight pass website is made from the greek side government) so she asked me to fill out a governmental form for a country that I don’t even live in ! The greek side has a different President! And I kept telling her that this is for the greek side and she wouldn’t listen ...  She made me lose my time and money for nothing  And when I called your call center to ask them about the requirements for the same trip nobody asked for anything  I have every single thing recorded.... I wish anyone in the United airlines would even care to come back to us  I feel disgusted about what happened yesterday  And not to mention when I got really mad I started crying because I want to get into that airplane but they didn’t let me for no logical and legal reason  The girls behind the booth started laughing under their masks ...  Obvious bullying"
Jul 2020,10,Pet travel misinformation lost my dog,"I was told by airline customer service that United Airlines accepts pet travel. Because my dog Sebastian only weighed 20 lbs i could carry him on the plane. I needed to get Seattle to catch a flight to Hawaii for relocation. At the airport I was told I could not take Sebastian because he was too big. Cargo was not an option because pets are suspended from cargo travel now and there are NO exceptions. I have to abandon my dog to a friend who can't keep him. If United had told me the truth I would have driven to seattle last week. I have lost my beloved dog. I am beyond devastated. I called United and they don't give a damn. They are extremely cold, cruel and uncaring. Its like they mislead me on purpose just to get ticket money."
Jul 2020,50,Very clean and efficient flights,"Flew to JH from STL for my 50th birthday last week. I just wanted to write a review about the level of cleanliness of the gate, the airplane and the efficiency of the staff from check-in to the gate agent to the crew. I am very impressed. Every surface was very clean, i was given a sanitizing wipe n each flight i boarded, (total of 5) > Masks were mandatory on board. I will encourage others who are afraid of traveling to check out United. I felt very safe."
Jul 2020,10,Poonited Airlines,"United has turned into a low-coster. I was booking a roundtrip flight and was charged an additional $50 just to book a seat that wasn't in the absolute back of the plane. Pretty soon they'll be charging for squares of toilet paper.    The concept of low cost airlines in Europe is paying 15 euros to fly from London to Barcelona. For United, it's flying from Houston to Cancun for $300 and still getting more and more money squeezed out of you at every step."
Jul 2020,50,"Okay, another good flight on United !","United Airlines is handling the pandemic and all the complications that add to the complexities of travel very well. We were loaded from the back of the plane to the front, masks on, if you are not eating or drinking keep the mask on.    Don't bunch up at the restroom etc., common sense.    The seats were 50% full, each row had an open seat or two. They handed us a very good grade of towlette with alcohol for self cleaning our touch points, during the flight they passed out small bags with a bottle of water and two snacks, Oreo's and pretzels. There was a crummy towelette in the bag also.    We wore our masks and travelled. That's all there is to it. United did what they were supposed to do, we were satisfied with the protocols and the service.    Good job United."
Jul 2020,10,Lacking covid safety,"They are not leaving one seat free between pasagers, like other airlines are doing (e.g. Alaska Airlines leaves a seat free between passages to aid with physical distancing).    Also, the attendants are allowing people to take off their masks."
Jul 2020,10,horrible supervisor,"United it’s the worse company! no refund, horrible supervisor that can’t solve problems! this company it’s just taking money from people!"
Jul 2020,40,Nov - UA5435 Phoenix to Los Angeles ERJ-175 (#N200SY) FC Seats 2C & D,"Nov - UA5435 Phoenix to Los Angeles ERJ-175 (#N200SY) FC Seats 2C & D    On Friday, November 09, we flew United Airlines UA5435, from Phoenix (PHX) to Los Angeles (LAX), as the first leg of a business trip to London (LHR), in First Class, Seats 2C & D on an EMB-175 (#N200SY), operated by SkyWest Airlines, dba United Express. This was a plane change from an EMB-175 (#118SY). This flight is a yo-yo between PHX and LAX, and the plane arrived 8 mins late into PHX, but we made up time.    As this was a late morning flight, we started the morning at the little United Club at PHX, with a glass of Champagne, and then walked down to Gate 6A in T2. This gate is part of a 3-gate configuration, that served the old Continental Airlines, and consists of Gates 6A, 6B and 8. All are a bit tightly packed together.    We boarded just a few minutes late, and had taken our seats, before Group 1 was called. On the UA EMB-175's, there are 4 rows of seats, in a 1-2 configuration, in First Class. These are designated A and then C & D, with no B seats. The overhead bins above the A seats is very small, but long ago, I realized that my small briefcase fit perfectly there - though not much else, besides a medium-sized purse will. My wife’s small wheeled-briefcase does fit nicely in the bins, above the our C-D seats (starboard side of the plane), and there is a convenient closet by the galley in FC, where our jackets were hung. My briefcase also fits easily under the seat in front, as there are no IFE mechanics taking up space there, on the EMB-175.    We like the EMB-175, and fortunately fly it often, but too often have a CRJ-200, which is not one of our favorite planes - along with the EMB-145.    These seats are quite comfortable, with good pitch, and good width, plus comfortable lower cushions, at 37"" pitch and 20"" width.. The width is slightly reduced, as the tray tables are in the fixed armrests.    In the podium, between the C & D seats, we had two AC/USB outlets, and power to charge one of my camera batteries on this flight. We did not use these on this short flight.    Due to the brief flight time, we only did a glass of the Camelot, CA Chardonnay, which is not our favorite, but UAX has had it as their white wine for years now. At least we were not forced to drink it out of the plastic bottle.    Our plane was clean, and we had no issues with the functionality of any aspect of the aircraft..    Our Flight Attendant was extremely good, and very friendly, and with her doing the safety demonstration, we did not have to sit through the Spider-Man video, on UA planes with DirectTV, or AVOD equipment. We expect to see that, on our LAX-LHR leg though.    This plane did have PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), providing streaming content to one’s personal device, and this service is free. Because of the short duration, neither of us used it. It also had WiFi (for a fee), but as neither of us used it, I cannot comment on how well it might have performed.    We landed at LAX T8 Gate 85, just a few minutes late, but we had plenty of time to get over to the LAX Polaris Lounge, in T7, before our flight to London.    In all, a very good, very short flight."
Jul 2020,40,Nov - UA935 London to Los Angeles 787-9 (#3964) Polaris Seats 1K & L,"Nov - UA935 London to Los Angeles 787-9 (#3964) Polaris Seats 1K & L    On Thursday, Nov 14, we flew United UA935 from London (LHR) to Los Angeles (LAX) on a 787-9 (#3964) in Polaris Class, seats 1K and L. This 787-9 did not have the full Polaris hard product yet, and was what I would typify as “Polaris-light.” It had the old Business Class mini-pods. These seats/pods are configured 2-2-2, and all face forward. We were flying in Row 1, so right at the forward bulkhead, and on the starboard side of the plane.    Though we had experienced good weather for the entire stay in London, this morning was gloomy, with lots of clouds, and showers starting. I was looking forward to the views on takeoff from LHR, with a bit of Autumn color, but that was not looking like it was going to happen on this flight - and I was correct. We were into the clouds so very quickly, but at least the weather did not affect our flight.    On this grey and very gloomy morning, we arrived at LHR T2 early for our 1:25pm flight, and had our luggage checked, and were through Security in about 35 mins, then walked to the Global Services Lounge, near our departure gate, B45. The Global Services Lounge is just off to the side of the lovely United Club, which was the prototype for all new, or refurbished United Clubs, and elements of it were incorporated into the Polaris Lounges. The Global Services Lounge, while small, is a more intimate version of the Polaris Clubs, and several elements from it, were also incorporated. This was once the Global First Class Lounge, and is now reserved for only Global Services fliers, and as such, has never been full - a very quiet, and peaceful oasis, hidden away in T2. We had Champagne and then some wines, along with our “cooked to order” lunch, in the little circular dining room, with a lovely glass wine display case, in the middle. I had the United Beef Slider, which was quite good, for not being fire-cooked, and my wife had the Sticky Korean Barbecue Chicken, which was also quite good. After exploring some of the wines on the list, we headed to our gate.    We were welcomed by a Global Services agent, who checked us in, and waited to be called for boarding.    We were quickly into our seats, with our briefcases, a small backpack, my wife’s purse, and my hat stored in the spacious bin above us. In Row 1 on the outboard seats, the bin is an individual, and not shared, but there was even room to put our bedding in there too. Starting in Row 2, the bins are larger, but are meant to be shared by two Rows. On this flight, I doubt that more than 50% of the bins were used.    This 787-9 had the older pods, as it had not yet been converted to the full Polaris. The term that United uses is “Polaris Business,” and the hard product is more akin to their old, now discontinued Global Business Class. I call it “Polaris-light.” We had the complete Polaris soft product, but not the new pods. United is converting their 777 fleet first, so the 787's will be done later, and in stages. To date, only a few of the 787's have been done, and most fly the Pacific long-haul routes. These Polaris Business pods are nice, but not as nice as the new full Polaris pods, or the older Global First Class Pods. Here are some of the details, and comparisons.    The Seats/Pods:  These seats fully recline into a 100% lay-flat bed, just like the two pods in the classes that Polaris “combined/replaced.” The “bed” was fairly comfortable, though its width was closer (or seemed to be) to that from the old Business units, and not the more spacious old Global FC pods, or as spacious as the FULL “real” Polaris pods, which are nicer, but still short of the Global FC pods. The recline controls are on the podium, and worked well on this plane. Here are my observations on Polaris-Light vs Full Polaris, with some Global First Class comments, thrown in:    Full aisle access from the Aisle Seats, and especially the Center Seats, as both open to an aisle – Great improvement. The full Polaris has better access for all pods/seats. As we were on the starboard side in this 2-2-2 configuration, only my wife in 1K had aisle access. I had to step over her, when she was reclined. The new full Polaris pods offer full aisle access, by their angle and configuration.    These are slightly claustrophobic – More like the old Business Class pods, and remember that there are subtle changes, in alternating rows. Arm rests do drop down, but that extra width exposes one to folk passing by in the aisle, just a bit, if in an aisle seat. In 1L, my armrest retracted, and as I only had the fuselage, I did not have to worry about being bumped.    As the fuselage begins to taper, right at Row 1, Seat 1L loses a few inches of foot room, next to the interior wall, but not enough to take note of - and besides, the footwell in the pod is slightly offset, and rather small, to begin with. I barely noticed this taper, though did photograph it for others.    Lighting changes – overhead light is good, but in seats 1K & L, a bit misplaced, and not as useful for filling in paperwork. It could also have a broader beam, as it is concentrated at the back of the tray table, when extended. We encountered this issue with our LAX-LHR flight, on our outbound leg, and in Seats 3D & E, and actually, in all of the Polaris Business seats we have had. Not sure why, but it is though the lighting was designed for a different seating arrangement, than what United chose to go with. On the UA 777's, with full Polaris, we have not encountered this lighting mis-alignment.    The tray table – Combo of slide out (on an arced track) and fold-out. OK, but a tad cumbersome.    Coat hanging clip in pod – convenient for landing. During takeoff and flight, the flight attendants store coats in closet.    Seat/bed comfort – about the same, as with the old Global Business Class units, and I recommend asking for the “mattress pad,” for a bit more cushion.    Armrests – one side did retract, for more width, but not as much, as the old Global FC pods.    Walls – higher, for more privacy – as observed in my previous reviews of United Polaris, the partitions between the middle pods on the 787 differ per alternating rows, and then between pods at the bulkheads. On this 787, Row 1's partition is the partition between 1K & L - small. Unlike the full Polaris hard product, these do not retract. These partitions alternate from small, to fairly large, by odd/even rows.    Bedding – Polaris full Saks 5th Ave soft-product – great, and an extra contour-pillow, and mattress cover, available upon request. This soft product has been the same for all of our Polaris flights - full Polaris, and Polaris-light.    Storage – Storage bins have decreased in number and definitely size, from Global FC. There are fewer places to store anything, than even in Business FC, and far fewer (number and size), than in Global FC. One gets one extra shelf, above the footwell, but that is completely inaccessible, when the seat/bed is reclined. There was an odd little shelf, immediately below the monitor, which was quite deep, but not very tall. Maybe for a laptop, as there was a USB input port on the monitor? There is also a shelf, atop the monitor in Row 1 starboard, but unlike on full Polaris planes, there is no railing. This is a low closet, and there is one for each of the Row 1 arrays, smaller ones for port side, and starboard side, then a larger one, for the middle seats. That larger closet offsets the center seats about half a row, so they are not immediately next to the outboard seats.    General seat comfort – OK, but many of the intermediate positions are not really comfortable. In these new pods, everything sort of works together, and it is difficult, to impossible, to adjust just one aspect, say the seatback only – cannot be done. There were more such controls on the Global FC pods, and more even on the full Polaris pods. I hope that these will soon be replaced.    A/VOD – Full Polaris has large, high-def, flat-screen monitors, which are an improvement over the screens from Business FC, and even Global FC. The monitors in Polaris-light are medium-rez, so an improvement, but in Full Polaris, they are better. Controls are tethered, like before, but seemed a bit “fiddley.” Programming was extensive, but as we had just done the LAX-LHR flight, not anything new for us, and the categorization a bit “odd” in places. Though I have been using similar A/VOD systems on UA flights, I had to experiment a bit more, and it seemed that choices were harder to make, but the monitors are also “touch-screen.” The A/VOD monitor is a bit far forward, to allow for touch-screen, unless the seat is fully upright, and even then, one probably has to take off their seatbelt.    “Charging ports – Nice array of AC, USB and other connections, conveniently located in pod wall, over a small shelf. AC is USA/Universal 120V standard. Earphone plug is 1-2 prong, and is located, so that cable does dangle over one’s shoulder. My 1-prong Bose QC15 worked fine, and the 2-prong UA Bose headset (power from the second prong) was good. We did not use the United Bose earphones on this flight, but on a previous flight, I tested mine, and they worked fine, though I like my Bose QC15's better. My wife used her Bose NC Earbuds, and all worked fine for her.    Amenity kit – sort of a scaled back version of the older Business FC kits. Nothing special, and a far cry from the kits once offered in Global FC. Still, OK kits. They also featured a full array of the new Sunday Riley products, replacing the Cow Shed line, no comb, which had been included for years, but they did have a little pen, unlike those on our London flights, just two months before. These kits were Star Wars themed.    Once airborne, we had warmed, scented towels, followed by the normal United Warm Mixed Nuts. We went with the Weingut Bründlmayer Grüner Veltliner L & T Langenlois-Östereich ‘17.    On our LAX-LHR flight two months before, there was but one white wine. On this flight, we had several, and tried them all. These were the same wines, as we had on our recent LHR-DEN flight:  Gunderloch Red Stone Riesling ‘16  Jean-Marc Brocard Chablis ‘17 - my favorite, along with the Grüner Veltliner  Then, for the reds, we had:  Bouchard Père & Fils Côte De Beaune Villages ‘16  Gundlach Bundschu Sonoma County Mountain Cuvée Red Wine ‘16  Hope Estate The Ripper Shiraz Western Australia ‘14 - my favorite    Our in-flight meal began about 90 mins into the flight, and consisted of:  Starter - Chilled Appetizer of Chicken, Pork and Apricot Terrine w/ sweet onion marmalade, peppers and chives - this was more appetizing, than it initially sounded, and glad that I did not pass on this one.  Salad - Mixed Greens w/ tomato and mango, served with dressing, and assorted breads - OK, but the mango + tomato was a bit odd. I got the Garlic Bread, and my wife the Oven Roll. Both were good. These were the same starters, as on that LHR-DEN flight, and must be they cycle out of LHR.  Main Course:  Mediterranean-style Chicken w/ couscous, almonds, raisins, apricots and butternut squash tajine - so glad that this was not the “Thai-style Chicken,” as we are both very, very tired of that dish. Again, this one, however, was quite good, and my wife wants to replicate in her tagine pot.  Carrot Manicotti w/ goat cheese sauce, pumpkin and fennel - this one had tempted us on that previous flight, so we ordered it. Well, it did not quite live up to the temptation, and the copywriter’s promise, but still not bad.    The other Main Course options were:  Braised Beef Short Ribs w/ porcini mushroom sauce, au gratin potatoes, roasted carrots, celery and parsnip - we have had about 50-50 results with United’s Beef Short Ribs, with some quite good, and some inedible. I was tempted to roll the dice, but the Manicotti was just OK, so I possibly regretted my decision.  Roasted Halibut w/ lobster sauce, whole-grain mustard mashed potatoes, carrots, green beans, leeks and lemon - this was what I order previously, and found it to be good. Next flight, the Manicotti will fall off the list, and it will be the Halibut (if still on the menu), or the Short Ribs.    For Dessert, I went with the International Cheese Course, but it was just a bit disappointing again. United needs to kick up the cheeses. I went with the Churchill Late Bottle Vintage Port ‘15. My wife chose a macaroon, and a bowl of the United “Signature Sundae,” from the pastry cart, plus the LBV Port.    Usually, we do not do the pre-arrival meal, but I decided that I would try it, after being pleasantly surprised in September:  Macaroni & Cheese “Pie” - Actually pretty tasty, and rather like a quiche. I was back to the Chablis, while my wife had coffee. I had encountered this dish on the previous LHR-DEN flight, and this one was just as good.  My wife did the Hamburger Wellington, which she thought was pretty good too. Usually, there is only the choice of one hot pre-arrival meal, then a cheese and fruit plate, but this flight had two choices, and both pretty good, at that.    We arrived a few minutes early into LAX, and the weather was as gloomy, as what we had left in London, but it was mostly heavy haze and smog, but with enough clouds around, to give us some big bumps on approach. We parked at gate77 in T7 at LAX, so had a short walk to our departure gate, 85, in the next door T8.    We usually take an earlier flight out of LHR, so it a bit odd to us, arriving at dark, and then arriving back home to PHX so late, after a very long (10:50 hr) flight. We had adequate time for our connection, so stopped into the Corona Beach Club, across from Gate 85, for a glass of wine. Then, it was finally home!    The entire flight was very good, and our Cabin Crew was great, as usual. A lot of the crew were senior staff, and we had flown with at least two of them before, either into, or out of LHR. It’s always nice to see familiar, friendly faces, just like the Global Services representative, who has greeted us several times before, and who caught us up on the health issues, of her counter-part, who has worked with us for years. A few of these folk are starting to feel closer than family.    At the moment, we are already booked to be back in London in December, and our outbound flight will be LAX-LHR, so we might see more of this crew?"
Jul 2020,40,Nov - UA5656 Los Angeles to Phoenix EMB-175 (#N113SY) FC Seats 2C & D,"Nov - UA5656 Los Angeles to Phoenix EMB-175 (#N113SY) FC Seats 2C & D    After our flight to LAX from LHR, on Thursday, Nov 14, we flew United Airlines UA5656 home to Phoenix (PHX), on an EMB-175 (N113SY), in First Class, in seats 2C & D. The flight was operated by Skywest Airlines, dba United Express.    We almost stopped into the United Club in T7 (where we had just arrived), but decided to go directly to T8, to be close to our departure gate, and have a glass of wine at the Corona Beach Club, right there. This had been a long day, and already with a 10:50 hr flight from London, so we were starting to drag a bit. Also, as we took a later flight out of LHR, than usual, this was also a later flight into PHX, than is our normal.    We walked over to Gate 85 (our departure gate), and boarded before Group 1, due to our status. We took our seats on the starboard side of the plane, and near the front of First Class. The EMB-175 is configured 1-2 in First Class, with 4 rows of seats, then E and E+ are 2-2. One limitation in FC is that the bins above the A seats, are tiny, but my small briefcase fits - though not much more than a medium-sized purse would. That means that all FC passengers, will mostly need the larger bins, above the C & D seats. Also, a bit of the bin real estate is used for safety equipment, at the front of the FC cabin. As those starboard bins are pretty generous, my wife’s wheeled briefcase fit easily. The EMB-175 has good underseat storage in FC, unlike several other Regional Jets in the UA fleet. Another aspect, which I like about this plane is that it has a closet, near the galley, unlike the CRJ-200/700's and the EMB-145's. As we always fly with our jackets, the closet is greatly appreciated.    We declined the pre-departure beverage, and slept through the passed snack basket, and especially as we had been well-fed on our LHR-LAX flight.    This EMB-175 had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), which is streamed for free, to one’s device, but on the short 1:24 hr flight (actual flight time was 1:15), neither of us used it. It also had WiFi, for a fee, but it went unused, as well.    We took off to heavy haze and low clouds at LAX, in the gathering gloom of evening. We were into those clouds before the 10,000' chime sounded. With nothing to see from the window, I was soon asleep, in the darkened cabin. That chime was the last thing that I heard, until we began our final approach to PHX. I am not even sure which runway we landed on, as it was dark, cloudy and hazy in Phoenix too.    We landed at PHX, on-time. We parked at Gate 3, and our luggage came out rather quickly onto Carousel 4, and we were headed home.    The short flight was good, smooth and quiet, with a good Cabin Crew (only interacted with them on boarding), and on a plane, which we have come to enjoy, the EMB-175. We strongly prefer it to the other Regional Jets in UA/UAX’s fleet."
Jul 2020,40,Nov - UA923 Los Angeles to London 787-9 (#3964) Polaris Seats 3D & E,"Nov - UA923 Los Angeles to London 787-9 (#3964) Polaris Seats 3D & E    On Friday, November 08, we flew United Airlines UA923 from Los Angles (LAX), to London Heathrow (LHR). This was on a 787-9 (#3964), in Polaris Business Seats 3D & E. This was an earlier 787-9, and had not been retro-fitted with the full Polaris layout. Going back a bit, United basically did away with Business and First Class, and combined those into Polaris, but there are still two different Polaris configurations. This one, the older version, was called “Polaris Business,” but I call it “Polaris Light.” It has the full Polaris soft product, but is still basically a business class seat/pod, which is a holdover from the old Global Business Class. The configuration in Polaris Business on this 787-9 was 2-2-2, and all forward facing. We had the interior 2 seats, side-by-side, three rows from the bulkhead. The center seats are slightly offset from the outboard rows, by about ½ a pod. I will go into more detail on the configuration, and amenities, later on. We had taken this same flight (different 787-9, but with the same configuration), in September. While we prefer to fly through SFO, when going to London, and taking United UA900 and UA930, this is not that bad a flight - but I like arriving at LHR about 2 hrs later, so that our hotel room is available. On this flight, we usually have to spend time in the bar, before getting into our room.    We had arrived at LAX from our home airport PHX (Phoenix), on a United Express flight, and as we had a very leisurely connection, we spent our time in the newly opened United Polaris Club in T7, at LAX - where the old International First Club was located - but now completely redone.    We walked down to our departure gate, 74, and were in the first group to board - just before the 1K’s, and then Group 1. We were in our pods, and got things squared away. Though in the older Polaris configuration, the overhead bins are still spacious, and we had briefcases, and then all of our bedding easily stored above our seats. Looking around the cabin, just before bin doors were closed, I would guess that only about 30% of the total overhead space was used in this forward cabin.    On this flight, there were 19 E+ seats, and 1 Polaris, showing as empty, not long before boarding. Not sure if there was a wait-list, or upgrade list, but would assume that some higher-status passengers in E, might have gotten moved forward? The flights into LHR are usually full, so seeing the empty E+ seats was a bit of a surprise to me - but then, we more often fly out of SFO, and I cannot recall any of those flights being less than 100% full. Even though we booked this flight almost 6 mos. out, all of Polaris was full, on the SFO-LHR flights, and that is why we were going via LAX.    One thing that I noticed (and we flew this same cabin configuration on similar planes twice in the previous two months), was that the seat number was displayed on each AVOD monitor screen - I had never seen that before. Nice feature.    We accepted a glass each of the pre-departure Nicolas Feuillatte Brut Reserve NV Champagne, which is not a bad choice of bubbly. Our jackets were stored in the forward closet, and we were ready for our 10:30 hr flight to LHR. We had boarded on time, and were taking off on time - always a good sign.  Now for Polaris Class on this particular 787:  Seats/Pods:  The seats fully recline into a 100% lay-flat bed, just like the two pods in the classes that Polaris “combined/replaced.” The “bed” was comfortable, though its width was closer (or seemed to me) to that from the old Business FC units, and not the more spacious old Global FC pods, or as spacious as the FULL Polaris pods, which are nicer, but still short of the Global FC pods. The recline controls are on the podium, and worked well. Here are my observations on Polaris-Light vs Full Polaris, with some Global First Class comments, thrown in:  Full aisle access – Great improvement!    Slightly claustrophobic – More like the old Business FC, and remember that there are subtle changes, in alternating rows. Arm rests do drop down, but that extra width exposes one to passengers and crew passing by in the aisle, just a bit.    Lighting changes – overhead light is good, but in seat 3E, a bit misplaced, and not as useful for filling in paperwork. I had encountered the same lighting alignment issue, in seat 1E on our previous London flight. The light should have a broader beam, as it is concentrated at the back of the tray table, when extended.    Tray table – Combo of slide out (on an arced track) and fold-out. OK, but a bit cumbersome.  Coat hanging clip in pod – convenient for landing. During takeoff and flight, the flight attendants store coats in a forward closet.    Seat/bed comfort – about the same, as with the old Global Business Class units, and I recommend asking for the “mattress pad,” for a bit more cushion.    Armrests – one side (aisle side in 3D & E) did retract, for more width, but not as much, as the old Global FC pods did.    Partitions between seats – higher, for more privacy – as observed in my previous reviews of United Polaris, the partitions between the middle pods on the 787 differ per alternating rows, and then between pods at the bulkheads. On this 787, Row 3 is an odd-numbered row, and our partition was small. On even numbered rows, the partition is larger. Unlike the full Polaris hard product, these do not retract, which is a very nice feature, when two are traveling together.    The Bedding – Polaris full Saks 5th Ave soft-product – great, and an extra contour-pillow, and mattress cover, available upon request.    Storage – Storage bins have decreased in number and definitely size, from Global FC. There are fewer places to store anything, than even in the old Business FC, and far fewer (number and size), than in Global FC. One gets one extra shelf, above the footwell, but that is completely inaccessible, when the seat/bed is reclined. There was an odd little shelf, immediately below the monitor, which was quite deep, but not very tall. Maybe for a laptop, as there was a USB input port on the monitor?    General seat comfort – OK, but many of the intermediate positions are not really comfortable. In these new pods, everything sort of works together, and it is difficult, to impossible, to adjust just one aspect, say the seatback only – cannot be done. I liked the old style seat controls, where one could make adjustments to just one aspect of the seat, and not have to accept that any change would be global for the seat.    A/VOD – Full Polaris has large, high-def, flat-screen monitors, which are an improvement over the screens from Business FC, and even Global FC. The monitors in Polaris-light are medium-rez, so an improvement, but in Full Polaris, they are much better. Controls are tethered, like before, but seemed a bit “fiddley.” Programming was extensive, but the categorization a bit “odd” in places. Though I have been using similar A/VOD systems on UA flights, I had to experiment a bit more, and it seemed that choices were harder to make, but the monitors are also “touch-screen.” The A/VOD monitor is a bit far forward, to allow for touch-screen, unless the seat is fully upright, and even then, one probably has to take off their seatbelt.    Charging ports – Nice array of AC, USB and other connections, conveniently located in pod wall, over a small shelf. AC was USA/Universal 120V standard. Earphone plug is 1-2 prong, and is located, so that cable does dangle over one’s shoulder. My 1-prong Bose QC15 worked fine, and the 2-prong UA Bose headset (power from the second prong) was good. There is no small closet-like compartment in Polaris-light, so the UA supplied Bose earphones reside in a little leather pocket in the storage area, behind the seat. On this flight I did not try the UA Bose headphones, but did on my flight two months before, and found them OK, but not up to my Bose QC15's..    Amenity kit – sort of a scaled back version of the older Business FC kits. Nothing special, and a far cry from the kits once offered in Global FC. Still, OK kits. They also featured a full array of the new Sunday Riley products, replacing the Cow Shed line, but no comb, which had been included for years. Unlike the most recent amenity kits, these did have a little pen. These had a “Star Wars” theme to them. Also, the safety video was now Star Wars themed, which was great, as we were so very, very tired of seeing the Spider-Man themed video. The AVOD roster had a full compliment of Star Wars films, so I re-visited that franchise, and also caught up with the most recent releases. Over the decades, I must have either missed more, than I was aware of, or had forgotten much. I did not have time to even check out other video offerings, as I never finished Star Wars, but have my return flight from this trip, plus another London trip, next month.    The overhead bins were quite spacious, and our two briefcases, a small backpack, my wife’s purse and my hat, all fit easily. There was even room to store the bed linens, until needed. Our jackets were hung in the forward closet.    Once airborne, we had warmed, scented towels, followed by the normal United Warm Mixed Nuts. We moved to the still white wine, which was the Concannon Monterey County Chardonnay ‘15, the Gunderloch Red Stone Riesling ‘17, and also the Terras Gauda O Rosal Rias Baixas Blanca ‘16.    For dinner, we had a very similar menu, as we had on that Sept, 02 flight, but there were a few differences too.  We started dinner with:  Chilled Appetizer of Thai-styled lemon grass shrimp w/ mango slaw - this was a nice starter, and the shrimp were very tasty. This was the same as in September.  Salad of spinach (instead of Napa & red cabbage), carrot and mango, served with dressing, and assorted breads - pretty good salad, so we were on a roll here..  My Main Course was: Seared Turbot (changed from Hake before) Fish Fillet w/ tomato caper sauce, steamed white and wild rice, stir-fried bell pepper, carrot and onion. This was another tasty fish dish out of LAX - so far, all have been quite good.  My wife had the Seared Beef Short Ribs w/ Bordelaise sauce, mustard mashed potatoes, roasted carrots and parsnips. We have had mixed results with the Short Ribs, but this was a good version, and slightly different preparation, from the Sept. flight.    During the flight, and starting with my meal I explored the other wine options, with the Château Greysac Bordeaux blend, Gravières du Roy ‘12, Samur-Champigny ‘16 and Benzinger Sonoma County Merlot ‘14. All were good, and the Merlot went well with the Beef Short Rib.    The other Main Course options were:  Spicy Thai-style Chicken w/ coconut ginger broth and udon noodles - we get a version of this dish on United’s domestic routes, and have grown very, very tired of it - besides the sauce is almost always too sweet.  Ginger & Butternut Squash Mezzaluna w/ coconut cream sauce, lemon grass, ginger and lime, a Thai basil and cilantro purée plus butternut squash. This sounded good, and was tempting, especially as we were into Autumn - maybe on the return flight?    I opted for the International Cheese Assortment, and a glass of the Churchill LBV Port ‘14, while my wife went for an Apple Tart and a Brownie. She thought that both were quite good, and especially with the Port.    There was a pre-arrival meal of:  Caprese Omelet w/ Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese and roasted tomatoes  Or Seasonal Fruit w/ cereal and milk  We declined on both, and only had coffee, especially as we had lunch planned already in London, plus a rather early dinner.    We left LAX with high clouds and haze, hit a few bumps on the way out, then had a smooth flight, until our initial approach to LHR, where we picked up some more bumps. We had some clouds at LHR, but otherwise, fine weather.    Our entire Cabin Crew was a delight, and we wanted for nothing. They were efficient, and quite cheerful. The Purser personally thanked us for being Global Services, and flying United (like 208 flights with them each, in 2018).    We landed a bit early, after a direct approach into LHR (no circling the City on this flight, but then we were seated inboard, so would have missed the views anyway), and we were off for the long walk to Immigration and Customs in T2. With the newish Passport scanners, we were through Immigration in moments - there was no line, and though 1 of those kiosks was out of service, we had two units ready for us. The luggage was fairly quick to come out, and with “Nothing to Declare,” we just waltzed through Customs, heading to the taxi queue, down one level. The longest wait of the entire process, other than the long walk, was for the elevator/lift, to get to the lower level. There was no queue for a cab, so we were quickly off to our hotel, the Conrad St James, after only moments with Immigration and Customs. At least in T2 at LHR, the entry process is very quick now, taking no more than about 30 mins. total. The walk from the gate, is almost that long.    A very nice flight, with zero complaints."
Jul 2020,50,Clean And Comfortable,"Today I flew on a United Express EMB-175 from Sarasota to Chicago. The cleanliness on board was amazing, they handed us wipes which made it even more clean since we wiped down everything. Service in first class was a snack box and drink. The snack box, while not as good as the normal meals, was absolutely stunning for a pre packaged snack. We had a delay for a maintenance issue but other than that it was a great experience."
Jul 2020,20,COVID-19 Safety,"I traveled with my family recently but United safety measures were not as we expected. They don't care if passengers were wearing masks or not during the flight. So many ppl just walking without mask. Middle seat is filled as well. I travelled with Delta and it was much better and safer, they always remind passengers to keep mask on."
Jul 2020,10,handling of pandemic,"With the pandemic lockdown all over US and the world, United Airlines has been emailing customers that they will handle the situation with a excellent and superb customer consideration in mind, only to find out that they are not giving any refunds. I called the customer service and all they can say is they are NOT considering pandemic as a refund situation - what UNITED? are you really serious? You wanna hold on to customers money and be so ultra-inconsiderate of what is going on with the world? Las Vegas is a lockdown city and United wants me to go on with my trip ??? and not eligible for a refund?? What has happened to your ultra customer-is-our-number-one-priority slogan?"
Jul 2020,20,What is going on with flight prices?,"I just started searching for a September flight and was happy to see the fares were reasonably priced albeit in basic economy. I usually search that way first and then upgrade after I find a suitable itinerary to Premium Economy. Well, imagine my surprise when an upgrade that used to cost between $50 and $100 last year now almost quadruples the price!  What the hell is going on? There is no way I am paying those kind of prices for a seat that used to be standard fare not all that long ago."
Jul 2020,30,In flight entertainment,The in-flight entertainment freezes and stutters like every 20 seconds it’s not even watchable please fix this
Jul 2020,30,Polaris in 787-9,"First time flying international with United in Polaris Business. Price was high for what you get at this time with respect to service, food and drink during COVID.  The seat was comfortable and you get your flat bed, however, it is not as well designed as some other Business class seats. The foot rest is small, the storage is adequate but inconvenient in its location. In seat power for charging your electrical devices. Provided with two pillows (one memory foam and one standard synthetic filled) you have a blanket and ""quilt"" for your bed and are provided with pyjamas and an amenity kit.  Due to COVID the food and drink service was far from what I am used to in Business Class. The dinner meal was a choice of three options, I took the steak which was all packaged and sealed, but taste was fine. The only option for drinks was wine, beer or soft drink. There were no spirits or other drinks offered. Water was available and some snacks, but very limited variety. Breakfast was similarly packaged - filled a hole but not the normal expectation I would have in Business. It would be interesting to try again in normal times.  Seats were arranged in 2-2-2 and I was in the middle row as no windows available. If you fly window seat with a person next to you then you have to step over them to get out of your seat - a poor design compared to other business class offerings.  Slightly annoying - screen controller was easy to press with your leg and would shut off the TV or have other effects."
Jul 2020,40,Oct - UA1280 Phoenix to Chicago 737-900ER (N38467) FC Seats 3A & B,"Oct - UA1280 Phoenix to Chicago 737-900ER (N38467) FC Seats 3A & B    On Tuesday, October 29, we flew United Airlines UA1280 from PHX to ORD on a 737-900ER (N38467) in First Class, seats 3A & B. This was for several meetings that my wife had, in Chicago.    We started our morning began at the United Club in T2 at PHX Airport. We flew out of Gate 6B, which was one of the old Continental gates, before the merger with United Airlines. Until recently, that meant that we would be flying on sCO metal, with an sCO crew, but this plane was from the United side of the merger, with no DirectTV, which translates to more foot room under the seat. This was also one of the newer 737-900W’s, with the “Dreamliner” lighting and ceiling, which meant larger overhead bins - but my wife’s small, rolling briefcase fit very nicely. Our jackets and overcoats were hung in the closet, across from the galley.    We taxied out from T2, and took off on Runway 7L, so were pointed toward ORD from the start. We were approximately 26 minutes late for takeoff, due to our plane arriving late at PHX.    We took off to very light haze in the Phoenix Area, which increased a bit, not too long after leaving PHX. The weather at ORD was looking lousy, when we took off, and we were expected to encounter lots of clouds on our way..    We were in our seats quickly, and ordered sparkling wine (Ca’ di Rajo Mitō), for the pre-departure beverage.    Our plane had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) for free, featuring content streamed to one’s personal device via the United App - NOTE: one must have the latest UA App, and have it installed BEFORE the doors close. We did watch a bit of the content, but we had flown so much in the past few months, that I think I had seen all that I really wanted to see. My wife did find some TV programs, that were of interest to her. This service is free. We also had WiFi, for a price, but did not use it. As forecast, the haze did increase, as did the clouds, and I was wishing that I had not seen so much of the programing on United - or that they had made major changes. With little to see out of the window, this was going to be a long flight. On both the PHX to DEN and ORD flights, we often get some views of the Painted Desert, but those were very few, and far between, on this flight. We did get to see some Autumn snow in New Mexico and Colorado though.    This 737-900 had 5 rows in First Class, in a 2-2 configuration. The FC seats are 21"" wide, with a 38"" pitch, which provides plenty of legroom. While the FC seats are fine, and fairly comfortable, we have grown fond of the FC seats in the Airbus A-319/320's, which were refurbished about 5 years ago, across the fleet.    This flight had lunch served in First Class. It started out with warmed mixed nuts. Lately, whether we have gotten those, varies by the flight to Chicago - about half we do, and on half we do not? We had our choices of:  Cheese & Crackers (in a new container) - decent cheeses, and fresh crackers with some assorted fruit.  Tandori-style Chicken w/ tofu and basmati rice - one of the better, recent dishes, and much better, than the variations on Thai-style meals, which we find too sweet.    Both came with a Spinach Salad w/ crumbled Feta, a bread and Strawberry Cheesecake.    The wines were the M Napa Chardonnay, and the Tall Sage Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. Both are nice wines at 30,000'.    Most of the mid-section of the country was under heavy clouds, and when we finally broke below those, Chicago was quite hazy, but we did get to see a bit of Autumn color. Our approach to ORD was direct, so no fly-over of Lake Michigan, or the Chicago skyline, but being a rather gloomy day, we did not think that we had missed all that much.    We landed at ORD about 20 mins late, but as Chicago was our final destination, that was not of issue to us. Our luggage was out rather quickly, and we were off to my wife’s first meeting.    In all, a very good flight, with a good crew, and Gate Agents at PHX. Being slightly off-schedule was not an issue for us, as we did not need to connect at ORD, for onward travel."
Jul 2020,40,Oct - UA1603 Chicago O’Hare to Phoenix 737-800W (#3246) FC Seats 3A & B,"Oct - UA1603 Chicago O’Hare to Phoenix 737-800W (#3246) FC Seats 3A & B    On Wednesday, Oct 30, we flew UA1603 from Chicago (ORD) home to Phoenix (PHX) on a 737-800W (#3246), in First Class, seats 3A & B. The weather in Chicago had turned awful, and our drive from downtown, out to ORD was slow. We arrived without a lot of time to spare, so rushed to our departure gate, C-10A, just before boarding began. I was so glad to be Global Services and have both Clear and TSA Pre-Check, as we were now pressed for time. I think that United was as anxious as we were, to get out of Chicago, as boarding was very quick, and we were in our seats quickly, with our jackets and overcoats hanging in the forward closet, across from the galley.    We settled back with a glass of sparkling wine (never noticed the label), and exhaled, waiting to hear that our flight was going to be placed on Ground Hold, due to the weather - but that announcement never came.    This 737-800 was from the Continental side of the merger, and had both the new interior, with larger overhead bins, and “Dreamliner” lighting, but also DirectTV. The one drawback of DirectTV is that the equipment takes up a lot of underseat real estate, but my small briefcase, and hat fit OK. My wife’s small, wheeled briefcase fit easily in the large overhead bins. As there was likely little to be seen outside my window, I was glad to have the DirectTV, and hoped that it worked for the entire flight - on two recent flights (to/from ORD, by the way), the DirectTV malfunctioned, and could not be restarted.    The United 737-800W (738) is comfortable in First Class, with 4 rows of 2-2 seats, with a pitch of 38"" and a width of 21"". Now, as mentioned, the DirectTV equipment does occupy some of the foot well, but still the pitch is adequate. We are less fond of the First Class in the 737's, and prefer what United did, when they refurbished their AirBus fleet, with completely new seats in the First Class cabin. Oddly, we recently flew a 737-800 with those seats, plus DirectTV (so from the sCO fleet), but it had the old-style, smaller overhead bins - that was a bit of an oddity for us, with elements of the sCO 737's, but with the seats from the Airbus?? Though we fly United weekly, we have only seen that plane once.    We departed ORD pretty much on-time, which was a bit of a miracle, with the deteriorating weather.    After takeoff, we had warmed Mixed Nuts and the M Napa Chardonnay. Oddly, on about half of our recent flight into, and out of ORD, we have not gotten the nuts, but on both our PHX-ORD and now our ORD-PHX flights, we have.    As this was a “dinner flight,” we had the choice of:  Chicken over Noodles, or Ranchero Chicken Salad. Both were pretty good, and this Ranchero Chicken Salad was much better than the various Thai-styled Salads, we have had recently. The former came with a very nice, crisp mixed salad, and both came with bread and a Chocolate Cheesecake. Of the United Cheesecake variations, and I think we have had them all, this is my least favorite, though the Strawberry version is a close second to the worst.  We stuck to the Chardonnay, for the flight.    We had climbed above the storm front, and noticed that to the west and south of Chicago, it had already dumped quite a bit of snow - glad that we got out, when we did. Halloween in Chicago was going to be cold, and snowy.    So far, the DirectTV was still working, and mercifully, as there was not much to see below - when I could see below. Other than some bumps on our climb out, the rest of the flight was calm, and uneventful.    We got a hint of clearing, over Colorado and New Mexico, and could see that some areas had gotten a pretty significant snowfall. Some of the views were nice, with the setting sun. Maybe I did not need DirectTV so much, after all?    Our flight was very nice, and we had flown with two members of the cabin crew before - the Purser, at least three times before. The Gate Agents at ORD were very good, and quite efficient with the loading of our plane, under the threat of bad weather.    We did a bit of a fly-by of Phoenix, as we landed on Runway 7L, in the gathering dusk.    We landed at PHX on time, at Gate 6A in T2, with our luggage out onto Carousel 4 fairly quickly. We had time to do a washing, and repack, before flying out to London in a few days."
Jul 2020,10,United Airlines will not refund international ticket,I canceled my flights with Untied scheuled in JULY due to NO internatioal travel being permitted. NOW they will not refund my tickets. They will only give me a travel vouture.  They are thieves. I have called multiple times and they just give you the run around.
Jul 2020,10,Baggage,I am flying to Houston for a wedding. I have a luggage the size of a carry on & didn’t think anything of it when I bought my ticket. I did not know that with basic economy you don’t even get an option to bring a carry on. My flight was already changed to 12:30 from my initial 10am arrival flight but I had to take it because my sisters wedding dinner starts at 3!! I called & there isn’t even an option anymore to upgrade my flight because it’s full. But I’m sure the cabin space isn’t! I will be forced to pay $40 to & from Houston for a bag half full but I don’t want to ball my bridesmaids dress up in a backpack just to not pay the fees! How do completely strip a customers option to bring their luggage on the aircraft if there is room & capability to do so. I will never fly United Airlines again because of this reason alone
Jul 2020,10,Don't Fly United During Covid-19,"Sure you can book united if you want, but don't plan on going anywhere. They will cancel your flight to or from your destination all together within 30 days of your departure and they will lie to you about who they partner with.    IE In early June they Cancelled our departure Flight from Springfield to St. Thomas VI and the representative actually helped us get a flight via Delta to St. Thomas. She was nice, polite and helpful.    But:    They then moved our returning Flight from St. Thomas, well cancelled it all together. I called, ""Princess""(yeah) and her supervisor both lied and stated they have no partnership with Delta. Oh and I could cancel my flight returning but that would also cancel my flight to Saint Thomas VI, which I now can't rebook. I should have gone with Delta to begin with.    I don't often leave upset reviews, but it was quite clear that United didn't want to help."
Jul 2020,10,UNITED IS A JOKE!,"Our flight was originally booked for Sunday, June 21st. Upon arriving to the airport and waiting to board, we were told the plane air conditioner was broken and we not be flying out as scheduled. We were told that we could wait for the next plane, which would arrive in Durango at 7pm and then fly to Denver, however, we would not be able to fly out of Denver to San Diego until Tuesday because all of their connecting flights were booked. Due to this extreme inconvenience, we had to rent a car for 2 days, pay for a hotel for 2 days and we both missed out on two days of work. The total out of pocket expenses for us near $1,500.00. I tried speaking to a representative about it and was told everyone was too busy and I had to email my concern. 6 days later, I received a reply that we would both be receiving $100 flying credit. $100?!!!! What an insult!!! I called again to state that this is unacceptable and guess what, I was told I had to email my request. We lost out on almost $1500 due to UNITED. What a joke!"
Jul 2020,10,Do NOT fly united if you have a disability!,"I'm a wheelchair user and we had seats towards the front of the plane that we were happy with. But United thought it was a great idea to put us towards the back of the plane because they like people who are disabled in the back rather than in the front. When we asked if we could change to the original seats that were assigned to us they refused to put us back where we were supposed to be seated. (on one flight with them we were put in the middle of the plane and we were originally assigned a seat at the front and when we got onboard the seats that were originally assigned to us were empty for the WHOLE flight and the flight was nearly full so they could have put us there they just did not want to.) Do NOT fly united if you are a wheelchair user or if you have a disability because they will most likely NOT accommodate people with special needs. I was also supposed to board first because I'm in a wheelchair and I need an aisle chair to board the plane and they let other customers onboard before us and that pissed me off because every other airline I fly with would ALWAYS put me on first before others would board (before COVID and during). The only thing that was a postive for me was the legroom but nothing else. I'm glad the next time I fly, that I will fly delta because they are the best in my opinion for people who have special needs."
Jun 2020,40,Made reservations through JustFly but had to have United fix them,"Made the reservations Feb. 2019 with JustFly. With the China Flu Europe will be shutdown past our reservation time. Tried using the JustFly web page to re-book for next year. The submit button is not working or JustFly web system is overloaded. I tried cancelling the flights on several times over a three week period without success. Finally called United directly and within 5 minutes everything was fixed. You may think you are getting a better deal with JustFly, but after paying their hidden fee and total lack of customer service, I'd look at just booking with the airline. I would choose united. Just bring a pillow to sit on."
Jun 2020,10,Misinformed by staff and then made to pay for baggage,"I spoke to a representative on the phone about bring a bicycle on my flight. I was told that as long as the box was not over 62 long or over 50 ponds I could pay $35 to check it. I get to the airport and I'm charged $150. If I was told that I would have been prepared but that was more than I paid for my flight! I recalled the person I spoke to and the time and date but everyone I spoke to, 3 different people, told me I should have looked on line for the restrictions and said that I could request my money back online. I did so and received a response basically saying too bad and we will correct our representative. I will NEVER fly with them again. To me this was a simple fix. credit me to my next flight make me pay for an extra bag fine but when you can bring a surf board, longer for free but not a box that I was told was fine F that."
Jun 2020,10,"Spent $1,373.20 on a first class ticket","Required wearing a mask (thank you) but no social distancing. Someone sat right next to me on every flight. No pre-flight beverage service, only one small bottle of water and a snack box (hardly first class)"
Jun 2020,10,Maskless United flight attendants,"When even flight attendants don't wear masks, they obviously don't require passengers to do so either. This was AFTER United announced that all passengers would be required to wear masks. Female flight attendant allowed maskless male passenger to stand, and at times sit, directly behind us (last row) for 2 hrs of the flight, requiring other passengers to pass within inches of both in order to use the restroom. On the plus side, the passenger did get her phone number. Did not feel safe flying Unitef."
Jun 2020,10,Horrible Service,Changed our seats even though we explicitly paid for our seats to travel next to each other. Made us put our carry on bags as checked bags even though they were clearly small enough and had enough room. Flight attendants were rude and abrupt with baggage and service. Sanitary services due to COVID were awful and not organized. Will never fly united airlines again.
Jun 2020,10,Disgusting service,"First being told by the agent at check-in that we were not on their flights and to ""go away"". Really! So we checked our documents and with our agency in a bit of a panic as this was a long flight. Then with our agent online went back and the agent then said she found the tickets and ""put the phone down, put the phone down"". So we were given our boarding passes but as we walked away realised she had put us in economy for the first flight. No explanation. When we went back it was essentially, you are lucky you have the second flight business class!!  So beware, after lots of letters and months we were told: ""I'm sorry that we can't agree on how to best resolve this situation. We always want to reach a mutual understanding, and apologize for how this experience made you feel....We appreciate your business and look forward to providing you with the service you expect and deserve on a future United flight."" So obviously their idea of the service we expect and deserve after paying for business seats and getting summarily dumped in economy is different than most would expect.  The chance of us taking United again are slim to non. By the way this happened pre Covid. I certainly think this airline needs to review its processes, and the fact airlines can have practices like this is disgusting."
Jun 2020,10,Evil Airlines,"United Airlines is evil. The CDC said i (based on age etc) should not fly so I proactively canceled. United later canceled these flights too. They refuse to refund my payment! They will lose most more than the price of my ticket because I’ll avoid flying them and I’ll tell everyone not to. I’ve flown them in the past too, they suck in all aspects."
Jun 2020,40,Oct - UA574 San Francisco to Phoenix A-319 (#4032) FC Seats 2A & B,"Oct - UA574 San Francisco to Phoenix A-319 (#4032) FC Seats 2A & B    On Tuesday, October 22, we were back out to SFO Airport, for our homeward flight to Phoenix. We flew United flight UA574, on an AirBus A-319 ($4032) in First Class, Seats 2A & B. Our plane had arrived from SNA on-time, so the schedule was looking very good.    We have come to really like the First Class seats in the United AirBus A-319/320 ships. They were all redone a few years back, and are very comfortable - more comfortable, than on United’s 737's.    We stopped into the United Club, after we arrived for our 7:00pm departure, and then made our way to Gate F-3 (the new gate naming system*), to board. At promptly 6:25pm, boarding began, and due to our status, we boarded before 1K and Group 1. We were in our seats, before anyone else came aboard, with our jackets hanging behind the Row 3 seats, on the bulkhead.    * The old “West Pier” at T3 SFO is now the F-Gates, and the “East Pier” has the E-Gates, so the 60's, through 90 Gates are no more. It will take a bit for us to get used to the gate numbers, and this trip was a start to that.    The FC cabin is 2-2, where E/E+ is 3-3. The A-320 has 3 rows of seats in FC, with a 39"" pitch, and a 20.5"" width. In E+, the pitch is 35"", with a width of 17.7"", while E has a pitch of 30"", and the same width. The FC seats were all replaced a few years back, and we find them to be very nice, and comfortable, though in the full upright position, there is still a bit of recline built in. These seats recline into their shell, by allowing the lower cushion to slide forward, reclining the back cushion, with little intrusion into the area behind. There is a marble-topped podium, and then useful pockets all around each seat, though those cannot be used for storage for takeoff, or for landing. We had ample AC outlets, so charged a few devices, when we were above 10,000'. The tray tables also have a holder, into which an iPad fits nicely, though it is slightly offset, due to the articulation of the tray table.    This ship was equipped with the PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) which streams audio and video via the United App. That worked well on the short flight. It also had WiFi for a charge, but neither used it, on this short flight.    The weather at SFO was good, as was the weather at PHX, so we expected a fairly smooth flight - but a dark one, as the sun had already set, before we were on the taxiway.    Our Cabin Crew was very good, but we declined any more wine, or the passed snack basket, as we were ready to get home. Our luggage came out on Carousel 4, fairly quickly, and we were on our way."
Jun 2020,40,Oct - UA1609 Phoenix to San Francisco 737-800 (#3208) FC Seats 4E & F,"Oct - UA1609 Phoenix to San Francisco 737-800 (#3208) FC Seats 4E & F    On October 20, we flew from our home airport in Phoenix (PHX) to San Francisco (SFO), on a 737-800SFP (#3208) in First Class, Seats 4E & F.    We were early, and were through TSA Security quickly, and headed for the little United Club, in T2 at PHX Airport, near Gate 5 - our departure gate, at the time. This club would be closing soon, as United is moving their operations to the newly remodeled Terminal 3, and T2 will soon be closing. It was nice to see the United Club decorated for Halloween. There are usually various decorations at the gates too, but only Gate 3 really gives the staff much to work with. The others are rather crowded.    Our incoming plane (from DEN) was delayed, but not for all that long. Also, as San Francisco was our final destination, we did not have a connection at SFO to worry about. We just spent time in the United Club, waiting patiently.    We boarded before the 1K and Group 1 passengers, due to our status, and were quickly in our seats, with our jackets hanging in the closet by the galley. This late morning flight was almost full, with about 5 E+ seats available, and 3 in E. First Class was completely full. We chose the Ca di Rijo Mitō sparkling wine as our pre-departure beverage, and then had the Tunnel of Elms California Chardonnay by Beringer. We had encountered their Cabernet Sauvignon on United flights, but this was the first time seeing the Chardonnay, and it was not bad. In-flight, we had a passed snack basket, but declined.    This plane was one of the older 737-800's, with the smaller overhead bins. Those bins are adequate for my wife’s rolling briefcase, but the bins on the newer 737's are much nicer, and larger. My small briefcase fit under the seat in Row 3, but just barely. The plane was from the Continental side of the merger, and had DirectTV, which takes up some underseat real estate. I did notice that it had the new United livery/logo, and the new dark blue winglets. We have seen this new livery several times, but think that this was the first time we had flown on a ship, sporting it. Unfortunately, because of the layout of Gate 5, I could not get a full shot of it.    We took off on Runway 7L, and flew over the ASU campus, then did a big loop, back toward SFO, passing back over PHX Airport. The morning was very hazy, with lots of high clouds, so I knew that at least on takeoff, there were not be that many pretty scenes out of my window.    On this flight, the DirectTV worked fine, where as on three recent United flights, on sCO 737's, it malfunctioned. I actually watched a bit of news, as the haze and clouds, were not good for views of the ground below us.    On the United 737-800's, there are four rows of 2-2 in First Class, and the seats have a pitch of 38"", and a width of 21"". Both are quite adequate, even with the underseat space lost to the IFE equipment. In E+, it 37"" of pitch, with a width of 17.3"" in a 3-3 configuration. Economy is 31"" pitch (so 6"" less leg/knee room), with the same 17.3"" seat width.    Around mid-flight, we got some clearing, up with an odd high layer of what looked like clouds and smoke. We then picked up more clouds, as we got closer to San Francisco. We took what the pilots refer to as “the surfer’s route,” heading to Moss Landing, on the Coast, before vectoring over San Jose, for final approach into SFO. Usually, this provides a nice fly-by of the Coast, but the fog was rolling in. We did get a look at San Francisco, coming in on Runway 28L It was a slightly hazy day at SFO too, but nicer than what we left in Phoenix.    We were only about 25 mins late, and we parked at Gate E-11. This was the new gate numbering system at SFO, and before the flight, the United App had warned us of the change - but I had also been advised of it on the San Francisco Forum, on TripAdvisor. Our luggage was fairly quickly out onto Carousel 2, and we were off to the city, for my wife’s meetings.    The Gate Agents at PHX were excellent, as always, and our Cabin Crew was very good. Other than being slightly behind schedule for United, all was fine, and the later arrival had zero impact on us."
Jun 2020,40,Oct - UA1638 Phoenix to Houston 737-900W (#3407) FC Seats 3A & B,"Oct - UA1638 Phoenix to Houston 737-900W (#3407) FC Seats 3A & B    We flew United UA1638 from Phoenix (PHX) to Houston (IAH), on Friday, October 11, on a 737-900W (#3407) in First Class, Seats 3A & B, as the first leg of a leisure trip to New Orleans. We were connecting at IAH, for our second leg, on to MSY.    We started our morning in the United Club, down by Gate 7, in T2 at PHX, and then walked down to our departure gate, Gate 6B. Gate 6B, is one of the old Continental gates (6A, B and 8), from before the merger. That often means that the plane will be from the Continental side of the fleet, though lately, there are fewer distinctions.    We walked over to the gate, and were boarded before Group 1, due to our status, and quickly in our seats. This flight had only 5 vacant seats, and those were all in E+, and Exit Row seats. I assume that with 11 folk on the stand-by list, someone with seniority/status got moved up, but that meant that 6 people likely did not make the flight.    Our jackets were hung in the closet, across from the galley, and we were ready for our flight.    We took off on Runway 7L, into a slightly hazy sky. That haze intensified, as we vectored toward the Southeast, toward Houston. Fairly quickly, the haze increased, as did the clouds, and those got heavy, the closer we got to IAH.    This 737-900, was from the Continental side of the fleet, and had an older cabin, and smaller overhead bins, but wife’s wheeled briefcase fit nicely. My briefcase fit under the seat in front, but had to go in the middle section, as the IFE (DirectTV) equipment took up quite a bit of that underseat real estate. On this flight, the DirectTV functioned fine, where as on two flights, just the week before, both malfunctioned..    During this flight, there was a snack served. About 45 mins into the flight, we had a “snack,” for breakfast, with a choice of:  Egg Frittata w/ spinach, and a tomato/pepper sauce - also not bad, and a common breakfast “snack” out of PHX on UA flights lately.  Or a bowl of cold cereal w/ milk - how good can a bowl of cereal be? Usually, we get one of each, but neither of us wanted the cold cereal, so got the Frittata - not bad, but a bit heavy on the smoked pepper sauce this time. As we had a decent layover at IAH, and like a seafood restaurant there, we just nibbled a bit.  Both came with the Chobani Yogurt (strawberry blend), a small fruit bowl, and one’s choice of bread.    The closer we got to Houston, the more dense the haze, until we hit a storm front, and just went into the clouds, only to exit, before our final approach.    We landed pretty much on-time, and arrived at Gate E-3, so headed for Pappadeaux, for lunch and good wines. Our departure for New Orleans was scheduled to be from E-9, so plenty of time.    The Gate Agents at PHX were great, and the Flight Attendants were excellent on this flight - and the DirectTV worked for a change!"
Jun 2020,40,Oct - UA520 New Orleans to Houston 737-900 (#3817) FC Seats 4E & F,"Oct - UA520 New Orleans to Houston 737-900 (#3817) FC Seats 4E & F    We flew UA520 from New Orleans (MSY) to Houston (IAH) on October 13, on a 737-900 (#3817) in First Class, in seats 4E & F.    Since we were likely not going to ever fly out of the old terminal at MSY, with the new one opening, before our next visit to New Orleans, we stopped into Barboter, at the end of the D Concourse, and probably for the last time - unless they open in the new terminal.    We were at Gate D-5, just steps away, before boarding, and then boarded before Group 1, due to our status. We were in our seats, and had our jackets hanging in the little closet across from the galley, before anyone else was aboard. We both got Ginger Ale for our pre-departure beverage.    This plane was doing a yo-yo between IAH and MSY, and the cockpit crew knew the weather, as they had just flown through it. It was also one of the newer 737's, with the “Dreamliner” ceiling and lighting, and the larger overhead bins in First Class. However, this plane had seen some wear and tear, and the seat back in Row 3, looked like it had been scratched by a leopard. However, everything worked fine.    This 737-900 had 5 rows in First Class, in a 2-2 configuration, then 7 rows (port side) and 8 (starboard) of 3-3 in E+, with 16 rows of 3-3 in Economy. The FC seats are 21"" wide, with a 38"" pitch, which provides plenty of legroom. The FC seats are fine, and fairly comfortable, but we have grown fond of the FC seats in the Airbus A-319/320's, which were refurbished about 5 years ago, across the fleet.    Though the sky to the north was darkening, we took off in nice weather, though did go through a cloud bank over Lake Pontchartrain, which is very common. We broke out of those clouds after turning to the west, over about Norco, LA, and caught a glimpse of the Mississippi River - but were then back into the clouds, until we were starting our final approach into IAH.    This plane had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), which is a streaming service to one’s device, and is free. It requires that one have the latest United App, but that program is so useful, if one flies United, that they should have it installed anyway. On this short flight, we did not use it. We also had WiFi, for a fee, but did not use that either.    During the short flight, there was a passed snack basket, and also drinks, but we declined both, as we were going to eat on the second leg, IAH to PHX.    The flight was quite good, and the Gate Agents at MSY were very good, as were the members of the cabin crew. We arrived with plenty of time to connect to our flight home, to Phoenix."
Jun 2020,40,Oct - UA2256 Houston to Phoenix 737-900 (#3821) FC Seats 4E & F,"Oct - UA2256 Houston to Phoenix 737-900 (#3821) FC Seats 4E & F    On Sunday, October 13, we flew home to Phoenix (PHX) from Houston (IAH), where we had flown in from MSY, just over an hour before. We had arrived at Gate C-3, and were departing from Gate C-6 (changed from C-8). I was glad that we did not have far to go, but did have adequate time to make it. Several days before, we had taken this same flight, IAH-PHX, when returning from a trip to the Great Smoky Mountains, and had about the same connection, but then arrived at the B Concourse, so did have to take the SkyTrain - not this time.    We boarded a few minutes late, just before Group 1, and were seated, with our jackets hanging in the forward closet. We had our pre-departure sparkling wine, and settled back for the 2:48 hr flight home to Phoenix.    This 737-900, from the United side of the fleet, so had PDA with content streamed to one’s device, through the United App for free. We did not use it, so cannot comment on either it, or on the WiFi (for a fee). Not having the DirectTV frees up quite a bit of space, for one’s small cases, etc, under the seat in front of them. This was also a newer 737, with the “Dreamliner” ceiling and lighting, and the enlarged overhead bins. My wife’s small, wheeled briefcase fit easily, and my briefcase fit below the Row 3 seat in front of me.    Being under 3 hours (by just a bit), and in the afternoon, our snacks were a bit limited:  Southwest Chicken Salad, which was not bad, or the Cheese Plate, with cheeses, nuts and some dried fruit - sort of bleak, but OK. These were the same snacks, which we have gotten on several flights between PHX and IAH. The wines were the M Chardonnay, and Tunnel of Elms (by Beringer) Merlot, which is fairly new to the United wine line up.    After breaking out above the clouds over New Mexico, our flight was quite smooth, all of the way into PHX, though we did pick up some haze, starting about the AZ-NM line. There were a few clear spots near El Paso, so we got to see some of the surrounding mountains, and desert, but then back into clouds/haze, until almost the AZ line. Our approach was straight in on Runway 25R, along Tempe Town Lake. We arrived within 9 mins. of schedule, parked at Gate 5, and had our luggage out onto Carousel 4 rather quickly. As this will likely be the last time that we fly into PHX T2, I took the time to look around. The new United gates at T3 will be opening very soon, but the United Club will be rather much later.    The gate agents at IAH were fine, and the cabin crew was very good, and our service was excellent."
Jun 2020,40,Oct - UA1131 Houston to New Orleans A320 (#4616) FC Seats 2A & B,"Oct - UA1131 Houston to New Orleans A320 (#4616) FC Seats 2A & B    After connecting at Houston (IAH), on Friday, October 11, we flew UA1131 to New Orleans (MSY) on an A320 (#4616), in First Class, seats 2A & B. Though I did not know it, until we boarded, this plane had a special livery - the “Friend Ship” livery, from 1971, to celebrate United Airlines’ 85th anniversary. By my count, this is the third time we have flown this plane, but I have never gotten a great photo of it, as we have mostly flown it into New Orleans, and arrived at Gate 3, which does not have a good view from the terminal to the stand. It has not been, until we have boarded, that I have seen the plaque, explaining the paint scheme. Maybe for flights, that we do often, I need to check the number of the aircraft, earlier, to see if we have flown an interesting ship. We also have seen this plane at LAX twice, but were not flying it on those days - just saw it parked at T7, below the United Club at LAX. Personally, I like seeing the retro livery, and special paint schemes, but I will have to work harder, to get a good photograph of this one.    We had arrived into IAH with enough time to have a quick lunch at Pappadeaux, in the E Concourse. We had arrived at E-3, and were due to fly out of E-9, both right at the restaurant. Well, that was the original plan. We got a message, via the United App, that our gate had been changed - C-37! We finished our meal, and headed over to the C Concourse, which is attached to E, but it’s still a bit of a walk. We made it to C-37 in time, but not with a lot to spare. That is why I did not even look at our plane, outside the window - my mistake.    Though we are through IAH frequently, over the last few years, there has been a lot of construction on the United concourses. Just like at Chicago O’Hare, and Newark, they are adding “themed restaurants” along, or in the middle of the concourses - lot of new restaurants. Most have the ordering done on tablets, including payment. Most also now take United Mileage Plus FF points, as payment, making the whole thing cashless. Though the themes do differ, the menus (and especially the wine lists) have a standard feel to them. However, they are convenient.    We boarded on-time, and before Group 1, due to our status. That is when I saw the plaque, and kicked myself for not being at the gate early enough to get a photograph of this plane. I would try for one, when we arrived at New Orleans, MSY.    This A320, like all of United’s AirBus fleet now, had the newish FC seats, which are very nice, with a marble-topped podium, with marble drink drawer. They also have several pockets to hold items, but those must be stored elsewhere, for takeoff and landing. These seats recline a bit differently, in that the lower cushion slides forward, and the rear cushion to pivot, without intruding too much, into the space behind. The forward, and locked position has a bit too much recline built in, and I wish that they would go just a few degrees more forward. We like the First Class seats in the United Airbus ships a bit more, than those in the 737-800/900's. Now, the newer 737's do have slightly larger overhead bins, but those on the Airbus planes are larger, than on the older 737's. The general available room is similar (except for Row 1 seats at the bulkhead), with the A320 seats having a 20.5"" width and a 39"" pitch. First Class is 3 rows of 2-2,    This plane had the PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) which feeds content to one’s device, through the United App. The latest version must be present, or downloaded, before the doors are closed. One nice feature of the A320 is that the tray tables in FC, have a holder for a tablet/phone. However, I find that this could be more centered, as viewing is at a slight, but noticeable angle. On this short flight (320 miles), we did not use the PDE (free), or the WiFi (for a fee), so cannot comment on how well they worked.    We did not get the wine, or passed snacks on this short flight, as we had enjoyed a nice lunch, with better wines, at IAH.    We had pretty heavy clouds and haze, out of IAH, but did catch a glimpse of the Mississippi River, around Bayou Goula, LA, on our approach to MSY. The weather was OK, and we were soon below the upper clouds, by the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain, but did not get to see much, as we came directly in on Runway 19.    This was likely to be our last ever arrival at the old MSY terminal, as the new one is scheduled to be open, before our next trip to New Orleans. We will both miss the old terminal.    Our luggage was out downstairs, rather quickly, and we were off to the near-by Hertz counter, to pick up our rental car. With the construction of the Rental Center, one was just a short, covered walk from the old terminal. Now, it will be a shuttle bus ride, from the new terminal.    Our flight was good, and we arrived very close to on-time, even though the pilot had to deviate around a few thunder storms. The Gate Agents at IAH were very good (not always the case, after the Continental and United merger), and our Cabin Crew was excellent."
Jun 2020,10,The WORST,"I’d give negative stars if I could. Went to the airport the day of my scheduled flight (6/22), scanned my BOARDING PASS to get on the plane, and they told me I wasn’t confirmed for the flight. Talked to customer service, told me it was a Priceline issue (who I didn’t even buy the ticket through), then when I told them it was them, they told me there was nothing they could do, but gave me boarding passes for the next day (6/23). I was staying with family, and they had to drive BACK (over an hour) because they were nice enough to pick me up. Today (6/23), I went back with boarding passes that United Airlines gave me, scanned them, and they told me I wasn’t on the flight for today! I told them to give me a hotel, and it wasn’t until we called customer service on the phone when they offered me a flight for that night. They tried to tell me that I changed the flight myself, which never happened. The only accommodation I was given was meal vouchers, since I was going to be at the airport for 10 hours, and when I tried to use them, they were expired. Although they were printed 6/23 they expired 6/22. When I told the afternoon crew this, they just told me there’s nothing they can do, which is all anyone has been telling me. They will not accommodate or refund you in any way if things go wrong. It was all on their part, and all they’ve been saying is “there’s nothing we can do.” Don’t go through United. I don’t get home until tomorrow, now, when I was supposed to be home Monday."
Jun 2020,20,So Much For Not Filling the Middle Seat,"I guess the big deal United made about not assigning the middle seat was just hoax - or just not telling the whole story. Just got off a completely full flight from Chicago to Denver. From what I could see every seat on the 757 was filled, yet the flight attendants continuously told us that United cared about our health and safety. When we arrived in Denver the flight attendants scolded people who dared to stand until their row was called to deplane. This happened several times - the passengers weren’t trying to leave the plane, but simply stand up. It was very condescending and rude - and the deplaning by row to maintain social distancing was a joke after we’d been crammed together for the last two hours. And then the bags got ramped onto the wrong carousel and only after 45 minutes was there an announcement about the mistake. And this is why I try to always fly Delta."
Jun 2020,40,Oct - UA4342 Knoxville to Houston EMB-145 (#N15574) Seats 18C & D,"Oct - UA4342 Knoxville to Houston EMB-145 (#N15574) Seats 18C & D    On Wednesday, October 02,, we flew United Airlines UA4342, on an EMB-145 (#N15574) from Knoxville (TYS) to Houston (IAH), to connect with our flight home to PHX. This plane was operated by Expressjet Airlines, dba United Express, and it was the second time that we had flown this particular plane, and on the same route - back in May, but the flight number was UA4327 then. We had seats 18C & D, which are Exit Row seats. On the EMB-145, space is really at a premium, and the few extra inches of pitch, plus the necessary underseat storage, is always appreciated.    We had arrived at TYS Airport from Blackberry Farm, about 13 miles to the east, and in the mountains, so had a glass of wine at the Ruby Tuesday restaurant, in the main terminal building, waiting for our flight down to Houston, out of Gate 7. The first thing that I noticed was that the Smoky Mountain souvenir shop, Smoky Mountain Travel Mart was closed for renovation, though the one, before TSA Security was open. This had taken place, since July, when we were last at TYS. Then, the Starbucks was a construction site. Next, the attractive art exhibit, on the other side of the Security Area was gone - bare walls! TYS looked a bit different.    The plane arrived from IAH (it does a yo-yo between IAH and TYS several times per day), and we boarded only a few minutes late. It does not take long to turn-around an EMB-145.    We were in our seats, with my small briefcase store in the overhead bin (only on the starboard side of the aircraft), and my wife’s small, wheeled briefcase barely wedged below Row 17 seats.    Boarding before Group 1 has its advantages, and one needs any advantage on an EMB-145, as there are overhead bins only on the starboard side of the plane - no bins on the port side, at all, so everyone has to use those above the C & D seats. The EMB-145 is configured 1-2, for the entire cabin. The aisle is also about 2"" lower, than the level that the seats are on, so there is a “step-up.” To add to that, the overhead bins (and air duct on the port side) hang low, so one is very likely to bump their head, getting into, or out of the seat. At least the armrests on the aisle seats lift up. We fly EMB-145's too often, and I still hit my head, about every other flight.    Because of the small fuselage, the curvature cuts into legroom from the side, on the A and D seats. I still took the D seat, as I was hoping to get a few shots of the departure from TYS, but with the haze and clouds, that was almost a wasted effort. Two issues, however, are that the window has a largish “Exit Row Seats” sticker, and then one is over the wing, these being over-wing exits, so shooting from these seats will always be difficult. Unlike our ORD-TYS EMB-145, this one did not have the partial shade for the exit door window. It retracted fully.    The one bright spot on the EMB-145's, it is that on the starboard © & D) side, there are only two braces for the seats in front, so the width of the underseat storage is a bit wider, than on some larger planes. OK, that is the only bright side. Note that the distance from the floor, to the seat bottom in front of you, is much less, than on a larger plane. Also, the limited overhead bins are shallow, and their opening not very large - not much will fit. Note that unlike on many types of aircraft, the overhead bin doors drop down, and do not lift up. This can cause a bit of a log jam, in deplaning, as people try to lift the bin door up. My wife’s small, wheeled briefcase will not fit in the overhead bin, because it is about ½"" too thick, but will fit under the seat - but just barely. My small briefcase will fit in the overhead bins, with just barely enough room to fold my blazer, and place it atop the briefcase.    On this flight, there was one passing of the beverage cart, down the very narrow aisle. With our status, we got wine/alcohol at no charge, and we went with the Camelot California Chardonnay - OK, for being served in plastic cups, and not the worst wines we have had.    We had taken off into significant haze (not uncommon in the Smoky Mountains), and were in clouds for most of the flight down to Houston, but at least it was a smooth flight. Near IAH, the weather was changing, the clouds were heavy, just about until we broke through for final approach. We were going to be taking off in this weather, in just over an hour.    Our flight attendant was very good, and managed the cart, plus completed the beverage service, before landing - something that does not always happen on these short flights.    We arrived at Gate B-19, four minutes late, so hurried over to our departure gate, C-7, and a SkyTrain ride away.    In all, a good flight, on a plane that we dislike, but we were safely at IAH."
Jun 2020,40,Sept - UA656 Phoenix to Chicago 737-900ER (#3461) FC Seats 3A & B,"Sept - UA656 Phoenix to Chicago 737-900ER (#3461) FC Seats 3A & B    On Saturday, September 28, we flew United Airlines UA656 from PHX to ORD on a 737-900ER (#3461) in First Class, seats 3A & B. This was the first leg of a leisure trip to Blackberry Farm, in Walland, TN, so we were flying into Knoxville Airport (TYS), as our final destination. This was an earlier flight, than we normally take to Chicago, for my wife’s monthly meetings there, but we were connecting, to TYS, so were just up early.    We began our morning began at the United Club in T2 at PHX Airport. We flew out of Gate 6A, which was one of the old Continental gates, before the merger with United Airlines. As suspected, this ship was from the sCO side of the fleet, with DirectTV.    We taxied out from T2, and took off on Runway 7L, so were pointed toward Chicago from the start. We were only 5 minutes late for takeoff, due to ground traffic at PHX. Our plane had come in from Washington/Dulles (IAD), and had been waiting for departure.    We took off to light haze in the Phoenix Area, which increased a bit, not too long after leaving PHX. We also saw something interesting, in the High Desert, in Northern Arizona - a bank of clouds, reaching into the mountain valleys. We see such often, flying into LAX, or SFO, but seldom in the AZ Desert. At first, I thought that it might be smoke from a wild fire, but think it was just low clouds, and fog. I like the port side window seat on our morning flights out to Denver, and Chicago, as we often have the opportunity to see The Painted Desert, and often Meteor Crater. On this flight, it was both.    We boarded on-time, and as we board before the 1K and Group 1 passengers, were quickly into our seats, and ordered sparkling wine (Ca’ di Rajo Mitō), for the pre-departure beverage. We noted that the napkins were still promoting the new Spider Man movie, as was the Safety Film on our DirectTV. We will both be happy when that Safety Film has been replaced. Fortunately, we did not have the Spider-Man napkins, so maybe a step forward?    This was one of the newer 737-900's from the Continental side of the merged fleet, with the new “Dreamliner” ceiling and interior lighting, and it had DirectTV. The DirectTV is free, and convenient, but the equipment for it does take up some of the underseat storage space. On this flight, it worked well. There was also WiFi (for a fee), but neither of us used that.    The interior of the cabin had the newer, larger overhead bins, and my wife’s small, wheeled briefcase fit easily. My briefcase did fit below the seat, but it was a tight squeeze with the equipment boxes, but it did not have to be turned sideways.    The purser had our jackets hung in the closet, forward, and across from the galley. The seat width is very good, as is the legroom. The windows are fairly evenly aligned in Row 3, and better than in Row 1, where we recently had to fly, enroute to Chicago.    This 737-900 had 5 rows in First Class, in a 2-2 configuration. The FC seats are 21"" wide, with a 38"" pitch, which provides plenty of legroom, even with the DirectTV equipment. While the FC seats are fine, and fairly comfortable, we have grown fond of the FC seats in the Airbus A-319/320's, which were refurbished about 5 years ago, across the fleet.    Just before boarding, I noticed that there were only two seats available on this flight - one in FC, and the other in E+. When a few of the more elite fliers were moved about, upgrading them, only two, out of 11 folk on stand-by, made the flight. We have seen the earlier PHX-ORD flights full, but lately, there have been some empty seats on the later flights on that route.    As the haze and clouds thickened, and just before the meal service, the DirectTV reception developed a glitch - only Disney’s Aladdin was available. Well, I had seen that on a recent flight to London, and it was definitely not worth watching again. My wife’s DirectTV hung on something else, but not much more interesting. Even the Flight Map was out. Oh well, time to eat, as there was also not much to see outside the window.    This flight had a breakfast served in First Class, and we had our choices of:  Egg Souffle (rather than the recent Chibatta), or Oatmeal w/ fruit. We chose one of each, and neither was bad - not inspiring, but edible. Both came with the Chobani Yogurt (vanilla), and a small fruit bowl. We had passed bread, and I took the Cinnamon Bun, which is always tasty, but my wife declined, as they did not have Biscuits. My wife did add Decaf Coffee, and commented that since United went with Illy, a few years back, how much better this was, than their previous Decaf.    The still white wine was the M Napa Chardonnay, which has been common. It’s an OK Chard, so we were fine - eat and drink, the rest of the way to Chicago.    The clouds thickened, as we approached ORD, and we arrived to rain, and very low ceiling. As our approach was directly into ORD, there was not much to see, but the Illinois countryside - no flyovers of the Chicago skyline, and Lake Michigan, as we often get. In this weather, coming straight in, was fine with me. We arrived at gate C-24 (moved from C-26), and fortunately only 8 mins. late, as we had to get to gate B-18 for our flight to TYS. We had an hour now, so should be fine.    The flight attendants were great, as were the gate agents at PHX. Yes, the DirectTV did stop working (unless one just loved Aladdin), but otherwise the flight was nice. We left the plane, hoping that the rain would not affect our flight to Knoxville, as this was one of the first vacations we had taken, that did not involve a bunch of business meetings on both ends."
Jun 2020,40,Sept - UA3897 Chicago to Knoxville EMB-145 (#N11119) E+ Seats 18C & D,"Sept - UA3897 Chicago to Knoxville EMB-145 (#N11119) E+ Seats 18C & D    On Saturday, September 28, we flew United Airlines flight UA3897, from Chicago O’Hare (ORD), to Knoxville McGhee Tyson (TYS), on a EMB-145 (#N11119), operated by Tri-State Air, dba United Express, in E+, seats 18C & D - Exit Row seats. Originally, we were scheduled for a CRJ-200 (N17146), in seats 8C & D, operated by Air Wisconsin, dba United Express, but things changed. With the new ship, we were able to get moved to the Exit Row seats, on the EMB-145. Both the EMB-145 and the CRJ-200, are our least favorite planes in the United/United Express fleet. On our previous ORD-TYS flight, back in June, we flew an EMB-175, in First Class, and find that a much, much nicer aircraft - especially in FC.    We had landed at Gate C-24, a few minutes late, and had to make our way to Gate B-18 (moved from B-19), in an hour. The walk was easy, though I did not stop to photograph the lighting in the tunnel between the C and B Concourses this time. We arrived, with time to spare, so popped into the United Club in B, for a glass of wine. We then made our way to B-18, for boarding.    The weather had not improved, but it looked as though we would get out on-time, just into the rain and gloom.    We boarded on-time, and before Group 1 due to our status, and took our seats in the Exit Row. We like these, as on the EMB-145, they provide extra legroom. Boarding before Group 1 has advantages, and one needs those on an EMB-145, as there are overhead bins only on the starboard side of the plane - no bins on the port side, at all, so everyone has to use those above the C & D seats. Now, the EMB-145 is configured 1-2, for the entire cabin. The aisle is also about 2"" lower, than the level that the seats are on, so a “step-up.” Add in that the overhead bins (and air duct on the port side) hang low, one is very likely to bump their head, getting into, or out of the seat. We fly EMB-145's too often, and I still hit my head, about every other flight.    Because of the small fuselage, the curvature cuts into legroom from the side, on the A and D seats. In our case, my petite wife swapped with me, and took the window in 18D. With the lousy weather, and the fact that the wing obscures most of the view from Row 18, there was no reason to not trade places with her - no photography on this flight. Also, and I have encountered this on other UAX EMB-145's, the Exit Row window shade is only half length, and this one would not fit down into the slot, or go up, so was stuck in the middle of the window. No big deal, as there was nothing to see outside.    If there is a bright spot on the EMB-145's, it is that on the starboard (C & D) side, there are only two braces for the seats in front, so the width of the underseat storage is a bit wider, than on some larger planes. Now, that is the ONLY bright side. Note that the distance from the floor, to the seat bottom in front of you, is much less, than on a larger plane. Also, the limited overhead bins are shallow, and their opening not very large - not much will fit. Note also, that unlike on many types of aircraft, the overhead bin doors drop down, and do not lift up. This fools many, who are not used to these ships. My wife’s small, wheeled briefcase will not fit in the overhead bin, because it is about ½"" too thick, but will fit under the seat - but just barely. My small briefcase will fit in the overhead bins, with just barely enough room to fold my blazer, and place it atop the briefcase. The overhead bins are very tiny.    On this flight, there was one passing of the beverage cart, down the very narrow aisle. With our status, we would have gotten wine/alcohol at no charge, but declined, and especially as we were in the Exit Row. We did try a new snack, Pretzel Twist, but were not impressed.    The flight was fairly smooth, and we never did get much clear sky, and picked up more clouds, near TYS, but luckily no rain, as we still had a drive into the mountains.    We arrived about 15 mins. late, at Gate 7, but with no connecting flight, this was not an issue - our driver monitored the flight closely.    The gate crew at ORD was very good, and the flight attendant, was quite friendly. We were almost on-schedule, so other than the plane (the CRJ-200 would have been almost the same), we had a nice flight."
Jun 2020,40,Oct - UA2256 Houston to Phoenix 737-900 (#3403) FC Seats 2E & F,"Oct - UA2256 Houston to Phoenix 737-900 (#3403) FC Seats 2E & F    On Wednesday, October 02, we flew home to Phoenix (PHX) from Houston (IAH), where we had flown in from TYS, just over an hour before. We had arrived at Gate B-19, and were departing from Gate C-7 (changed from C-6). We had to hurry a bit, and take the SkyTrain, but made it to C-7, with a bit of time to spare, and even stopped by the new Bam Bam Vietnamese Beer Garden, for a glass of wine.    One thing, which I noticed, was that in the new work areas on the C Concourse, the AC/USB outlets, had a credit card swiping station, to get power. Most seats did have tablets, too, and not sure how those are charged - maybe the same device, as is on the outlets? Maybe those are for the tablet, and not the AC? We did not have time to fully investigate.    We boarded only a few minutes late, just before Group 1, and were seated, with our jackets hanging in the forward closet. We had our pre-departure sparkling wine, and settled back for the 2:48 hr flight home to Phoenix.    This 737-900, was from the Continental side of the fleet, and had an older cabin, and smaller overhead bins, but wife’s wheeled briefcase fit nicely. My briefcase fit under the seat in front, but had to be turned sideways, as the IFE (DirectTV) equipment took up quite a bit of that underseat storage.    On our flight out, earlier in the week, we were also on a 737-900, flying from PHX to ORD, before connecting to TYS. On that plane, the DirectTV malfunctioned, and one could only get one movie (oddly, it was Disney’s Aladdin for me, and a different movie for my wife, in the next seat). Well, the DirectTV on this plane, also malfunctioned, in that all one could get was the movie previews - over, and over, and over. We had taken off with broken clouds, but those thickened, so nothing to photograph. At least we had a “snack” coming, to break up the time, and they did have the M California Chardonnay, which is not bad. I think that the DirectTV equipment has reached it’s limits on age, as we are encountering more and more, that do not function.    Being under 3 hours (by just a bit), and in the afternoon, our snacks were a bit limited:  Southwest Chicken Salad, which was not bad, or the Cheese Plate, with cheeses, nuts and some dried fruit - sort of bleak, but OK.    After breaking out above the clouds over New Mexico, our flight was quite smooth, all of the way into PHX, though we did pick up some haze, starting about the AZ-NM line. Our approach was straight in on Runway 25R, along Tempe Town Lake. We arrived within 10 mins. of schedule, parked at Gate 5, and had our luggage out onto Carousel 4 rather quickly. I was surprised that we used Gate 5, in T2 at PHX, as for years, after the United/Continental merger, the sCO planes still used the old Continental gates at PHX, #6A & B, and 8. Historically, gates 3, 5 and 7 were for planes/routes from the United side of the merger. I guess that the merger is finally 100% complete.    The gate agents at IAH were fine, but one thing that was missing was a Global Services representative to get us between Concourse B and C, which we usually have, with a short connection. However, after we made the trek and were seated, a Global Services rep did board, to thank us for our loyalty. A nice gesture, but a ride to our departure gate would have been nicer.    The cabin crew was very good, and our service was excellent.    Except for the DirectTV not working, the flight was just fine, and we were heading home for a few days."
Jun 2020,10,From a direct fight to the longest possible trip,"F***ing childish. We bought our nonstop 4pm flight tickets when they were cheap due to COVID. Instead of a direct flight they put us on a flight from Denver at 8am to San Francisco then getting into Boston at 8pm. The flight back was also a direct 8am flight from Boston to Denver, it is now a 6am flight to Florida, 1 hour layover, flight to Nebraska then to Denver at 4:30pm. Absolutely ridiculous, as if the multi-million dollar bail out wasn’t enough now you have to bend your customers over that got a good deal on a flight."
Jun 2020,10,United has the worst customer service,Cancelled my flight 6 days prior to flying and refused to give me a full refund. I got back $161 of my $199 flight. Spent 3 hours on the phone and couldn’t get an explanation. Also forced me to check in my carry on backpack for weighing 28lbs....... Hopefully never flying with them again.
Jun 2020,10,Worst airline I’ve dealt with in my life,"I read United airline’s reviews and took a chance because I had no choice due to a family tragedy. However, it was the worst experience ever. My initial flight was delayed - which I’m okay with because it happens sometimes - but the delay made me miss my connecting flight. I was told to check with “Service” And they informed me that I could leave the next day. That just sounded crazy. Then they said that I could take an evening flight into a nearby airport. A half hour wait turned into 8 hours, no apology, no refund for my trouble. Goodness, I know things are kind of strange these days, but have some consideration of people’s time and grief. Worst airline ever. Stay away."
Jun 2020,50,Fantastic customer service,Our flight was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic last minute so we had to call customer service to sort it out. We finally got in touch with Mark at customer service who was AN ABSOLUTE HERO. He was able to work it out for us when we needed it most. Thank you Mark!!!!!!!!!!!
Jun 2020,10,"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST AIRLINE!!! AVOID THEM, AVOID THEM!!!!","DON'T EVER EVER EEEEVER USE THIS AIRLINE!!! If you want vacation and want to arrive on time and safe DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT USE united airlines!!! Simply DO NOT USE THEM!!! The worst airline I have ever dealt with. My biggest mistake was getting plane tickets with them first time after several years, i though something changed, oh well, the joke is on me, I felt for it... They are blood sucking vultures that DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR TRAVELERS... Wow, I though that this is American airline but dealing with them its like airline from a forth world country!!! Shame on them for screwing me good, and shame on me for felling again and going with them...    AGAIN, PLEASE, PLEASE if you want to enjoy your vacation, drive, even if its for 24 hours, its better than dealing with united airlines!!!!"
Jun 2020,50,"Great Service by Jen from Harpenden, near St Albans for those who don't know","This is actually a review of 2 flights, the one listed and UA 6333 from Houston to Austin.  The first flight was very organized, loading by row number, furthest first to reduce any congestion, everyone with masks and all precautions taken. Service was excellent and our stewardess Jen was extremely helpful and made the flight go quickly with her attendance and appreciation of customer needs. When arriving at Houston we unloaded from the front first to again avoid any congestion and everyone keeping their required distance.  The flight to Austin was different. Although Houston airport required masks there were plenty of people without and no one enforcing the wearing of them. The flight was good and quicker than expected but when we departed there was no such organization as before and people just crowded together to get off. I think this flight should have been better organized, similar to the previous one."
Jun 2020,10,Terrible!!!,Terrible overall!!! Flight delayed then cancelled... terrible communication and super unorganized! Never flying with them again
Jun 2020,40,Sept - UA523 Phoenix to Chicago 737-800W (#3230) FC Seats 3A & B,"Sept - UA523 Phoenix to Chicago 737-800W (#3230) FC Seats 3A & B    We flew United Airlines UA523 from PHX to ORD, on Sept, 17 on a 737-800W (#3230) in First Class, seats 3A & B. Originally, we were scheduled to fly another 737-800W (3246), but were changed to this plane late. This was a business trip to Chicago.    Our morning began at the little United Club in T2 at PHX Airport. We flew out of Gate 6B, which was one of the old Continental gates, before the merger with United Airlines. As suspected, this ship was from the sCO side of the fleet, with DirectTV.    We taxied out from T2, and took off on Runway 7L, so were pointed toward Chicago from the start. We were 17 minutes late for takeoff.    On takeoff, we caught a glimpse of an American Airline A-319, with the retro-Piedmont Airlines livery, and then had nice views of Papago Peak, and Park, on our climb out of The Valley, with a very light haze.    Sometimes, we take a bit of a northerly route, and skirt the Painted Desert, and Meteor Crater, and the A (window) seat gets a good view, but not so much on today’s flight. We vectored toward ORD pretty quickly, but did catch a bit of the colorful Painted Desert - just not as much, as on some other PHX-ORD flights, and less than on most PHX-DEN flights recently, but we did have good weather, with scattered clouds..    We had boarded on-time, and as we board before the 1K and Group 1 passengers, were quickly into our seats, and ordered sparkling wine (Ca’ di Rajo Mitō), for the pre-departure beverage. We noted that the napkins were still promoting the new Spider Man movie, as was the Safety Film on our DirectTV. I will be happy when that Safety Film has been replaced. It is the worst of the lot, and I would prefer to see the very first one brought back.    This was one of the older 737-800's from the Continental side of the merged fleet, with the older ceiling and interior lighting, and it had DirectTV. The DirectTV is free, and convenient, but the equipment for it does take up some of the underseat storage space. On this flight, it worked well. There was also WiFi (for a fee), but neither of us used that.    The interior of the cabin had the older, smaller overhead bins, but my wife’s small, wheeled briefcase fit easily. My briefcase did fit below the seat, but it was a tight squeeze with the equipment boxes, and had to be turned sideways..    Our jackets were hung in the closet, forward, and across from the galley. The seat width is very good, as is the legroom. The windows are fairly evenly aligned in Row 3, and better than in Row 1, where we recently had to fly, enroute to Chicago.    This 737-800 had 4 rows in First Class, in a 2-2 configuration. The FC seats are 21"" wide, with a 38"" pitch, which provides plenty of legroom, even with the DirectTV equipment. While he FC seats are fine, and fairly comfortable, we have grown fond of the FC seats in the Airbus A-319/320's, which were refurbished about 5 years ago, across the fleet. We also like the cabins in the newer 737-800/900 ships, with the larger overhead bins, and “Dreamliner” ceilings and lighting - but the seats are the same, as on this plane.    As this was the “lunchtime flight,” we had:  Sweet Thai-style Beef Salad, and Thai-style Chicken (listed as Buffalo Chicken, but that was not what was loaded). Both dishes were OK, but I am getting tired of Thai-style anything on United. That concept has run its course for us, and time to make changes. We find almost all variations too sweet, as well. For dessert, we had the Strawberry Cheesecake, which while not our favorite, it is not bad.    We had the M California Chardonnay ‘17 and the Tall Sage Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ‘16. Both are pretty good wines, and did pair well with both of the Thai-style dishes.    In the middle of the flight, we picked up more clouds, and more haze, but as our approach into ORD was straight from the Southwest, with no loop over the Lake, and Downtown Chicago, there was not much to see, beyond a few golf courses, a couple of suburban neighborhoods, some low-rise office parks, and warehouses.    The flight was slightly bumpy, out of PHX, but that is to be expected, and we did hit a few bumps, mid-flight, but nothing to even stop the cabin service.    We arrived pretty much on-time at ORD, and pulled into Gate B9 (moved from Gate B2). We had our baggage quickly, and were soon headed into downtown Chicago, for my wife’s first meeting.    The flight was very good, and both the Gate Agents at PHX, and the Cabin Crew were excellent - and the DirectTV worked well the entire flight, which has not always been the case on some recent flights on the sCO 737's."
Jun 2020,40,Sept - UA373 Chicago to Phoenix Airbus A319 (#4028) FC Seats 2E & F,"Sept - UA373 Chicago to Phoenix Airbus A319 (#4028) FC Seats 2E & F    After a short business trip, on September, 19, we were back to Chicago O’Hare Airport (ORD), to fly home to Phoenix (PHX). The weather was quite cloudy, and rather gloomy, but our flight was listed “On-time.”    We stopped by the United Club in T1, near Gate B-18, as we were flying out of Gate B-4. We only had a couple of glasses of Champagne, and especially as this was a “dinner flight.”    We flew UA373 from ORD to PHX on an Airbus A319 (#4028) in First Class, Seats 2E & F. We boarded on-time at 12:45pm, and were in our seats, with a glass each of sparkling wine, as our pre-departure beverage. Our plane had just come in from Baltimore (BWI), and had arrived 7 minutes early. This time, our departure gate did not change - something that has been happening to us a lot on the ORD-PHX flights, but our plane did change during the day, from A319 #4046.    One thing that I noticed for the first time, is that the “B” in the gates on this concourse, are the Chicago Bear’s font, and the gate signs have the Chicago Bears’ colors - nice tribute.    We boarded only a few minutes late, and were in our seats with a glass of Prosecco, our jackets hanging behind Row 3, before the plane was half full. As has been typical for most of our most recent flights on UA, and especially out of ORD, this one was completely full, with nine people on the wait list. Also, with only 12 FC seats, no one made the upgrade list at the airport.    The overhead bins on the A319/320 planes are adequate - slightly larger than on UA’s older 737's, but not as large as on the newer ones, with the “Dreamliner” ceiling and lighting - those are very large for a narrow-body aircraft. Still, my wife’s small, wheeled briefcase fit easily, and my briefcase fit below the seat in front of me.    This A319, like all of United’s AirBus fleet, had the newish FC seats, which are very nice, with a marble-topped podium, with marble drink drawer. They also have copious pockets to hold items, but those must be stored elsewhere, for takeoff and landing. These seats recline a bit differently, in that the lower cushion slides forward, and the rear cushion to pivot, without intruding too much, into the space behind. The forward, and locked position has a bit too much recline built in, and I wish that they would go just a few degrees more forward. The window alignment, to the seat is better in Row 2, than in Row 1, where one has to lean forward a bit, to have a good view. With the weather and clouds, I was not expecting a view, at all.    This plane had the PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) which feeds content to one’s device, through the United App. The latest version must be present, or downloaded, before the doors are closed. The streaming PDE worked fine. This service is free. There was also WiFi available, for a fee, but neither of us used that. One nice feature of the A319 is that the tray tables in FC, have a holder for a tablet/phone. However, I find that this could be more centered, as viewing is at a slight, but noticeable angle. Still, it works pretty well.    Our dinner was Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese (was scheduled for our inbound flight, but was substituted for a Thai-style Chicken). This is a tasty dish, which we have had a few times before. I forget what the other option was (Thai-style something, and we are very tired of all of those variations), but we both ordered this. That is unusual, as we normally always do one each, but not this time. It came with a mixed salad, and then the Carrot Cheesecake, which we find the best of the United cheesecake variations. One note, and not for the first time either, we did not get the warmed mixed nuts, prior to the meal service - that seems to happen quite a bit on ORD-PHX flights nowadays.    There were two Chardonnays, the M, which is now quite standard, but then a bottle of a new one to us, Tunnel of Elms by Beringer, a CA Chard, and one, which looked like a Bulldog had chewed on the label. Both were pretty good, with the M taking the prize. I guess that they have a different wine out of BWI, as we have seen nearly everything that UA’s Sommelier, Doug Frost, has to offer.    Approaching the Rockies, we started to see breaks in the clouds, with clearing toward Phoenix. Often, we get nice views of the Painted Desert, but not as much this time, but what we did see, was very nice in the afternoon light. Our approach was direct, and we landed on Runway 26, which meant a very long taxi around to T3. We arrived at PHX to a lovely early Autumn afternoon, and only 17 mins late (part of that was the taxi time). Our luggage was on Carousel 4 fairly quickly, and we were headed home to wash clothes and re-pack, prior to heading back out, in a few days.    The Gate Agents at ORD were great (not always the case), and our Cabin Crew was excellent. The flight, while into the gloom out of ORD, was smooth, and with the clearing weather, quite nice."
Jun 2020,10,I can't believe this company is still in business!,"Trip from Texas to Hawaii for 9 of us was cancelled due to CV-19. Have been trying to get our Electronic Travel Certificates since 4/17/20 (today is 6/13/20). Have had to call United TWELVE (yes 12) times counting today: eventually I received received 2 of the 9 certs, then another 2 weeks later, then, when I called several times, after waiting the 24 business days they said it could take, I figured out they had typo in the email address for last 5 certs. Many hours of calling to United. Finally, on 6/12, Jackie helped to correct email address. Within 30 minutes we had 5 emails with 4 of them including the ETC attachment. Whoever sent the 5 emails, forgot to attach the Electronic Travel Certificate to that email. Trying to correct this mistake on their part took me several more hours & 4 more calls to United - each time having to start over, give Case #s over & over to 4 different people. Twice got cut off while on hold for over 30 minutes each time. Even the final time, when I asked what email they were going to try to send the ETC to, it was still the email address with the typo (even though they had successfully sent 4 to the corrected email address). This was one of the most exhausting, disappointing, frustrating customer service experiences that I have had in my life."
Jun 2020,50,Awesome in Dealing with Covid related cancellation,"This review on;y covers dealing with their reservation folks on the phone. I had called to work out how to deal with a flight cancellation, after receiving an email from them. There was no wait to talk to a liver person. We had some phone connection problems and the representative called me back twice trying to get a better connection and ultimately a supervisor called me back on our landline. Both representatives were very kind, thorough and helpful. They promptly provided a refund back to my credit card."
Jun 2020,10,Terrible experience and I haven't even had my flight yet,"The poor quality of this company is obvious just from the booking experience alone. It was incredibly complicated just to book a flight. They intentionally make checking a bag a totally separate process from booking the flight (seriously, you get a confirmation email with your flight booking and then have to go separately check a bag, which is totally counter-intuitive). I'm guessing they do this to increase the odds people will forget and have to pay insanely high baggage fees at the airport, which is a pretty dishonest tactic. Now, I just found out there is no option to use an electronic version of my boarding pass--it must be printed. I'd avoid this company and choose a more reputable one."
Jun 2020,10,Canceled my flight without my consent,"United canceled my connect flight without my consent and they blamed me for canceling part of my trip from Acapulco to Mexico city. The destination were Acapulco to Mexico city to Houston to Charleston, Sc.They made me pay additional $400+ to get a new ticket to fly from Acapulco to Mexico City. They also made me stay at Mexico City layover 10 hour+. Thats unacceptable Stay away from this corrupted airline."
Jun 2020,10,Misled and then extorted.,"Ref PNR HVNZPQ, on Tuesday, 09 June I was traveling ROC-ORD-DFW. Just prior to boarding ORD-DFW I was told by the company I was visiting that the meeting I was flying to was cancelled. I asked the gate attendant if it's possible to put a stop to my baggage and reroute me on an evening flight ORD - BOI, instead. She called ticketing and told me the price supplement would be in the neighborhood of $210, and asked that I please wait until after boarding to redirect me. I agreed, not wanting to hold up the boarding process, and confirmed my intent not to proceed with the flight to DFW. She did inform me to put a hold on my baggage and it wouldn't be loaded on the aircraft.    After boarding was completed, I returned to the attendant, who again called her colleague, and was informed the supplement for the ORD-BOI would be in excess of $1,100! I was shocked, and questioned how this could happen. She said her colleague failed to see that the layover time would be in excess of 4 hours, that the Z class I was traveling was no longer available, etc...    I tried to appeal to her, saying that my decision to proceed with the rerouting was guided by her price indication. Otherwise, I would have flown ORD-DFW and grabbed the later direct flight DFW-BOI on AA. There was no appealing, no acceptance of providing misleading and inaccurate information to me. I even got my company's travel agent in Denmark, who explained to the United rep how it would be possible for me to be routed to BOI on Z class. The two of them debated for at least 20 minutes, with the United agent talking down my agent, refusing to listen.    In the end, I decided it would be less expensive for me to spend the night in Chicago and fly the next day ORD-SFO-BOI for a supplement of ""only $480.91.    Oh, and my luggage was sent to DFW after all. By stroke of luck (the only one in this fiasco), United were able to return it to me later in the day, which required a round trip on hotel shuttle bus to pick up (another hour robbed from me).    I feel extorted and taken advantage of. Based on what my travel agent said, the United ticketing agent could absolutely have rerouted me for the intial quoted supplement. The disruption and additional expense incurred makes me inclined to do everything possible to avoid supporting United and to disinvest in my UAL holdings. Thank God my Gold Membership is with SAS. This was simply a horrible experience. Let's see if any of what I shared hits sympathetic eyes that might just result in an apology."
Jun 2020,10,Buyer Beware- Airlines out for survival and not customer,Airlines are out to survive so don't expect any customer service.  Here are the things that are doing.  Websites so difficult to understand or not user friendly  Will deny any service when tickets are bought through a third party.  Go on Orbit and Kyak and low priced tickets operate through another party.  Buyer Beware.  They should be regulated again.
Jun 2020,50,Honored My Refund Request,"Canceled our March 25, 2020 flight from L.A. to Hawaii, on March 15, due to Covid19 concerns. (Hawaii went on lock-down on about March 26.) Waited until April 30, then called the 800-864-8331 refunds number. Had non refundable tickets. (The flight time had been changed then canceled.) Got Desiree, who said no refund, only voucher. Cited Dept. of Transportation mandate and asked for supervisor. Got Kay. I mentioned that we had another reservation for Oct. 2020 and would have no opportunity to use vouchers. She said that might be a recognized exception and she put in a request for refund. Only one week later than the 5-week estimate, I got an email saying that the refund was approved. Four days after that, I got my $925.60 refund. This has greatly increased my loyalty to United.  6/9/2020"
Jun 2020,10,All About Money,"When I purchased my tickets I paid for Insurance through United as I always do with any Airline as well as paying for a assigned seat. I flew up for a business meeting workshop. While in town I was informed by my potential employer that I was to attend one more final workshop the following week. Good it happened because my Uncle passed away and I was able to attend the funeral as well (this was late February before all the shutdowns for COVID).    The flight from FL to VA (US6266) bathroom was non-working for the flight over. It was a morning flight so I had already drank my coffee. It was so uncomfortable and when we landed I had to literally run off the plane (when we were given the okay) to the nearest bathroom.    When I called to delay my flight I was informed I must pay $200.00 plus another $27.00 for my seat. I was told I would have to go through their Travel Guard company to get my money back.    I have been fighting this since I flew back to Florida in early March 2020.    I had not flown with United for a long time and decided since they flew non-stop to Dulles, I would give them a try again. I never go through this nightmare with other airlines that I fly with and I always get insurance...just in case.    I am fairly sure the people that need to read these reviews do not but a Big Shout Out to you United....Shame on you! So disrespectful to your customer."

Jun 2020,40,Sept - UA5534 Phoenix to Los Angeles ERJ-175 (#N109SY) FC Seats 2C & D,"Sept - UA5534 Phoenix to Los Angeles ERJ-175 (#N109SY) FC Seats 2C & D    On Monday, September 02, we flew United Airlines UA5534, from Phoenix (PHX) to Los Angeles (LAX), as the first leg of a leisure trip to London (LHR), in First Class, Seats 2C & D on an EMB-175 (#N109SY), operated by SkyWest Airlines, dba United Express. We fly PHX-LAX quite a bit, but always on their earlier flight. As we were connecting to the overnight flight to London (LHR), this one gave us a comfortable connection of right at 4 hrs at LAX, and besides, we wanted to try the newly opened Polaris Lounge at LAX.    We started the morning at the little United Club at PHX, with a glass of Champagne, and then walked down to Gate 7 in T2, which is basically across from the UA Club. The Club was fairly full, so we sat in the back, by the little business center, but that allowed us to charge a few devices. As the PHX UA Club is small and older (soon to be replaced, when United moves to the refurbished T3), AC outlets can be at a premium. I hope that the new Club in T3 has many, many more, like most newer UA Clubs do.    We boarded on-time, and had taken our seats, before Group 1 was called. On the UA EMB-175's, there are 4 rows of seats, in a 1-2 configuration, in First Class. These are designated A and then C & D, with no B seats. The overhead bins above the A seats is very small, but long ago, I realized that my small briefcase fit perfectly there - though not much else, besides a medium-sized purse will. My wife’s small wheeled-briefcase does fit nicely in the bins, above the our C-D seats (starboard side of the plane), and there is a convenient closet by the galley in FC, where our jackets were hung. My briefcase also fits easily under the seat in front, as there are no IFE mechanics taking up space there, on the EMB-175.    We fly a lot of UAExpress planes, and really like the little EMB-175, from when they first introduced it. Unfortunately, we still have to fly many (too many) CRJ-400/700, and EMB-145 ships. I try my best not to, but often have no choice. Once, the UAX CRJ-700 had a closet, but that was removed for one more row of seats in Economy.    Our seats are quite comfortable, with good pitch, and good width, plus comfortable lower cushions, at 37"" pitch and 20"" width.. The width is slightly reduced, as the tray tables are in the fixed armrests.    In the podium, between the C & D seats, we had two AC/USB outlets, and power to charge one of my camera batteries on this flight..    On this short flight, we only did a glass of the Camelot, CA Chardonnay, which is not our favorite, but UAX has had it as their white wine for years now. We did encounter a new item on the passed snack basket - Pretzel Twists. Like the Camelot, not a favorite..    One nice thing was that the passenger in 2A had a cute little French Bulldog puppy, and when he was taken out for a breather, we got to see him. Until he came out of his puppy bag, I had no idea that he was flying with us - if only some adults could behave that well.    Our ship was clean, but I did notice that one of the interior wall panels was pulling loose, with insulation showing - time for Maintenance to have a look at that.    Our Flight Attendant was very good, and quite friendly, and at least we did not have to sit through the United/Spider-Man safety film - enough with that, please..    This plane did have PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), providing streaming content to one’s personal device, and this service is free. Because of the short duration, neither of us used it. I did not even notice if it had WiFi, which is always for a fee, or not, but assume that it did, as I believe that all UAX EMB-175's, are so equipped.    We took off into bright skies, with broken clouds out of PHX on Runway 25R, but quickly were into some haze. We then encountered clouds to about Hemet, CA, and when we broke through that layer, had heavy haze, but even that cleared on our final approach. The flight was smooth, and uneventful, beyond just great service, and we landed a few moments early at LAX. We parked at Gate 84, so had the short walk over to T7, and our departure gate, 76A. We had time to visit that new Polaris Club - plenty of time."
Jun 2020,10,Disrespectful company United Airlines,"I received an emai this morning from the company explaining to me that my flight was very full, if I could reschedule or ask for a Voucher in the amount of the ticket. I contacted the company twice and the attendants told me that I could not have the voucher and for me to re schedule I would have to pay an absurd difference in the value of the ticket. In other words, they sent me an email to make the exchange, I accepted and lost the amount I had already paid. This is absurd with us consumers. Knowing if we are in a Pandemic, (COVID-19) and they are not thinking about the consumer. Regrettable this Company. I am totally dissatisfied with the service offered."
Jun 2020,40,Sept - UA923 Los Angeles to London 787-9 (#3958) Polaris Seats 1D & E,"Sept - UA923 Los Angeles to London 787-9 (#3958) Polaris Seats 1D & E    On September 02, we flew United Airlines UA923 from Los Angles (LAX), to London Heathrow (LHR). This was on a 787-9 (#3958), in Polaris Business Seats 1D & E. This was an earlier 787-9, and had not been retro-fitted with the full Polaris layout. Going back a bit, United basically did away with Business and First Class, and combined those into Polaris, but there are still two different Polaris configurations. This one, the older version, was called “Polaris Business,” but I call it “Polaris Light.” It has the full Polaris soft product, but still basically a business class seat/pod, which is a holdover from the old Business Class The configuration in Polaris Business on this 787-9 was 2-2-2, and all forward facing. We had the interior 2 seats, side-by-side, at the bulkhead, and because of a cabinet in front of us, the center seats are slightly offset from the outboard rows, by about ½ a pod. I will go into more detail on the configuration, and amenities, later on.    We arrived at LAX from PHX, with a 4 hr layover, so spent time in the newly-opened United Polaris Club in T7, near our departure gate 76A. This was the smallest Polaris Lounge, that we have been too, but found it quite nice, and “intimate” probably best describes it. Besides a nice bar, with a good wine selection, it offers sit-down dining from the menu, or an extensive buffet. Note: one can only order from the menu, in the small dining room, but are free to use the buffet, regardless of where they are seated in the Lounge. We did a bit of both, and found the selections very good, plus we kept the bartender busy, by trying a bit of every wine on the list. This Lounge is located where the old United International First Club was (converted to a regular UA Club, until the new UA Club could be finished), so sits atop the “hub” in T7. One must just look for the elevator.    Our scheduled boarding time was 5:45pm. If possible, we like to do our PHX-LHR connection at SFO, and especially as that flight gets into London a bit later, so that our hotel room is always available. The LAX-LHR flight gets in at 12:20pm (London Time), so we always have to wait a few hours in the bar.    We boarded in the very first group, and were settled into our Polaris “pods” quickly – just in time for the pre-departure Nicolas Feuillatte Brut Reserve NV Champagne, which still seems to be Sommelier Doug Frost’s Polaris Champagne. Our bags were stowed above the seats, in the large overhead bins, which were not filled on this flight. Our jackets were stored in the closet, and we were ready for our 10:35 hr flight to LHR.    Seats/Pods:  First, the seats fully recline into a 100% lay-flat bed, just like the two pods in the classes that Polaris “combined/replaced.” The “bed” was comfortable, though its width was closer (or seemed to be) to that from the old Business FC units, and not the more spacious old Global FC pods, or as spacious as the FULL Polaris pods, which are nicer, but still short of the Global FC pods. The recline controls are on the podium, and worked well. Here are my observations on Polaris-Light vs Full Polaris, with some Global First Class comments, thrown in:  Full aisle access – Great improvement    Slightly claustrophobic – More like the old Business FC, and remember that there are subtle changes, in alternating rows. Arm rests do drop down, but that extra width exposes one to folk passing by in the aisle, just a bit.    Lighting changes – overhead light is good, but in seat 1E, a bit misplaced, and not as useful for filling in paperwork. It could also have a broader beam, as it is concentrated at the back of the tray table, when extended.    Tray table – Combo of slide out (on an arced track) and fold-out. OK, but a tad cumbersome.  Coat hanging clip in pod – convenient for landing. During takeoff and flight, the flight attendants store coats in closet.    Seat/bed comfort – about the same, as with the old Global Business Class units, and I recommend asking for the “mattress pad,” for a bit more cushion.  Armrests – one side (aisle side in 1D & E) did retract, for more width, but not as much, as the old Global FC pods.    Walls – higher, for more privacy – as observed in my previous reviews of United Polaris, the partitions between the middle pods on the 787 differ per alternating rows, and then between pods at the bulkheads. On this 787, Row 1 is at the bulkhead, and our partition was small. Unlike the full Polaris hard product, these do not retract.    Bedding – Polaris full Saks 5th Ave soft-product – great, and an extra contour-pillow, and mattress cover, available upon request.    Storage – Storage bins have decreased in number and definitely size, from Global FC. There are fewer places to store anything, than even in Business FC, and far fewer (number and size), than in Global FC. One gets one extra shelf, above the footwell, but that is completely inaccessible, when the seat/bed is reclined. There was an odd little shelf, immediately below the monitor, which was quite deep, but not very tall. Maybe for a laptop, as there was a USB input port on the monitor? There is also a shelf at the front of the pod, and atop the monitor, but this area at Row 1 Center, is often used by the crew, and especially for pre-departure and meal service - pretty much unusable by the passenger.    General seat comfort – OK, but many of the intermediate positions are not really comfortable. In these new pods, everything sort of works together, and it is difficult, to impossible, to adjust just one aspect, say the seatback only – cannot be done.    A/VOD – Full Polaris has large, high-def, flat-screen monitors, which are an improvement over the screens from Business FC, and even Global FC. The monitors in Polaris-light are medium-rez, so an improvement, but in Full Polaris, they are better. Controls are tethered, like before, but seemed a bit “fiddley.” Programming was extensive, but the categorization a bit “odd” in places. Though I have been using similar A/VOD systems on UA flights, I had to experiment a bit more, and it seemed that choices were harder to make, but the monitors are also “touch-screen.” The A/VOD monitor is a bit far forward, to allow for touch-screen, unless the seat is fully upright, and even then, one probably has to take off their seatbelt.    “Charging ports – Nice array of AC, USB and other connections, conveniently located in pod wall, over a small shelf. AC is USA 120V standard. Earphone plug is 1-2 prong, and is located, so that cable does dangle over one’s shoulder. My 1-prong Bose QC15 worked fine, and the 2-prong UA Bose headset (power from the second prong) was good. There is no compartment in Polaris-light, so the UA supplied Bose earphones reside in a little recession in the storage area, behind the seat. On this flight I tried those, but like my QC15's better.    Amenity kit – sort of a scaled back version of the older Business FC kits. Nothing special, and a far cry from the kits once offered in Global FC. Still, OK kits. They also featured a full array of the new Sunday Riley products, replacing the Cow Shed line, but no pen, and no comb, which had been included for years.    The overhead bins were quite spacious, and our two briefcases, a small backpack, my wife’s purse and my hat, all fit easily. There was even room to store the bed linens, until needed. Our jackets were hung in the closet.    Once airborne, we had warmed, scented towels, followed by the normal United Warm Mixed Nuts. We moved to the still white wine, which was the Talbot Kali Hart Estate Grown Chardonnay ‘17, which was a nice wine, and especially at 30,000 feet..    We started dinner with:  Chilled Appetizer of Thai-styled lemon grass shrimp w/ mango slaw - this was a nice starter, and the shrimp were very tasty. The mango slaw was a touch flat, and probably needed one more component to set it off..  Salad of Napa and red cabbage, carrot and mango, served with dressing, and assorted breads - pretty good salad, so we were on a roll here..  My Main Course was: Seared Cape Hake Fish Fillet w/ beurre blanc, lemon risotto, baby bok choy, green beans plus bell peppers and onions - the fish was very good, and the beurre blanc did a nice job with both it, and the risotto, though it did not make the dish look like a 3-star presentation - still, tasted good, and the peppers and onion went to the side.  My wife had the Seared Beef Short Ribs w/ morel sauce, stone-ground grits, green beans, roasted carrots and parsnips - on United we have had a love/hate relationship with the Beef Short Ribs. Some have been horrible, while some have been quite good, both flavorful and well prepared. This was in the latter category, and quite nice - still, a 50-50 chance of getting the good versions.    During the flight, and starting with my meal I explored the red wine selection (no other still whites on board this flight), with the Château Greysac Bordeaux blend, Gravières du Roy ‘12, Samur-Champigny ‘16 and Benzinger Sonoma County Merlot ‘14. All were good, and the Merlot went well with the Beef Short Rib.    The other Main Course options were:  Spicy Thai-style Chicken w/ coconut ginger broth and udon noodles - we get a version of this dish on United’s domestic routes, and have grown very, very tired of it - besides the sauce is almost always too sweet.  Ricotta Salata and Wild Honey Manicotti w/ brown butter cauliflower, rainbow carrots, vegetable caponata with tomato and cranberries - this dish tempted us both. While our choices turned out quite good, I would liked to have tasted this one - but we still have 2 more trips to LHR this year, so maybe?  I opted for the International Cheese Assortment, and a glass of the Churchill LBV Port ‘14, while my wife went for the “Signature Sundae,” which is something that she started only about a year ago, on the UA long-haul flights. She also had a small cake, but I did not hear what it was.    There was a pre-arrival meal of:  Caprese Omelet w/ Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese and roasted tomatoes  Or Seasonal Fruit w/ cereal and milk  We declined on both, and only had coffee, especially as we had lunch planned already in London, plus a rather early dinner.    Early on, in the introduction of Polaris, United had a “wine tasting,” with a four wine pour, on a metal arch. Those were fun, but were fairly recently discontinued – the stemless wine glasses in the arch were not really stable, and then all the glasses had to be cleaned. In my case, I always do an impromptu wine tasting, so lots of glasses have to be cleaned anyway.    We only had a few bumps out of LAX, but it did get a bit rough, over Ireland, and into LHR.    Our cabin crew was fun and efficient, and our flight to LHR was a very nice one. We arrived a bit early, and made the approach into LHR directly – no circling the City on this flight. We were through UK Immigration, and Customs with the new Passport kiosks, and off to our hotel, The JW Marriott Mayfair, within about an hour and a half.    A very good flight, though we both miss flying SFO-LHR on UA930, but at least got to experience the new Polaris Lounge at LAX."
Jun 2020,40,Sept - UA2249 Denver to Phoenix 737-900 (#3435) FC Seats 2A & B,"Sept - UA2249 Denver to Phoenix 737-900 (#3435) FC Seats 2A & B    On Monday, Sept 09, we flew UA2249 on a 737-900 (#3435) in First Class, Seats 2A & B, Denver (DEN) to Phoenix (PHX), as our last leg of a trip to London, PHX-LAX-LHR-DEN-PHX.    We had arrived almost an hour late into DEN, at Gate B-33, but only had to get to B-27, for this flight. We did not tarry, but did not need any assistance from Global Services, to get to the gate in time to board.    We were boarded on-time, and just before Group 1, and in our seats quickly, with my wife’s wheeled briefcase stored above us, and my small briefcase wedged under the seat in front of me. I say “wedged,” because this ship was from the Continental side of the fleet, with DirectTV, and that equipment takes up quite a bit of real estate. It does not really affect leg/foot room, but does offer little room for normal carry-ons. Fortunately, my wife only had her purse, so my hat also fit. Our jackets were hung up in the forward closet, and we settled back, declining the pre-departure beverage, but did opt for the Chardonnay, mid-flight. We declined the passed snacks. One thing, which I did notice was that the napkins used, were NOT the Spider-Man tie-in napkins, of which I have become very tired - but then we did have to sit through the Spider-Man safety video on the DirectTV. I suppose I cannot have everything.    There was still a lot of runway work being done at DEN, but then we had flown in and out, fairly recently. We took off with haze and clouds, so missed any views of the Front Range completely, and only caught glimpses of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Great Sand Dunes National Park, and the Painted Desert (the month before, on the same flight, we were treated to some nicer afternoon views), and encountered heavy clouds, into Phoenix, so nothing to see. Not the prettiest of views, which can be spectacular and especially with an afternoon flight. The atmospherics were a good reason, that I enjoyed the DirectTV - nothing else to see. On our flights between Denver and Phoenix, I seldom watch the DirectTV, or the streaming media on the PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) on the non-Continental ships.    We had bumps out of DEN, but that is expected in the Autumn, and then bumps into PHX – which is also very common. If Denver, or Phoenix were smooth, I would assume that I was on the wrong flight!    This 737-900 had DirectTV, which functioned fine, and as the clouds increased, I watched a little football (my Saints!). It also had WiFi, for a fee, but neither of us used that. This ship also had the old-style ceiling/lighting, and the smaller overhead bins, but everything that we needed stored, fit fine. The seats were comfortable, and even with my briefcase crammed under the seat in front of me, I had adequate leg/foot room.    Our cabin crew was great, as had been the gate agent at DEN (not always the case there, for some odd reason?). We were on-time arriving back home, and other than the clouds during the flight, all was very good. Our luggage was out onto Carousel 4 fairly quickly, and we were headed home, to do a washing, before our next flight - before we were to return to London, in October."
Jun 2020,10,Flight Cancellation - Covid -19 and rebook,"My parents have been stuck in another country since this epidemic began. United cancelled the flight (I understand it was because of the virus), but then when we tried to re-book at the same rate they wanted to charge us an addition $250 per person. We spoke to a supervisor and we were able to convince them it was not our fault and we should not be charged the difference in price. United finally accepted and booked the flight back. A couple days later we received an email cancellation and when we called United, they told us that the travel agency request a refund. Out flight that was booked and confirmed was cancelled because the travel agency requested a refund. You got to be kidding with me right. Now, in order for us to have our parents come back we would have to buy new tickets at the new rate which (get ready) is $1,700 dollars. The origin tickets were $150 dollars.  Bottom line United wanted to charge us the current rate instead of honoring the original rate. I will never fly United again."
May 2020,10,Ruined the trip,"Horrible. Made us ""sleep"" on the floor because they realized once we got ON THE PLANE, their wasn't enough ""people"" so they made us GET OFF THE PLANE. We had to wait 12 hours to fly w the next morning flight the following day. They didn't care at all. I will never ever ride united again, and I literally tell everyone I know not to use this disgusting airline. I hope they go bankrupt, seriously. They deserve it."
May 2020,30,Review of United Airlines,"United airlines has a nice plane, in terms of comfort, but they have no amenities included. I travel internationally to Brazil frequently and delta wins. Free alcohol, nice meals, comfortable. American is next, also free alcohol but the meals aren’t as good. United won’t be my carrier again!"
May 2020,10,No refund for cancelled flights that left us stranded.,"We booked flights from PV to San Francisco in March and then on to Vancouver, B.C.  The flights were cancelled by United almost immediately after we booked them.  We had to scramble to find other flights to get home. After two months of trying to  get a refund from United and receiving their generic replies it is clear they have no  intention of refunding us. I will never fly with them again ! This is just out and out theft."
May 2020,10,united ripoff!!,They refused to refund my money after they changed my flight by almost six hours and adding an additional layover! I would understand their position if I just wanted my money back for no reason. This has to be the worst airline ever! Hopefully they go out of business and another airline fills the void. Before booking United; I would rather take my chances hitch hiking!!!
May 2020,10,Canceling the flight but no refund do to COVID-19,"United Airlines send an email that they canceled the international flight due to the COVID 19 and that makes sense, but they said do not call or email if you are entitled to refund we will let you know. We need the money back since we can book another flight with someone else. Very unprofessional, if you can't provide the service, refund our money!!!! In the questionnaire was when did you travel no option to respond that we have not"
May 2020,20,delayed as usual,They are always delayed or there’s a problem with something.flying during a pandemic there are no flights at all at the airport and they still delayed somehow.
May 2020,10,Worst airline ever,"That they cant refund my &380 at this time is the worst thing ever, i cancelled my flight after booking due to unavoidable circumstances, I filled refund form, I followed with the airline for over 1 month, they kept telling me its being processed, then the last thing they told me was that the ticket was non refundable."
May 2020,50,They Did Very Well Considering the Circumstances,"I flew from Omaha to Denver and then to LAX on May 15, 2020, and in reverse to the same cities on May 18, 2020. They were trying to social distance. They were insuring people were wearing masks when they were not eating or drinking. The flight attendants were amazing considering they are putting themselves on the front lines of the virus to ensure people can continue to travel in this industry. And, May 18th was my birthday, and they made me feel special with the limitations put on them. One flight attendant gave me extra snacks and Purell wipes, and Mr. Howe from Denver gave me a glass of wine. I was very pleased, and kept in mind they are under the scrutiny of the public AND the economy. Thank you United for making my travels pleasurable at a rough time!"
May 2020,10,If I could give zero stars I would.,I will NEVER fly with UA again. They do not offer any assistance due to weather conditions. My layover in Houston was cancelled due to tornados in the area and UA went to San Antonio airport instead. I had to switch to a different flight for the morning and pay out of pocket for a hotel and food with zero assistance from the airline. My flight in the morning was also delayed an hour but they don’t care. The fact that they can treat a person like this is insane. Airlines are in the customer service industry and United has THE WORST customer service. Don’t bother
May 2020,10,No health safety during covid-19,"This airline is dangerous. Their own staff was not wearing a mask, including the women checking each persons tickets boarding the plane who had red lipstick and NO mask face to face with each passenger. Unacceptable."
May 2020,10,HORRIBLE,"I would give 0 stars if I could. Our flight was delayed 8 hours due to “weather” (original lie) but then they said the crew was at maximum hours so they couldn’t fly. I contacted United multiple times for help changing the flight or reimbursement. The first lady I talked to actually yelled at me on the phone, second person said their “hands were tied”, and the third said a customer service supervisor would call me back. No call back of course. No compensation, NOTHING. We’ve been mileage plus members for years. NOT ANYMORE."
May 2020,50,Excellent customer service,"United airlines continues to do the right thing by their customers. I booked a flight back in November to fly in April. Unfortunately that did not happen due to the pandemic. I was so impressed with the customer service agent who helped me with my refund. As soon as we are able to travel again, United Airlines will be my first choice! Thank you!"
May 2020,10,Absolutely incompetent customer service,"My original direct flight through Air Canada was canceled due to covid-19 pandemic. Air Canada rebooked the flight with a connection in Denver then taking United Airlines the rest of the way to San Diego. I had already paid for my in-cargo pet with Air Canada but now had to pay ANOTHER in cargo pet fee with United Airlines. The woman I spoke with on the phone was incompetent, charged my card twice, and did not have my email to send me the confirmation of payment! When I asked her for my dog's confirmation code and charge tracking number she gave me different numbers than what are on the email that was sent. The flight times don't even match the email she sent. Absolutely HORRIBLE experience. The customer service representative was incompetent and made my trip more stressful than it already is. If I could give a negative rating I would."
May 2020,40,August - UA5987 San Francisco to Phoenix EMB-175 (#N144SY) FC Seats 2C & D,"August - UA5987 San Francisco to Phoenix EMB-175 (#N144SY) FC Seats 2C & D    On August 14, we were returning to Phoenix, from San Francisco, and flew United UA5987 on an EMB-175 (#N144SY) in First Class, seats 2C & D. This flight was operated by SkyWest Airlines, dba United Express. Our plane had come into SFO from SAT (San Antonio, TX). We were originally scheduled to fly out of Gate 76, but that was changed to Gate 70. The United App had alerted us to this gate change, with plenty of time. The incoming plane was 5 mins late arriving, but was turned around quickly, so boarding was on-time, and so was our departure.    We like the EMB-170/175's, which were introduced to the United Express fleet about 5 years ago. It’s configured with 4 rows of 1-2 in FC, and then 4 rows of 2-2 in E+, with 12 rows of 2-2 in Economy. In First Class, the seats are 24"" wide, with a pitch of 37"", which provides very good legroom. The underseat storage is quite good, and my briefcase will fit easily there. The plane’s overhead bins are asymmetrical, with the ones on the port side of the cabin being very small - my briefcase is about as large an item, as will fit. These are above the A seats, and there is no B seat in FC. That means that all carry-ons MUST fit in the starboard side bins (above the C & D seats), or be no larger than a small briefcase/medium purse. One note: there is safety equipment stored above row 1, C & D, which takes up some space - overhead real estate can get tight, though the starboard side bins are pretty roomy. I also like that the EMB-175 has a closet forward, as we always fly in jackets.    Our flight was fairly full, with 2 FC seats available, and then 3 in Economy. All were filled, from the stand-by list, with 8 passengers on it. Two folk were moved from E/E+, to occupy those two FC seats, but as one was Row 1D, with no underseat storage, and the safety equipment above that row, it took a few minutes to find space in the overhead bins for their carry-ons, but even with that search for space, we departed on-time, with a 100% full plane.    We did not get a pre-departure beverage, as we had stopped by the AMEX Centurion Club, near Gate 75, but did get the white wine, which on United Express is the Camelot - not one of our favorite wines on United - but it’s OK - in a pinch. My wife tried the Otis Spunkmeyer Wild Blueberry Muffin, from the passed snack basket, and pronounced it to be quite good. We had not seen that offering before. I noticed that United Express had the same Spider-Man movie promo napkins - at least on the EMB-175, we did not have to see the Spider-Man safety video, as that one got very old, and very quickly. I’d rather watch the cabin crew do that safety demo, so as to not have to sit through the video again. I hope that UA gets a new safety video soon.    This EMB-175 had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) with content streamed to the United App free of charge. We did not even bother with our tablets on this short flight - beside, I was hoping to get some views of the Golden Gate Bridge. It also had WiFi (provided by Go-Go), for a fee, but neither of us used that.    On the taxiway, we got to see the progress on the remodel of T1, and the new hotel construction. Things were progressing nicely. Along we way, we observed the Southwest Airlines’ Spirit of Missouri, with unique livery. We had just seen this plane at PHX, on our July flight from PHX to SFO, and what a colorful plane it is. We took off from Runway 1L, so chances were going to be good, regarding the Golden Gate Bridge, especially as the weather was clear at SFO. Unfortunately, our turn out of SFO was tight - very tight - and we did not fly over the Golden Gate, but did get a nice view of Half Moon Bay, before heading inland. By about the Ridgecrest, CA, we began picking up heavy haze, and what looked to be smoke (forest fires?), and that lasted until about the AZ/CA border, over the Colorado River. Now, right at the junction of CA, NV and AZ, we did pass by the Ivanpah Solar Collection Array, and in the bright daylight, that is a sight, even from a distance. Usually, on the SFO-PHX flights, we pass south of Ivanpah, so it is only visible from the port side of the aircraft. The flight was nice, though as is typical, bumpy into PHX. Our flight path brought us directly onto Runway 7L, over Buckeye and Laveen, and over Estrella Mountain Regional Park.    We arrived at PHX T2, and parked at Gate 6B. Our luggage was quickly up on Carousel 4, and we were headed home.    The Gate Agents at SFO were very good. The Cabin Crew was very good, as well, and United Express did a very good job.    We arrived at Gate 3 in T2 at PHX, and our luggage was quickly out onto Carousel 4 - the “usual.” We were quickly heading home, and it was early afternoon, but my wife had two conference calls, so her work day was not yet done."
May 2020,40,August - UA1546 Phoenix to San Francisco 737-800 (#3536) FC Seats 3E & F,"August - UA1546 Phoenix to San Francisco 737-800 (#3536) FC Seats 3E & F    On August 10, we flew from our home airport in Phoenix (PHX) to San Francisco (SFO), on a 737-800SFP (#3536) in First Class, Seats 3E & F. We had taken this same flight in July, but that was on a 737-900. The PHX-SFO-PHX route is one that we likely fly 15 times per year, and once even more, but my wife’s corporate office is moving from San Francisco to Chicago. This plane had just come into PHX from Chicago O’Hare (ORD), and was at Gate 8, originally scheduled to be at Gate 7, but those are just steps away, so not an issue.    We were early, and were through TSA Security quickly, and headed for the little United Club, in T2 at PHX Airport, across from Gate 7 - our departure gate, at the time.    The United App alerted us of the gate change, but the boarding and departure times remained the same. We walked to the gate, a few minutes before boarding, and all was still on-time, with the plane sitting at the gate. We boarded before the 1K and Group 1 passengers, due to our status, and were quickly in our seats, with our jackets hanging in the closet by the galley. This early afternoon flight was not full, with about 1/4 of the E+ seats available. In July, this flight was 100% full, and it was a 737-900. We chose the Ca di Rijo Mitō sparkling wine as our pre-departure beverage, and then had the Gravelly Ford California Chardonnay. In-flight, we had a passed snack basket.    This plane was one of the newer 737-800's, with the larger overhead bins, and the new “Dreamliner” ceiling and lighting. It had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), featuring streaming content, via the United App for free, but on this short flight, neither of us used that. It also had WiFi, for a fee, but again, we did not use that.    We had taken off on-time, with a bit of Summer haze, and were soon into clouds, most of the way into SFO. As we had taken off on Runway 25R, so had a nice view of Downtown Phoenix, before we entered into the heavy haze and clouds. We took what the pilots refer to as “the surfer’s route,” heading to Moss Landing, on the Coast, before vectoring over San Jose, for final approach into SFO. Usually, this provides a nice fly-by of the Coast, but the fog was rolling in. We did get a look at San Francisco, coming in on Runway 28L.    This flight was very nice, with only some bumps our of PHX, but that is common in the Summer heat. We landed on-time, pulling into Gate 87, and our luggage was quickly up on Carousel 2. Our Cabin Crew was excellent, and both friendly and efficient."
May 2020,10,Horrible Customer Service,"We attempted to make a reservation for my grandaughter for an unaccompanied flight. We were never sent a correct invoice. They sent the incorrect invoice 4 times by email and in the end, just left us on hold. Piss poor service."
May 2020,40,August - UA254 Phoenix to Denver A320 (#4291) FC Seats 2A & B,"August - UA254 Phoenix to Denver A320 (#4291) FC Seats 2A & B    On Friday, August 02, we flew United Airlines UA254, from Phoenix (PHX) to Denver (DEN) in First Class, Seats 2A & B on an A320 (#4291). We had flown this route in May, and the plane had been an A319.    Our morning began at the United Club at PHX, with a glass of Champagne, and then walked down to Gate 3 in T2, the largest gate area in the UA gates, and the farthest from the United Club. Even with its floorspace, it the newish two lane boarding scheme made things much easier. I am a real fan of this change, which appears to now be the standard at all airports served by United. The Gate Agents like it too, from all with whom I have spoken    We boarded on-time, and were in our seats, with two glasses of the Ca’ Di Rajo Mitō sparking wine. The napkins still featured United’s ties to the movie Spider-Man: Far From Home, but as we did not have DirectTV, we did not need to sit through the Spider-Man safety video - I will be very glad, when that one has been replaced. Our seats were in the rear of First Class, and on the port side of the plane. On the A319/320 ships, the last row of FC (Row 3 on the A320) is against a bulkhead, and there are clothes hangers. As this was just one row behind me, I had my, and my wife’s jackets hanging. We settled in, for the relatively short flight up to Denver.    This A320 had the updated FC seats, which I now believe have been installed in all UA Airbus planes. In FC, there is a podium, between the 2-2 configured seats, with small drink trays, several storage areas (not for use in takeoff, or landing), and AC/USB and earphone plugs. The podium has nice marble tops. The seats are comfortable, with both good width, and ample legroom, and their recline is quite nice, plus as the rear reclines, the seat cushion slides forward, so these intrude much less on those behind a reclined seat - they take a little getting used to, as one needs to slide their hips forward, to recline. The A320 has 3 rows of FC, and though the overhead bins are adequate, the first one and a half on the starboard side of the plane are filled with safety gear, however there was plenty of room for my wife’s small, wheeled briefcase, and then my regular briefcase and hat fit below Row 1 seats, along with my wife’s purse.    We had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) streamed to our devices via the United App, but did not use this free service on this short flight. There was on-board WiFi, for a fee, but again, we did not use it.    We took off with some significant haze and high clouds, flew into more clouds. The takeoff was fairly rough, but that is common for Summer flights out of PHX. I like the port side seats for this flight, as I often get views of the Painted Desert and Meteor Crater, but the haze (seemed to be hanging below those upper-level clouds, and then the clouds themselves, precluded many good shots - some days I get lucky, but some days I do not. This was one of the latter. One highlight was that I got to see the Missouri One livery on the Southwest Airlines 737 - that is one colorful paint scheme! Also, though through that haze, I did get to see some of the reservoirs on the Rio Salado (Salt River), but just barely.    In-flight, we moved to the Gravelly Ford CA Chardonnay, which was a fairly recent addition, and a decent Chardonnay. On a few previous PHX-DEN flights, we have gotten a warmed muffin, but not on this one - maybe because it was a bit later, than our usual Denver-bound flight, or maybe how rough the takeoff was, all of the way up to cruising altitude? We did have a passed snack basket, and noticed the addition of a new chip: Lillie’s Sea Salt & Black Pepper Kettle Chips, which we had not seen before - not bad.    As per usual, our approach into Denver was rough too, and we did not break out of the clouds, until on our final. Only glimpses of the Rockies and the Front Range, through the clouds.    This flight was full, with only 6 seats in the rear of E showing, and 8 people on the waitlist.    We parked at Gate B-23 (moved from Gate B-25). The cabin crew was great, as had been the gate agents at PHX. We landed on-time, so made our way to Baggage Claim, to find that our luggage had already arrived - DEN is usually very quick at this.    In all, a very good flight, and one which is already booked again"
May 2020,40,August - UA2273 Denver to Phoenix A320 (#4275) FC Seats 2E & F,"August - UA2273 Denver to Phoenix A320 (#4275) FC Seats 2E & F    We flew United Airlines UA254, from Denver (DEN) to Phoenix (PHX) on Monday, August 05, in First Class, Seats 2A & B on an A320 (#4291). Our plane had just come in from Tampa (TPA). Originally, we were to fly on an A320, #4283, but that got changed out.    We arrived a bit early at DEN, because of the construction in the Main Terminal. On a trip about a month before, the TSA Security lines were very long, as half of the check points were closed. On this morning, though the construction seemed to be at the same point, we had last seen it, we breezed through, with plenty of time on our hands. We headed to the United Club near our departure gate, B-24. Once there, the United App alerted us to a gate, and plane change. We were now flying out of Gate A-39. That was an unusual gate for United, as they use the entire B Concourse, and also the Lufthansa gates in C. We had never experienced them flying out of A, but as they are constantly expanding their operations out of DEN, a hub for them, I guess they ran out of gates. Back to the train, and to Concourse A. We still had time, so decided to explore Concourse A a bit. We discovered the Denver Chop House & Brewery. We were living in Denver, when they opened in LoDo (Lower Downtown), and had been impressed, so stopped in for wine. We also discovered a very large sculpture in the concourse, that looked like Salvador Dalí had tried to erect one of Disney’s train rides - rather odd, yet interesting.    We boarded on-time, and were quickly into our seats, with our jackets hanging on the bulkhead hangers, just a row behind us. This flight was completely full, with all passengers checked in.    Our A320 had the updated FC seats, which I now believe have been installed in all UA Airbus planes. In FC, there is a podium, between the 2-2 configured seats, with small drink trays, several storage areas (not for use in takeoff, or landing), and AC/USB and earphone plugs. The podium has nice marble tops, and one extends for more space. The seats are comfortable, with both good width, and ample legroom (39"" Pitch and 20.5"" Width), and their recline is quite nice, plus as the rear reclines, the seat cushion slides forward, so these intrude much less on those behind a reclined seat - they take a little getting used to, as one needs to slide their hips forward, to recline. The A320 has 3 rows of 2-2 in FC, and though the overhead bins are adequate, the first one and a half on the starboard side of the plane are filled with safety gear, however there was plenty of room for my wife’s small, wheeled briefcase, and then my regular briefcase and hat fit below Row 1 seats, along with my wife’s purse. We like Row 2 because of the foot room, and the underseat storage. On a couple of recent flights, we were in Row 1, up at the bulkhead, and missed that storage space. Row 3 is fine, except that some angles of view are obstructed by the wing, and engine cowling. Row 1? Only when Rows 2, or 3 are not available.    We had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) streamed to our devices via the United App, but did not use this free service on this short flight. There was on-board WiFi, for a fee, but again, we did not use it.    Unfortunately, Gate A-39 did not offer a view of our plane, and it was not until I boarded, that I saw a plaque explaining the livery - the 1971 “Friend Ship” livery. I think that we flew on this same A320 on a trip to New Orleans, a year, or so ago. We have also seen it, or one with the same livery at LAX a few times. United has several ships with retro livery, and some from the Continental fleets of years ago, plus one for the Special Olympics, one for the employees of United, and then one for Star Wars. We have yet to see that last one. Several of their planes are done in the Star Alliance livery. We see those most often at London Heathrow and Dulles, but have only flown on one, a 777 between LHR and SFO.    Once seated, we had two glasses of the Ca’ Di Rajo Mitō sparking wine. The napkins still featured United’s ties to the movie Spider-Man: Far From Home, but on the A320, we thankfully did not have the Spider-Man safety video - that one needs to go away, and soon.    We departed on-time, and climbed through haze, and the Denver “Brown Cloud,” but as we took off to the North, we did get a fly-by of Downtown Denver, along the Front Range. However, we had barely gotten to Parker/Castle Pines, before the haze and clouds began obscuring the views. I had hoped that we would fly past Pikes Peak, but being on the starboard side of the plane, I did not see it. However, we had a bit of clearing near the Sangre de Cristo and Spanish Peaks, and then a bit around Navajo Dam, NM. It cleared more, as we got over Fountain Hills, though their giant fountain was not working. We skirted just a bit of the Painted Desert, but missed Meteor Crater. One oddity that I did observe and not too far north of Fountain Hills, was a red/orange line on the ground. All that I can imagine is that this was from a wild fire in the area, and was the drop from a fire retardant air tanker? Still, odd to see on the ground - like a giant had used a can of spray paint. Just before that point, we had also flown through a layer, of what looked like smoke, dissipating in the atmosphere above us.    We moved to still wines in-flight, and got the M Chardonnay, which was a fairly recent addition, plus the Tall Sage Colombia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, which was a new red to us. Both were quite nice. On this short flight, we had a Raisin Cookie, which was pretty good.    Our takeoff from DEN had been rough, as was our approach into PHX, but in the Summer, that is to be expected.    We arrived only a few minutes late, at Gate 7 in T2 at PHX. Our luggage was up onto Carousel 4 rather quickly.    Our Gate Agents at Denver, as well as our Cabin Crew were all very good, friendly and accommodating, as per usual, though we have had an issue, or two, with staff at DEN in the past. A very nice flight, and a new experience flying out of Concourse A."
May 2020,10,What a disrespectful company.,"After my flight was cancelled and rescheduled during a pandemic, I request a refund because my flight needed to land on that specific day. United will not refund me back the money. It's literally a global pandemic and I've been laid off and can't afford to lose $750. Sad how there is no care for their customers. I will not be flying United in the future."
May 2020,20,united flights,"disappointed with United.  my flight from Chicago to Buffalo (smaller plane) was excellent, no gripes.  however, my initial flight from Denver to Chicago (larger plane) was a little upsetting. drinks and snacks were passed out to passengers simultaneously - meaning all the passengers drop their masks to mow down simultaneously... if I didn't have the virus before, I definitely have it now. Especially considering all the air we breather in a plane is recycled. at least pass them out a little a time or not at all, come on now. wearing a mask was not enforced in the plane as well."
May 2020,40,Polaris First Class,"I hopped in my first flight since California implemented its shelter in place recommendations. After not traveling for awhile getting for the trip was both routine and new with all the travel precautions.    United swapped the originally scheduled 737 and was now flying a 787 between the two cities. The schedules condensed and now there were only three daily direct flights to ORD compared to at least six or more before.    Arriving at the airport the Premier section was closed due so I had to walk to the other side of security to check in. Everyone was wearing masks and gloves. There were no lines and I was quickly checked in. Security also was the same but I was the only person getting screened at that time. Only Burger King was open at that hour so not much food or drink options were available after security. The United Club was open but decided to save my passes. At the gate plexiglass shields were installed in front of the check in desks and all passengers were required to wear masks before they could board.    Checking the app, I knew the flight was not even half full and I was likely to get an upgrade. However United no longer confirmed the upgrade in advance but only at the gate. I saw why after a couple names were called and after a short while the agent moved on to the next one if the person was not nearby. A new boarding routine was implemented from the back first to the front with First Class last. No special global services priorities were granted. I understand the process was to limit exposure but a number of people seemed to be waiting until final boarding announcement before getting on which seemed to defeat the purpose.    Once on board the attendants handed out a small sanitizing wipe packet which I used to wipe down all the high contact surfaces like the video screen, arm rest and remote control. No hot towels on this flight! No food was served and only bottled water handed out so the only first class amenity left was to enjoy the lie flat Polaris seat and watch movies on the large screen using the upgraded headphones. Blankets were offered only upon request and individually wrapped.    The flight itself was quick with a strong tailwind.    Upon landing the disembarking routine was no longer a free for all with instructions given by the attendant. Five rows at a time were asked to get up and leave and once those people were ready to go the next five. The process was slower but was an attempt to limit exposure. Picking up my luggage also was slower and took longer than I expected before the bags finally showed up on the carousel which is like due to less staffing on the tarmac.    Overall a good flight with United trying to address the concerns of traveling during COVID-19. Some of the changes are likely permanent and probably worthwhile."
May 2020,10,United Going Down Hill Quickly,"I understand COVID is causing issues, but United is really taking advantage of things and that is just not right. My daughter and I had flights to Fort Walton Beaches and they cancelled one leg, rerouted the other, and the reroute costs more then the ticket overall. So after waiting on hold, I finally get a rep and to get me anywhere close to my flight dates and location is now more then twice as much a ticket....over $1200? So they will happily change it, but I am charged??I was willing to go in to any location with a 5 hour radius and you won't do it unless I pay twice as much? BS....if you are changing it you need to eat it and provide me with working flights on the dates for the $600 I paid per ticket. Come on United......you already owe me $2000+ for flights you have cancelled. Seems like you're concerned with saving yourself and not one bit about your customers. AGAIN!!!!"
May 2020,10,Refunds,Be careful of the wording on refunds for flights. The airline will not provide a full refund in cash back to your credit unless the flight was canceled. I read if you booked by end of May you would get a full refund. Not the case only a travel voucher that you can use for 2 years.
May 2020,10,Horrible airlines!! Stealing from people!,"We had several trips planned with many airlines.  Due to Covid we had to cancel all of our plans.    Delta, American, plus all our hotels, etc were all  So nice, sympathetic, issued full refunds too!    United didn’t care that our state is still sheltered in place.    Then United changed our non stop flight to a flight with two lay overs. Leaving earlier than we wanted to and arriving later—-We did not want that so told them we would like a refund. Nope.    They would only issue a voucher. Who knows when it will be safe to fly again. United is also cramming the planes full right now. Not leaving space for distancing!    I also had another credit they gave me for a flight I had to cancel due to Covid in March. I asked if I could at least get an extension on that credit. Nope.    United wants bailout money from the government and they want to steal money from travelers that now cannot fly and many have lost their jobs too.    Many people won’t be able to use their credits and I think they know that. Crooks!    They have even been told to give refunds by the government per an article I just read! They want to double up and take the bailout money and keep customer money.    Never flying United again!!!! Horrible!"
May 2020,20,Five Out of Five Late Flights,"I have flown with United five times to Miami, Chicago, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Newark. Every single flight, including layovers, have been delayed by an hour or more, which caused me to miss my connection in Denver when going to Chicago. The longest delay that I have experienced with United was about six hours, two of which were waited out on the taxiway. Most United planes do not have in-flight entertainment and the seats are very small. I flew a red eye to Newark for a work conference in a full flight and had to sit with my knees slightly towards the tray table. because I could not fit my legs in a regular sitting position, mind you I'm about six feet tall. I only have flown with United because of my work, but would not recommend it to anyone."
May 2020,10,Worst airline in the US ( possibly in the world...),"By far the worst airline in the US,  Most recently I had to cancel a flight to Europe, due to the COVID-19 pandemic .  United refuse to refund since ""... it does not meet eligible reasons for refund""    On top of that , base on many flights taken :    Service is non existent ( unless you are in business of course)  Food is low quality  Chair space is one of the worst in the industry    You may be asking - ""then why do you even fly with them?""...  Well - living in San Francisco area United has the most flights , but I am trying to find an alternative ...."
May 2020,40,July - UA5438 Knoxville to Chicago O’Hare EMB-175 (#N143SY) FC Seats 4C & D,"July - UA5438 Knoxville to Chicago O’Hare EMB-175 (#N143SY) FC Seats 4C & D    On July 01, we flew United Airlines UA5438, on an EMB-175 (#N143DY) from TYS to ORD, to connect with our flight home to PHX. This flight was operated by SkyWest Airlines, dba United Express. We had seats 4C & D, in First Class. Those are in the back row in the forward cabin, with a bulkhead behind. They are located on the starboard side of the plane. First Class in the EMB-175 is asymmetrical, with the A seats on the port side, no B seats, and then the C & D seats, in a 1 - 3 configuration. The overhead bins, above the A seats are small, and my briefcase barely fits there - nothing larger than a medium purse can go into those bins. The bins above the C & D seats, are rather spacious - but the first one, closest to the galley, has safety equipment in it, and the passengers in the A seats, will need to store there carry-ons in those bins too. Underseat storage is good, as there is not a lot of IFE equipment to take up space. Now, E/E+ are a conventional 2 - 2 configuration, with narrower seats, but full-size bins on both sides of the aircraft.    We started out at Ruby Tuesday in the TYS (Knoxville - Tyson/McGhee Airport, for some wine, prior to our flight to Chicago, to then head home to Phoenix, after a week at Blackberry Mountain. On the way to our gate, Gate 9, at the end of the concourse, we spent time with an art display, which had changed, since our most recent visit - lovely area. We find TYS to be a great little airport, though we did have an issue with one UA Agent, on our previous flight - still, a nice airport, with conscientious staff, and a TSA Pre-Check line, which we greatly appreciate. We also got to see one of the Cirrus Personal Jets, being built at a facility on the backside of TYS Airport. It’s a very small personal jet, and there is one hanging from the ceiling in TYS - neat, but tiny, with space for 4 passengers and a pilot - but quite interesting to see.    We were at the gate, when our incoming plane arrived, and boarded before the 1K passengers, and Group 1, due to our status with United. We were in our seats quickly, with my briefcase under the Row 3 seat, in front of me, and our jackets hanging in the little forward closet, by the galley.    Now, the EMB-175 was a fairly recent addition to the United Express fleet, and is to replace the ERJ-200/700 aircraft in time. We have already seen it take over the route between PHX and LAX, for most flights, and are happy. We like the little EMB-175, and even its smaller sibling, the EMB-170, though we have only flown it once. The cabin is roomy, and especially in the small FC section, due to the 1 - 2 seating configuration - there are no B seats, just A, then C & D. One limitation, however, is overhead storage space. The bins above the single A seats are small - very small. My briefcase will barely fit. Anything larger than a medium sized purse, will not. Even my wife’s small, rolling briefcase cannot fit, and must go into the overhead bins, above the C & D seats. Fortunately, those are rather roomy, but all of the passengers in the A seats, plus all in C & D, with roll-aboards, and cases, MUST fit them into the bins on the starboard side of the aircraft - or under the seat in front of them. To limit things a bit more, the bins above Row 1, C & D, have safety equipment, so they cannot be fully used. Just something to think about. Also, as Row 1 in FC does not have a seat, under which one can store anything, everything MUST go into the overhead bins. However, that is the only weakness that we find with the EMB-175, as the First Class seats are comfortable, with a 20"" width and 37"" pitch. The podium between the C & D seats is adequate, and has 2 AC/USB outlets for charging. The tray tables have a neat feature, in the form of a pop-up stand for one’s tablet. However, the tray table is articulated at about the 30-70% point, so that stand is not directly in front of the passenger - it is slightly offset. I wish that the designer had placed it on an angle, with a bias toward the centerline of the seat. Still, though slightly offset, it is very convenient, and close enough to the podium to allow one to charge their device, while watching it.    Now, speaking of tablets/devices, this ship had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), which provided streaming content to one’s device, via the United App, for free. We did not use it, on this short flight. It also had WiFi for a fee, but it went unused by us.    I had hopes of catching some nice photos of the edge of the Smoky Mountains, and then maybe the Chicago skyline, into ORD, but as is usually the case, we had heavy haze out of TYS, and were very quickly into the July clouds - remember, they do not call them the Smoky Mountains for no good reason. Even in the Winter, I seldom get many nice shots - too dense an atmosphere    Takeoff from TYS was on-time, and we were off to ORD for our 2:40 hr connection, for our flight home to Phoenix.    We had a mid-flight beverage/snack service, and accepted the Camelot California Chardonnay - not our favorite white wine, but what United Express has now served for about 4 years - out of a tiny plastic bottle. We were looking forward to our layover at ORD, to get some good wines.    We broke out of the clouds, over Lake Michigan, and did get a hazy view of the Ravenswood/Uptown Area, but none of the skyline, as we were on the starboard side of the plane, on approach to ORD.    We landed at E-12, and made our way to our departure gate, C-29, moved from C-28, and got to walk the neon-filled tunnel between Concourses B and C, which is always a bit of a treat. We now had time for some better wine.    A very nice, short flight, with a good Cabin Crew."
May 2020,40,July - UA2339 San Francisco to Phoenix 737-900 (#3422) FC Seats 2E & F,"July - UA2339 San Francisco to Phoenix 737-900 (#3422) FC Seats 2E & F    After a few days of meetings in San Francisco, on July 23, we flew UA2339 from SFO to PHX on a 737-900 (#3422) in First Class, in Seats 2E & F.    We arrived a bit early to SFO, so had time on our hands. This was an evening flight, and was departing from Gate 74. We decided to grab dinner, as we were not going to get to PHX, until 9:30pm. We decided to look down the West Pier, to see what looked good, and stopped along the way to enjoy the SFO Museum exhibit on the West Pier. Though we had seen it, just as they were setting up the displays, there were several new ones, which had only been vacant spaces on the earlier visit. Finding nothing of interest down that way, we came back to the main Concourse in T3, and decided to try Gordon Biersch, as it had been a rather long time, since we had eaten there. During dinner, the United App alerted us that our gate had move to 65, way back in the East Pier - but we still had plenty of time, so no rush.    We walked to the East Pier and to Gate 65, and were ready to board, just before Group 1. With our briefcases stored (wife’s in overhead, and mine under the seat in front of me), and our jackets hanging in the forward closet by the galley, we settled in for our pre-departure beverage.    We had flown into SFO with heavy haze and smoke from the wildfires, and would be flying out with the same weather.    This plane was from the Continental side of the fleet, and had DirectTV. It was also one of the older 737's with the old ceiling, and smaller overhead bins. A downside of the sCO part of the fleet of 737's, is that the DirectTV equipment takes up a fair amount of the underseat storage, but my wife’s rolling briefcase fit nicely above, and with a bit of wedging, my briefcase fit below the seat in front of me. There was even room for her purse, and my hat. With DirectTV, the safety demo is a video, and this one linked to the Spider Man movie. Though this new safety demo was just starting its run, I had already grown tired of it, just as the Spider Man napkins were becoming boring too. Hope that there will be a new demo soon!    We took off on Runway 1L, and that often means a view of the Golden Gate Bridge, but our immediate turn was tighter, than any I can recall, and we looped back over SFO, and then over the lower tip of San Francisco Bay and the salt ponds - something that we have never done before. No Golden Gate Bridge on this flight, but the salt ponds were colorful in the evening light. Almost immediately, we were into the clouds, and only caught a few brief glimpses of the ground, all the way into PHX, where night had descended.    The flight was very good, and the DirectTV worked well (not always the case), and that made me happy, as with the haze, clouds and smoke, there was not much to see outside the window.    We arrived at PHX T2, and parked at Gate 6B. Our luggage was quickly up on Carousel 4, and we were headed home.    The Gate Agents at SFO were very good, and we actually knew one, from our frequent flights out of SFO. The Cabin Crew was good, as well, and United made this short business trip as comfortable, as they could."
May 2020,40,June - UA5435 Phoenix to Los Angeles ERJ-175 (#N116SY) FC Seats 1C & D,"June - UA5435 Phoenix to Los Angeles ERJ-175 (#N116SY) FC Seats 1C & D    On Tuesday, June 04, we flew United Airlines UA5435, from Phoenix (PHX) to Los Angeles (LAX), as the first leg of a business trip to Las Vegas, in First Class, Seats 1C & D on an EMB-175 (#N116SY), operated by SkyWest Airlines, dba United Express. This plane was doing a yo-yo route, between LAX and PHX, and had already done one flight each way, this morning.    As we often do, we started the morning at the little United Club at PHX, with a glass of Champagne, and then walked down to Gate 7 in T2, which is basically across from the UA Club.    We boarded within 5 mins of schedule, and had taken our seats, before Group 1 was called - status does have benefits, and especially as we were in Row 1, with zero underseat storage - everything, and I mean everything, had to go into the overhead bins. On the UA EMB-175's, there are 4 rows of seats, in a 1-2 configuration, in First Class. These are designated A and then C & D, with no B seats. The overhead bins above the A seats is very small, but long ago, I realized that my small briefcase fit perfectly there - though not much else, besides a medium-sized purse will. My wife’s small wheeled-briefcase does fit nicely in the bins, above the C-D seats (starboard side of the plane), and there is a convenient closet by the galley in FC, where our jackets were hung. The only downside is that the first bins, above the C & D seats, do have safety equipment in them, and with most FC passengers having to share, that does take up some real estate - but not on today’s flight, as there was still some room overhead.    We fly a lot of UAExpress planes, and fell in love with the little EMB-175, when they first introduced it. Unfortunately, we still have to fly many (too many) CRJ-400/700, and EMB-145 ships. I try my best not to, but often have no choice. Once, the UAX CRJ-700 had a closet, but that was removed for one more row of seats in Economy.    The seats are quite comfortable, with good pitch (even in Row 1, at the bulkhead), and good width, plus comfortable lower cushions, at 37"" pitch and 20"" width.. The width is slightly reduced, as the tray tables are in the fixed armrests. Even in Row 1, which is never our choice - but sometimes, one has no choices - we find the EMB-175 to be a comfortable plane.    In the podium, between the C & D seats, we had two AC/USB outlets, and power to charge one of my camera batteries on this flight. Actually, access to those outlets is better in Row 1, and the other FC rows, due to the pitch of the seats in front.    On this short flight, we only did a glass of the Camelot, CA Chardonnay, but did try a new Paqui chip flavor “Mucho Nacho,” from the passed snack basket. We both decided that we liked the “original” Paqui chips better, but you never know, until you try.    Our Flight Attendant was great, and very friendly, and especially as this was her third flight of the morning - back and forth between LAX and PHX.    This plane did have PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), providing streaming content to one’s personal device, and this service is free. Because of the short duration, neither of us used it. I did not even notice if it had WiFi, which is always for a fee, or not.    We took off into bright skies, with broken clouds out of PHX, but quickly were into some haze. The flight was smooth, and uneventful, beyond just great service, and we landed a few moments early at LAX - also with even more significant haze, and some low clouds. Soon, we would be taking off in this. We had time for more wine, before the second half of this trip, to Las Vegas."
May 2020,40,UA1638 Phoenix to Houston A320 (#4634) FC Seats 2A & B,"June - UA1638 Phoenix to Houston A320 (#4634) FC Seats 2A & B    On June 08, we flew United UA1638 from Phoenix (PHX) to Houston (IAH) on an Airbus A320 (#4634 - changed from #4622) in First Class, Seats 2A & B, as the first leg of a business trip to Dallas. We were connecting at IAH, for our second leg, on to DFW. I know that PHX-IAH-DFW is a bit of a long routing, but that is often what we do, to fly United. We had just returned from meetings in Las Vegas, and barely had time to wash clothes, and repack for Dallas, but managed to get everything done.    We started our morning in the little United Club, down by Gate 7, in T2 at PHX, and then walked down to our departure gate, Gate 3. Gate 3 is the largest, and most spacious gate in T2, and shares a bit of space with the smaller Gate 1, which is only used for a few flights by SunCoast Airlines, so seems even larger. Looking at the seating chart, and waitlist, I saw that the plane was almost full, with only 3 E+ seats remaining, and 8 people on the waitlist. Full planes have been what we have come to expect on this route, and this was going to be another of those. We boarded before Group 1, due to our status, and had situated our carry-on luggage quickly - my wife’s small rolling briefcase in the fairly spacious overhead, and my briefcase and hat, below the Row 1 seats. We both had good legroom, and though in Row 2, the taper of the fuselage did not intrude on my footroom, as on some aircraft. Seat 2A was quite comfortable, and I like the newish First Class seats better on the A319/320 ships, than on United’s 737-800/900 craft - just more comfortable.    Our jackets were hanging on the bulkhead, behind Row 3. If this had been an A319, that bulkhead is behind Row 2.    We had the Prosecco as our pre-departure beverage, and both glasses fit nicely on the marble-topped podium, between the A & B seats. First Class on the United A320's is a 2-2 configuration.    Our flight had free streaming PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) via the United App, and it worked well. It also had WiFi in-flight, for a fee, but we did not use that.    We took off on Runway 7L, into a slightly hazy sky. That haze intensified, as we vectored toward the Southeast, toward Houston.    About 45 mins into the flight, we had a “snack,” for breakfast, with a choice of:  Egg Frittata w/ spinach, and a tomato/pepper sauce - also not bad, and a common breakfast “snack” out of PHX on UA flights lately.  A Bowl of cold cereal w/ milk - how good can a bowl of cereal be?  Both came with the Chobani Yogurt (mixed berry), a small fruit bowl, and one’s choice of bread    I moved to the Gravelly Ford California Chardonnay ‘17, and my wife switched over to the Illy Decaf.    We experienced some clearing, into IAH, which is not that common - usually heavy haze and clouds, and especially in the Summer. The flight was smooth, and quite nice.  The cabin crew was very good, as had been the Gate Agents at PHX. We arrived a few minutes early, at Gate C-2, so had more than the planned 1:09 connection at IAH. We had time to stop by the United Club, near our departure gate, C-31."
May 2020,40,UA1546 Phoenix to San Francisco 737-900 (#3436) FC Seats 4E & F,"July - UA1546 Phoenix to San Francisco 737-900 (#3436) FC Seats 4E & F    We flew from our home airport PHX (Phoenix) to SFO (San Francisco) on July 20, on a 737-900ER (#3436) in First Class, Seats 4E & F. This was for a business trip, and San Francisco was our only destination on this trip.    We arrived a bit early, so headed for the little United Club, in T2 at PHX Airport, across from Gate 7 - our departure gate. We noticed that there was a new addition to the limited buffet - hummus and pita chips (the tortilla chips were better). We are going to miss this intimate little United Club, when United’s operations move over to Terminal 3. I think that we have spent more time in this Club, than our own home!    We walked to the gate, a few minutes before boarding, and all was on-time, with the plane sitting at the gate. We boarded before the 1K and Group 1 passengers, due to our status, and were quickly in our seats, with our jackets hanging in the closet by the galley. This early afternoon flight was filled, except for 2 seats in E+, and with 5 people on the waitlist. Sometimes the mid-day flights were not quite at capacity on the PHX-SFO route. We soon had our pre-departure beverages, the Ca di Rijo Mitō sparkling wine, and then encountered a new white wine from United - the M (by Meka Cellars) California Chardonnay - not bad - for our in-flight beverage. We were in Row 4, seats E&F. This plane was from the Continental side of the fleet, so had DirectTV. The plane did not have the newer interior, with the “Dreamliner” ceiling and lighting, and also had the old, smaller overhead bins. While clean, it was starting to show wear and tear. The only downside of the sCO part of the fleet of 737's, is that the DirectTV equipment takes up a fair amount of the underseat storage, but my wife’s rolling briefcase fit nicely above, and with a bit of wedging, my briefcase fit below the seat in front of me. There was even room for her purse, and my hat. With DirectTV, the safety demo is a video, and this one linked to the Spider Man movie, with lots of scenes of Spider Man getting folk to comply with the instructions - even the napkins featured a plug for the upcoming movie.    We had taken off on-time, with a bit of haze, but that increased fairly dramatically, before we were beyond the western edge of Metro-Phoenix. As we had taken off on Runway 25R, so had a nice view of Downtown Phoenix, before we entered into the heavy haze.    We had a passed snack basket, and had the M Chardonnay, on the short (2:08 hrs scheduled, but actually 1:48 hr on this day), which was smooth after we got away from PHX, and its heat.    We had haze, and probably smoke from several forest fires, all of the way into SFO. We flew “the surfers’ route,” crossing over the coast, south of SFO, to the Pacific, and then north along the shore, before turning slightly to Palo Alto, for our final approach onto Runway 28L    The flight was very nice, and the DirectTV functioned for the entire flight. Our Cabin Crew was very good, and both welcoming and efficient. We arrived at Gate 66 (East Pier) in SFO T3, and our luggage was up fairly quickly onto Carousel 2 - about as far from the East Pier, as one can get in baggage claim - but that walk gave the handlers time to get the baggage onto the carousel.    *****************************************  On Tuesday, January 15, we flew United Airlines UA2351 from Phoenix (PHX) to San Francisco (SFO) in First Class, on a 737-900ER (#3439). We were in Row 3 E&F. This ship was from the Continental side of the fleet, so had DirectTV. This plane did not have the newer interior, with the “Dreamliner” ceiling and lighting, and also had the old, smaller overhead bins. The only downside of the sCO part of the fleet of 737's, is that the DirectTV equipment takes up a fair amount of the underseat storage, but my wife’s rolling briefcase fit nicely above, and with a bit of wedging, my briefcase fit below the seat in front of me..    We started this trip in the PHX United Club, in T2, across from Gate 7, with the Moët et Chandon Brut Champagne, but then moved to the O.H.S.O. restaurant, across from Gate 7 in T2, when our flight was delayed, due to ATC issues at SFO. Since we were going to miss lunch in San Francisco, this seemed like a good idea. This allowed us to keep an eye on our gate, and be prepared to join the boarding, should the Ground Hold be lifted early. We had just flown from LAX to SFO, then home to PHX a few days before, and the weather was bad then, and had not improved at all. Also, on this morning, the weather at PHX was not all that much better, with heavy clouds, but no rain, yet. Having the UA App, plus the constant updates from the Gate Agents, was comforting, especially as the delay extended.    One little oddity was how many seats were available on this flight. We had observed the same, the week before, when we flew United from PHX to LAX to SFO, and then SFO back to PHX. We fly this route monthly, and in some months, several times, and we are used to seeing most flight full, or very nearly so. I assume that being just after the New Year, and also the lousy weather on the California Coast, were likely contributing to the flights being only partially full - just uncommon to see so many available seats on these routes, on United.    Finally, boarding began at Gate 7, and we were in our seats. It was interesting, looking across the tarmac from T2 Gate 7, at the progress that was being made with T3. Delta was already operating at full schedule from that terminal, with United scheduled to move in, in early 2020.    We pushed back, and were on our way, after a glass of the Spumante for my wife, and a glass of the Fortant Cabernet Sauvignon for me, as our pre-departure beverage. During the brief flight, we had a passed snack basket, but as we had shared a Turkey Sandwich across from our gate, declined.    This ship, #3439, was showing a bit of wear-and-tear, as the seatback pocket’s elastic band had broken, and the carpet was showing some wear, as well.    We took off on Runway 25R, so had a nice view of Downtown Phoenix, before we entered into the heavy clouds. The short flight was smooth, and we just continued with the same wines for the next 1:25. We landed on Runway 28L, and were at Gate 64 (moved from Gate 74) in a few minutes.    Our luggage was out onto Carousel 2, which is some distance from the East Pier exit, down to baggage claim.    Our Gate Agents at PHX, and our cabin crew were excellent, and the flight smooth, albeit 2 hrs 18 mins late in arriving."
May 2020,40,June - UA656 Phoenix to Chicago 737-900 (#3832) FC Seats 4A & B,"June - UA656 Phoenix to Chicago 737-900 (#3832) FC Seats 4A & B    On June 27, we flew United Airlines UA656 from PHX to ORD on a 737-900 (#3832) in First Class, seats 4A & B. This was a pleasure trip, for 5 days in the Smoky Mountains, and was the first leg of our PHX-ORD-TYS trip. This was also a flight that we take often, as my wife has several meetings in Chicago, and we had just flown it back in April, but on a different 737-900.    We began our morning (7:35am departure) at the United Club, near Gate 7 in Terminal T2 at PHX. Our flight departed from the near-by Gate 6A. As per usual, our plane was at the gate, having arrived from ORD, the evening before.    We boarded on-time, and as we board before the 1K and Group 1 passengers, were quickly into our seats, and ordered sparkling wine (Ca’ di Rajo Mitō), for the pre-departure beverage. We noted that the napkins were promoting the new Spider Man movie, as was the Safety Film on our DirectTV.    Boarding was completed rather quickly for a 737-900, which was pretty much filled, and we pushed back from the gate on-time. We some haze and smoke, which seemed to get more dense, the farther from PHX we got. Takeoff was on Runway 25R, so we were already pointed east.    This was one of the older 737-900's from the Continental side of the merged fleet, with the older ceiling and interior lighting, and it had DirectTV. The DirectTV is free, and convenient, but the equipment for it does take up some of the underseat storage space. On this flight, it worked well. There was also WiFi (for a fee), but neither of us used that.    The interior of the cabin had the older, smaller overhead bins, but my wife’s small, wheeled briefcase fit easily. My briefcase did fit below the seat, but it was a tight squeeze with the equipment boxes.    Our jackets were hung in the closet, forward, and across from the galley. The seat width is very good, as is the legroom. The windows are more evenly aligned with the seats in Row 4, than they are in Row 1, where we were seated on the previous flight to Chicago    This 737-900 had 5 rows in First Class, in a 2-2 configuration, then 7 rows (port side) and 8 (starboard) of 3-3 in E+, with 16 rows of 3-3 in Economy. The FC seats are 21"" wide, with a 38"" pitch, which provides plenty of legroom, even with the DirectTV equipment. The FC seats are fine, and fairly comfortable, but we have grown fond of the FC seats in the Airbus A-319/320's, which were refurbished about 5 years ago, across the fleet. We also like the cabins in the newer 737-800/900 ships, with the larger overhead bins, and “Dreamliner” ceilings and lighting - but the seats are the same, as on this plane.    Since this was the “breakfast flight,” we had our choice between:  Smoked-turkey Salad w/ boiled egg, almonds and cheese - which was actually pretty good  Egg Frittata w/ spinach, and a tomato/pepper sauce - also not bad  Both came with the Chobani Yogurt (mixed berry), a small fruit bowl, and one’s choice of bread - and we both chose the biscuits, which for being served at 30,000' were good, also..    I switched to the Gravelly Ford California Chardonnay, while my wife switched over to coffee.    The haze and clouds increased, and I missed one aspect of this flight, that always intrigues me, flying over part of The Painted Desert, and then the edge of the Rocky Mountains, but there were but brief glimpses, as the pilot dodged some pretty significant thunderstorms - I was glad to have the DirectTV. The clouds broke a bit, into ORD, but we did our final approach straight in, so no fly-over of Chicago and Lake Michigan, as we have had on several of our last flight.    A good flight, with only some bumps out of PHX, but in June, that is to be expected. The Gate Agents at PHX were great, and our Cabin Crew very good too. We were due to arrive at Gate B-12, but then changes began: C-24, B-9 (B-8 and B-10 were empty, but awaiting incoming flights), and finally to C-16 - it was empty, and we were still within 5 of our scheduled arrival. This was good, as we only had 1:07 hrs before our connection to TYS, and out of E-5, so a walk from C through B then over to the E Gates - should be plenty of time."
May 2020,40,UA5381 Chicago to Knoxville EMB-175 (#N105SY) FC Seats 2C & D,"June - UA5381 Chicago to Knoxville EMB-175 (#N105SY) FC Seats 2C & D    On Thursday, June 27, we flew United Airlines flight UA5381, from Chicago O’Hare (ORD), to Knoxville McGhee Tyson (TYS), on a EMB-175 (#N105SY), operated by SkyWest, dba United Express, in First Class, seats 2C & D. This was a departure from the norm, in that United Express normally flies a CRJ-200, or EMB-145 (our two least favorite planes in the fleet) on this short route.    We stopped into the United Club on the F Concourse at T1 ORD, though we were flying our of the near-by E Concourse - the Club is really close to both.    We arrived at Gate E-5 with plenty of time, and boarded just before Group 1, due to our status with UA. We were quickly to our seats in First Class, and our jackets hung in the small closet, near the galley. This is one of the features, which we appreciate in the EMB-175, and especially over the CRJ-200/700* and EMB-145, where our jackets have to be folded and stuffed into the overhead bins, or under the seat.  * Early on, United Express CRJ-700's did have a closet forward, but those were all removed some years ago, for one extra row of Economy seats.    The EMB-170/175 was introduced to the United Express fleet about 5 years ago, and we have come to enjoy it quite a bit. It’s configured with 4 rows of 1-2 in FC, and then 4 rows of 2-2 in E+, with 12 rows of 2-2 in Economy. In First Class, the seats are 20"" wide, with a pitch of 37"", which provides very good legroom. The underseat storage is quite good, and my briefcase will fit easily there. The overhead bins are asymmetrical, with the ones on the port side of the cabin being very small - my briefcase is about as large an item, as will fit. These are above the A seats, and there is no B seat in FC. That means that all carry-ons MUST fit in the starboard side bins (above the C & D seats), or be no larger than a small briefcase/medium purse. Also, there is safety equipment stored above row 1, C & D, which takes up some space - overhead real estate can get tight, though the starboard side bins are pretty roomy.    Because we had just left the Unite Club, we declined a pre-departure beverage.    We left the gate on-time, and quickly climbed into some fairly heavy clouds, though it was mostly clear at ORD. We did not have any clearing, until final approach to TYS.    Mid-flight (only 1:43 hr stated flight time, but always closer to 1:20), there was a passed snack tray, and it had a newish Drizzilicious Cinnamon Swirls, which we had first seen on a United Express flight between IAH and DFW the week before - OK, but nothing to get excited about, other than that they were a new addition. My wife got a Chardonnay, which on UAX is the Camelot California Chard, served in a tiny plastic bottle. I declined for a Ginger-ale, as I am just not a fan of the Camelot.    Our EMB-175 had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) with content streamed to the United App free of charge. We did not even bother with our tablets on this short flight - beside, I was hoping to get some views of the Smoky Mountains, near TYS, but that was not to be. The ship also had WiFi for a charge, but we did not use that either.    The flight was fairly smooth, once above the cloud cover, but did get a bit bumpy into TYS. We arrived on-time, at Gate 9 in the small TYS terminal.    The Gate Agents at ORD were excellent, as was the Cabin Crew on this flight. A very pleasant short commuter flight, and on a plane, that we have learned to enjoy."
May 2020,40,UA1603 Chicago O’Hare to Phoenix A-320 (#4620) FC Seats 2E & F,"July - UA1603 Chicago O’Hare to Phoenix A-320 (#4620) FC Seats 2E & F    We had a 2:40 hr connection at ORD flying home from TYS (Knoxville, TN), we flew UA1603, on an Airbus A320 (#4620), in First Class, Seats 2E & F. The weather was very cloudy, when we landed, with a lot of haze. While it did not look like an issue getting out of ORD, we were watching the weather closely.    We started to go to the United Club at C-16, but it was so very full, that we decided to go to, Beaudevin, a wine bar, just across the concourse. As they have an interesting wine list, that is not a bad choice.    We made our way to Gate C-29, moved from C-28, when it was time to board, and right on time, we took our seats, for the flight home.    Our jackets were hung on the bulkhead behind Row 3, and we were settled in for our flight home. We settled back for the Gravelly Ford California Chardonnay.    We took off into the haze, and were very quickly into the clouds, which persisted almost all of the way into PHX. Nothing much to see down below.    This A320, like all of United’s AirBus fleet now, had the newish FC seats, which are very nice, with a marble-topped podium, with marble drink drawer. They also have several pockets to hold items, but those must be stored elsewhere, for takeoff and landing. These seats recline a bit differently, in that the lower cushion slides forward, and the rear cushion to pivot, without intruding too much, into the space behind. The forward, and locked position has a bit too much recline built in, and I wish that they would go just a few degrees more forward. We like the First Class seats in the United Airbus ships a bit more, than those in the 737-800/900's. Now, the newer 737's do have slightly larger overhead bins, but those on the Airbus planes are larger, than on the older 737's. The general available room is similar (except for Row 1 seats at the bulkhead), with the A320 seats having a 20.5"" width and a 39"" pitch. First Class is 3 rows of 2-2,    This plane had the PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) which feeds content to one’s device, through the United App. The latest version must be present, or downloaded, before the doors are closed. The streaming PDE worked fine, and that is a good thing, as there was nothing to see out of the window. This service is free. There was also WiFi available, for a fee, but neither of us used that. One nice feature of the A320 is that the tray tables in FC, have a holder for a tablet/phone. However, I find that this could be more centered, as viewing is at a slight, but noticeable angle.    We did get the warm Mixed Nuts after takeoff on this flight, and that has been rather hit-or-miss, on the PHX-ORD-PHX route lately - sometimes yes, but sometimes no?    This was a late afternoon flight, so we had dinner:  Grilled Chicken w/ pesto sauce and peppers and a small mixed-salad - one of the better dishes I can recall recently. It was not as good as the old, now gone Eastern Airlines, who had a great Baked Chicken, and I am not normally a fan of Baked Chicken, but their’s was excellent!  Beef Udon Noodle Salad w/ peppers - this version did not have the ultra-sweet “Thai-style” sauce on it, and my wife liked it much better, than some earlier variations.    Both meals came with a good Itallian bun, and a slice of Strawberry Cheesecake - not my favorite of United’s Cheesecakes, but not bad. [Their Ginger Carrot Cheesecake is very good.]    We did the Gravelly Ford California Chardonnay, and the Château Villotte ‘16, a Bordeaux Blend - both of which were fairly recent introductions to United’s Domestic First Class wine lists. Both are actually pretty good, and especially for being served at 30,000'.    Our flight path probably looked like that of a drunken sailor, as the pilot had to deviate around lots of thunderstorms, but kept finding clean air, so the flight was mostly smooth, with only a rough spot, or two, coming out of ORD, then, as always, bumps coming into PHX.    Just outside of Phoenix, the weather cleared nicely, so we had some pretty views of the mountains, in late afternoon light.    The 3:50 hr flight went well, with a great Cabin Crew. The staff at ORD had been quite nice, and efficient. We landed pretty much on-time, and arrived at Gate 5 in T2 of PHX. Our luggage arrived fairly quickly onto Carousel 4 - every now and then, PHX throws me a curve, and sends our luggage to Carousel 2 - but not that often."
May 2020,40,UA5512 Los Angeles to Phoenix EMB-175 (#N108SY) FC Seats 3C & D,"June - UA5512 Los Angeles to Phoenix EMB-175 (#N108SY) FC Seats 3C & D    After dinner at Engine Company #28, in T8 at LAX, we flew United Airlines UA5512 home to Phoenix (PHX), on an EMB-175 (N108SY), in First Class, in seats 3C & D. The flight was operated by Skywest Airlines, dba United Express. This was our fourth United flight of the week.    We walked over to Gate 86B (our departure gate), and boarded before Group 1, due to our status. We took our seats on the starboard side of the plane, and near the rear of First Class. The EMB-175 is configured 1-2 in First Class, with 4 rows of seats, then E and E+ are 2-2. One limitation in FC is that the bins above the A seats, are tiny, but my small briefcase fits - though not much more than a medium-sized purse would. That means that all FC passengers, will mostly need the larger bins, above the C & D seats. Also, a bit of the bin real estate is used for safety equipment, at the front of the FC cabin. As those starboard bins are pretty generous, my wife’s wheeled briefcase fit easily. The EMB-175 has good underseat storage in FC, unlike several other Regional Jets in the UA fleet. Another aspect, which I like about this plane is that it has a closet, near the galley, unlike the CRJ-200/700's and the EMB-145's. As we always fly with our jackets, the closet is greatly appreciated.    I had a pre-departure “red wine,” but never saw the label, and was so unimpressed, that I did not have any more wine (waiting to get home to “good wine”), plus I had also had a couple of glasses with dinner. There was a passed snack basket, but we did not even look at it.    This EMB-175 had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), which is streamed for free, to one’s device, but on the short 1:32 hr flight (actual flight time was 1:18), neither of us used it. It also had WiFi, for a fee, but it went unused, as well.    We took off to heavy haze and low clouds at LAX (exactly what we had encountered a few days before, on our outbound flights), and when visibility cleared a bit, there was an odd “cloud pattern” that could have been smoke, or perhaps fog, that stretched inland for quite some ways - all of the way to the CA/AZ border. It seemed to follow along the canyons, and resembled smoke, more than fog, which we encounter often, flying into/out of West Coast airports. With the setting sun, it was visually interesting, as well.    We landed at PHX, on-time, and to some broken, high clouds, but also a fair bit of haze too. Outbound from LAX was a bit rough, and we picked up some bumps into PHX, but in Summer, that is always to be expected - just like into/out of DEN and LAS. We flew over Laveen and Buckeye, for our final approach from the East, onto Runway 26, which meant that we would have to taxi around the entire airport, to get to T2, and our gate, Gate 3. Our luggage came out rather quickly onto Carousel 4, and we were headed home with 2 days to wash clothes, and re-pack for a flight to Dallas, and more meetings for my wife.    The short flight was good, with a good Cabin Crew, and on a plane, which we have come to enjoy, the EMB-175. We strongly prefer it to the other Regional Jets in UA/UAX’s fleet."
May 2020,40,June - UA204 Los Angeles to Las Vegas 737-800 (#3225) FC Seats 3A & B,"June - UA204 Los Angeles to Las Vegas 737-800 (#3225) FC Seats 3A & B    On June 04, we flew United UA204 from Los Angeles (LAX) to Las Vegas (LAS) on an older 737-800 (#3225), in First Class, Seats 3A & B. This was the second leg of our business trip to Las Vegas, from our home airport PHX in Phoenix.    We had arrived at LAX T8, from PHX, and had some wine over there, before walking over to T7, for our departing flight to LAS, out of Gate 70B. One thing that we noticed was that the ceiling in T8 had finally been completed, but work was still being done at T7. As we still had time, prior to boarding, we got two more glasses of wine at the Rolling Stone restaurant, in the hub of T7, and near our gate.    The plane was from the Continental Airlines side of the merger, and had DirectTV. It worked fine, for the short flight to LAS. One downside of the DirectTV is that the IFE equipment takes up some of the underseat storage space, so my small briefcase, and hat were rather tight fits. This was also an older sCO 737-800, so the overhead bins were the small ones, but my wife’s wheeled briefcase fit easily. The newer 738's and 739's, with the “Dreamliner” ceiling/lighting, have improved, larger bins. Still, everything fit.    Though older, this ship was in good condition, and the FC seats were comfortable - not the best we have ever had, but comfortable, with good pitch/legroom, and width.    With our status, we board before Group 1, so were in our seats, with a pre-departure Chardonnay. One thing, which we noticed was the tie-in between United and the newest Spider-Man movie - the safety video was done with a Spider-Man theme, and the napkins promoted the movie. Personally, I thought that the safety film was rather lame. Even though we fly weekly, and have for years, we both still pay attention to the safety films, or demonstrations. Over the last few years, UA has had some pretty good safety videos - but this was not one of them.    One note on the podium tray, between the seats in FC (2-2 configuration) is that the little drink tray, does not have a lip on the forward section. Be careful, as things can slip off.    Our flight attendants were very friendly, and very efficient on the 1:23 hr flight (actual flight time was only 1:02).    We took off into the same heavy haze and low clouds, that we had encountered on our arrival, but did get some clearing, outside of Las Vegas.    We landed LAS pretty much on-time, and parked at Gate D55, with baggage out in a timely manner, onto Carousel 22, at the far end of Baggage Claim.    In all, a good flight, with a good cabin crew."
May 2020,40,June - UA1807 Las Vegas to Los Angeles 737-800 (#3515) FC Seats 3A & B,"June - UA1807 Las Vegas to Los Angeles 737-800 ($3515) FC Seats 3A & B    We were flying United Airlines on June 06, from Las Vegas (LAS) to Los Angeles (LAX), on the first leg of our return home to Phoenix (PHX). We flew on an older 737-800, from the Continental side of the fleet, with DirectTV. We were in First Class, in Seats 3A & B, so on the port side of the plane.    We arrived at LAS a bit early, so had time to spend in both the United Club and the AMEX Centurion Club in T3, near the D Gates. We also grabbed a quick bite at the Burke in a Box, near D-54.    Our arriving plane was just a bit late too - so we had time on our hands.    We boarded about 20 mins late, for the 1:16 hr flight over to LAX, and were in our seats quickly. This 737-800 was also one of the older ships, with the smaller overhead bins, but my wife’s small rolling briefcase fit just fine. Because of the DirectTV equipment, under the seat, I had to work a bit, to get my small briefcase to fit, but it did - along with my hat. The DirectTV worked fine, though I really did not pay much attention to it.    For our pre-departure beverage, I had a glass (well, a plastic cup) of the Château Villotte Bordeaux red blend (fairly new addition to the UA wine list, and not bad - even in a plastic cup), while my wife had the Gravelly Ford California Chardonnay (also a newish wine to the list, and also not bad).    We took off with some haze and high clouds, and both intensified, the closer we got to LAX. It was about the same weather we had encountered a few days before, on the outbound flights on this trip.    We had a passed snack basket, but declined. It also had the new Paqui chip flavor, but we had been unimpressed with that, on our inbound flight.    We got to see the new Spider-Man safety video again, and I liked it even less, than on the first viewing. Hope this one gets replaced soon. Also, the Spider-Man napkins were prominent, as well, and we got those, for our in-flight wines.    The quick flight was a bit bumpy out of LAS, smooth in between, with more bumpiness, into LAX.    We landed at LAX only a few minutes late, but had a rather long connection for our flight to PHX, so decided to get something to eat at LAX. Oddly, we arrived at Gate 83, which is unusual, as mostly UAExpress flights use T8. We were originally set to use Gate 76A, which is much more common.    This was a very good flight, and though a few moments late, did not impact on our schedule, negatively. The Gate Agents, and the Flight Attendants were excellent."
May 2020,10,Complaints,I was clearly told at the time of booking my flight that due to covid 19 the middle seats will be blocked. In the airplane most of the middle seats were full and i was seating next to 2 other people without any distance. I asked them and they said they have more passengers and this is it. I called customer service and talked to Manager name Maria Diaz and she said they assumed that some people will not show up to the flight and they will spread out passenger but that didnt happen! I asked to be transferred to her manager and she hanged up on me. WILL NEVER EVER TRY THIS AGENECY WHO DO NOT CARE ABOUT PEOPLES HEALTH. I had to take that flight since my sister had a surgery and I had to leave. Other than that this is the most disappointing and disgusting experience and people I have ever seen in my life.
May 2020,40,June - UA1115 Houston to Phoenix 737-700 (#3701) FC Seats 2E & F,"June - UA1115 Houston to Phoenix 737-700 (#3701) FC Seats 2E & F    On Tuesday, June 11, we flew home to Phoenix (PHX) from Houston (IAH), where we had earlier connected from Dallas (DFW), on UA1115, on a 737-700 (#3701), in First Class, seats 2 E & F.    We had arrived at Gate C-35, and were departing C-15 (moved from C-12). Initially, we had a 1:11 hr connection, but had arrived early, so had time to grab a few glasses of wine, at Olio Panini, right by our departure gate.    We boarded only a few minutes late, just before Group 1, and were seated, with our jackets hanging in the forward closet.    This 737-700, was from the Continental side of the fleet, and had an older cabin, and smaller overhead bins, but wife’s wheeled briefcase fit nicely. My briefcase fit under the seat in front, but had to go in the middle section, as the IFE (DirectTV) equipment took up quite a bit of that underseat real estate. This might have been the first 737-700 we had ever flown with United. It was odd to me, in that it did not have the same seats, as all other UA 737-800/900 ships have had, even those from the sCO fleet. Some years ago, United upgraded their seats in First Class, on their Airbus A319/320 ships. It was a very nice refurbishment, and we really like those seats, better than First Class on the Boeing ships - but only by a little bit. This Boeing had the seats and podium from the Airbus A319/320's! However, with the DirectTV, there were some differences - sort of a hybrid. It was like having a Chevrolet Monte Carlo, and finding out that it had seats from a Lincoln Towncar. Now, the seats are nice, but differ from those in the A319/320 in the UA fleet. The seats work the same way, with a nice sliding recline, that does not intrude much on the row behind, and there are lots of little pockets, plus the marble-topped podium, but with DirectTV, there are some differences: the seats have a lot of IFE equipment, and with these seats, that seems to take up more space, than on 737-800/900 ships, and then, the DirectTV controls are on the top of one of those bins. Rather odd. On this flight, the DirectTV worked well, for the entire flight. On too many other flights, DirectTV has not functioned well, but this time, it did.    Plus, this particular ship seemed to have seen a great deal of wear and tear. The seatback pocket at 2F had red fingernail polish in it, plus ball point pen marks. The seatback pocket was also worn, where it attached to the seat. In general, it was clean, but could use a bit of TLC.    Our Boarding went smoothly, and we pushed back about 6 mins late.. The weather at IAH was a mixed bag - rain, dense haze, some heavy broken clouds, and then, a ceiling of heavy clouds. We climbed quickly above those clouds, and did not see the ground, until near Phoenix. The weather cleared more, the closer we got to PHX, but we then had lots of smoke from several fires, and even more haze.    As this was a 2:39 hr flight, we had a “snack,” which had a choice of:  Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese - which is a good dish, IMHO, and translates well to being catered at 30,000'.  Mediterranean Chicken Salad - not quite as good, but better than some of the recent Thai.-style Salads.  Each came with a good Carrot Cheese Cake (better than many of the UA Cheese Cake offerings), and a good seed roll. The Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese came with a small mixed salad.  We each had the Gravelly Ford California Chardonnay ‘17, for our wine.    Even with the weather, and the climb out of IAH, it was mostly a smooth flight. The Cabin Crew was very good, as had been the Gate Agents at IAH (not always the case, in my experiences).    We were only a few minutes late into PHX, arriving at Gate 6B, one of the old Continental gates at Skyharbor, T2. Our luggage arrived rather quickly onto Carousel 4, and we were home! A good flight, and on a United plane, which was new to us, and with some oddities - but still a good flight."
May 2020,40,June - UA6249 Houston to Dallas ERJ-175 (#N8635O) FC Seats 2C & D,"June - UA6249 Houston to Dallas ERJ-175 (#N8635O) FC Seats 2C & D    This was our second flight of the morning of June 08, as we had connected just over an hour ago, from Phoenix. We flew UA6249 from Houston (IAH) to Dallas (DFW) on an ERJ-175 (#N8635O) operated by Mesa Airlines dba United Express, in First Class, Seats 2C & D.    We had arrived at IAH C-2, and had time to stop by the United Club, near our departure gate, C-31, on our layover. After a drink at the Club, we walked over to Gate C-31, and boarded before Group 1, due to our status. We took our seats on the starboard side of the plane, and near the front of First Class. The EMB-175 is configured 1-2 in First Class, with 4 rows of seats, then E and E+ are 2-2. One issue in FC is that the bins above the A seats, are tiny, but my small briefcase fits - though not much more than a medium-sized purse would. That means that all FC passengers, will mostly need the larger bins, above the C & D seats. Also, a bit of the forward bin space is used for safety equipment, at the front of the FC cabin. As those starboard bins are pretty generous, my wife’s wheeled briefcase fit easily. The EMB-175 has good underseat storage in FC, unlike several other Regional Jets in the UA fleet. Another aspect, which I like about this plane is that it has a closet, near the galley, unlike the CRJ-200/700's and the EMB-145's. As we always fly with our jackets, the closet is greatly appreciated.    With jackets hanging in the closet, we settled to our seats, for the short flight between IAH and DFW - listed at 1:18 hrs, but it took only about 00:55 of flight time. Though the boarding had gone quickly, there was no pre-departure drink, then basically a passed snack basket during the flight. A second consideration was that United Express only had the Camelot Chardonnay in FC, and that is just not a favorite of ours - though we have been known to drink it, on occasion. One thing new regarding the passed snacks, was the addition of Drizzilicious Cinnamon Swirls, which we had not seen before, but they were just OK. I opted for the Deep River Sea Salt Potato Chips, which we have had many times before.    This plane had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), which is streamed for free, to one’s device, but on the short 1:18 hr flight, neither of us used it. It also had WiFi, for a fee, but it went unused, as well. The WiFi is for a fee.    The flight was fairly smooth, with scattered clouds, and haze, and we arrived on-time at DFW, pulling into Gate E-8. Our luggage arrived quickly, and we were off to my wife’s meetings.    In all, a very short, pleasant flight, with nice cabin crew. Though many of the Gate Agents at IAH are not our favorite folk, all with whom we dealt, were great."
May 2020,40,June - UA6258 Dallas to Houston ERJ-175 (#N88359) FC Seats 2C & D,"June - UA6258 Dallas to Houston ERJ-175 (#N88359) FC Seats 2C & D    This was our first of two flights on June 11, as we were connecting at Houston (IAH), for our final leg, home to Phoenix. We flew UA6258 from Dallas (DFW) to Houston (IAH) on an ERJ-175 (#N88359) operated by Mesa Airlines dba United Express, in First Class, Seats 2C & D. We were scheduled to fly on an EMB-175 #N88335, but the plane was changed, as was our arrival gate at IAH.    We had arrived at DFW early, as the weather was looking bad, but had plenty of time, so we started our journey at the AMEX Centurion Lounge, over in the D Concourse, and rode the SkyLink to Concourse E, and our departure gate, E-7. We still had time, so grabbed two more glasses of wine at the new Flying Saucer Bar, right at out gate. This is one of the newer additions, and like most at United gates at many airports, uses a tablet for orders, which can be paid via credit card, or United MileagePlus points. Many similar bars have been added over the last few years.    When our flight was called, we boarded before Group 1, due to our status, and only a few minutes late. We took our seats on the starboard side of the plane, and near the front of First Class. The EMB-175 is configured 1-2 in First Class, with 4 rows of seats, then E and E+ are 2-2. One issue in FC is that the bins above the A seats, are tiny, but my small briefcase fits - though not much more than a medium-sized purse would.

Another aspect, which I like about this plane is that it has a closet, near the galley, unlike the CRJ-200/700's and the EMB-145's. As we always fly with our jackets, the closet is greatly appreciated, and was once again.    With jackets hanging in the closet, we settled to our seats, for the short flight between IAH and DFW - listed at 1:11 hrs, but it took only about 00:58 of flight time. Though the boarding had gone quickly, there was no pre-departure drink, then basically a passed snack basket during the flight. As we had enjoyed a couple glasses of wine in the Centurion Lounge, and at the Flying Saucer, we really did not want to even bother with the Camelot Chardonnay on the plane..    This plane had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), which is streamed for free, to one’s device, but on the short 1:18 hr flight, neither of us used it. It also had WiFi, for a fee, but it went unused, as well. The WiFi is for a fee.    We took off in rain, and had lots of haze, and a few broken clouds, down to Houston, where there was more rain waiting for us..    The Gate Agents at DFW were very good, and boarding was extremely orderly, even for a full plane. The Cabin Crew was excellent, and easily had completed the limited in-flight service, before preparation for landing - very efficient. A good flight, and we easily would make our connection at IAH, especially as we were arriving at Gate C-35 (changed from C-32), and connecting to another United flight departing from Gate C-15 (changed from C-12)."
May 2020,50,Excellent Customer Service for a flight cancellation,"This review is not for a flight that I travelled on, but for United's handling of a cancelled flight as a result of COVID.    United had to cancel the flight. They called my up themselves (without being prompted), to explain the flight had been cancelled, and if I wanted to rebook. I asked for a refund as I don't have a new plan yet, and they agreed. The call lasted less than a minute.    When I checked my account 30 mins later, the points have already been refunded, and the money is back in my account. And just to be clear, I currently have NO status with United...I'm not an elite member.    WELL DONE UNITED, for abiding by EU261 and providing refunds in this hassle free way. I wish other airlines would make it as easy as you did.    I would recommend United, just based on this customer experience."
May 2020,20,return trip,I have travelled domestically with United quite often and had been several years (about 6-7 years) since I flew United Internationally. This stretch was from Osaka to San Francisco. Ok service. Food served as fast as possible and found it difficult to sleep on what would have been an overnight flight as the flight attendants kept moving about the cabin and was bumping into things.
May 2020,50,Great flight!,"Fantastic crews, awesome foods, and comfortable seats! I strongly recommend this fight. The connecting time as well is not very long."
May 2020,40,Enjoyable Flight,"The flight was on time and was smooth. Quite hitch free. There was a last minute offer of benefits if I choose to change to a later flight in the day, which was tempting, but my trips are normally tight, so changing was not a welcome option.  The in-flight service was good."
May 2020,10,Terrible Customer Service,United will be the first airline to go under. Horrible customer service. I simply wanted a voucher for my FULL original ticket price due to United continuously changing my flights before departure and they refuse to give me my full voucher! I'm done with United. I'll stick with Southwest who will most likely come out of top after all this corona mess. Terrible service United. I couldn't be more disappointed.
May 2020,10,"Rude staff, bad unhealthy food",Worse service ever! I will never fly United again. United does not deserve the 5 billion dollars they got from the government to survive this travel ban due to coronavirus. United is heavy in debt. United deserves to go under. Let the better airlines have that business!
May 2020,10,"Awful servics, personnel and culture","I recently booked a flight to Cozumel the first part of July. The airlines cancelled routes and I attempted to book a flight when they resumed 2 weeks later, same flight, same day of the week, same time. Their cancellation caused a way higher hotel rate to begin with. UA wanted to charge another $300 per ticket, no exceptions, for their flight cancellation issue. Really?? I questioned it and was attacked by the well trained UA customer service Guru. Karma is waiting for these bottom feeders that have treated their best customers like crap over the last 15 years. I will use up my miles for free future flights but my days as a paying customer with UA are over. A shame, because Continental was such a great airline before the UA clowns destroyed them."
May 2020,10,Horrible,"Horrible customer service, had to file a dispute with credit card company. Hold times are hours and customer service reps are lost when you finally get hold of a human. By far the worst Airlines on the planet. Filled out proper paperwork online to get refund and was approved and still had to file a dispute with credit card company when flight was canceled due to boarder closings."
May 2020,10,They changed my purchased seats without notice,"I chose my and my husband's seats online and pay the extra fees for the extra legroom. I also got the email confirmation about this purchase on April 22nd. I just check my flights today (May 5th). I found out that they changed my seats to regular seat section which you do not need to pay extra fee and they also separated my husband and I. My original seat with my husband is in the same role and next to each other. I checked the seat map. The seats i originally purchased are still available, but they increase the price 3 times more. I call the customer service, they only said "" we go ahead refund you"". My point here is that they move my purchased seats without notice and any refund, only because they want to increase their seat selection price. United airline doesn't care about customers, they only care about money!!! WILL NOT DO UNITED AIRLINE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!"
May 2020,10,Border closed - united don’t care,I booked travel in January 2020 to fly from Montana to Florida. I live in British Columbia however flights out of Montana which is just across the border from where I live are usually more reasonable and more direct. Due to the unfortunate events that followed in the months to come regarding the Border closures between the United States and Canada I was unable to board this flight. I sent a refund request to United airlines in which I was denied because it was a nonrefundable ticket and the flight was not cancelled by United. They provided no exception to this as it was not their fault. My other family members that were Meeting us in Florida who also live in Canada but we’re flying out of Detroit through Delta in spirit airlines. Both of these airlines were accommodating to their non-refundable tickets due to the unforeseen circumstances. I will never recommend never fly United airlines again. Their customer service was very rude and accommodating and simply did not care they were following the rules.I did put in a complaint in with the department of transportation and hopefully to get a resolve.
May 2020,50,Solid flights too and from Miami,"The flight too Miami arrived earlier than scheduled, so that was great. The flight coming back was delayed by an hour or two, but it was fine."
May 2020,10,United is the worst airline company on earth,"Was in the Mexico City airport and that entire team gives you a spectacularly bad service. Horrific. Never fly United, even for free."
May 2020,50,Customer service,"I was flying from Chicago on flight 1857 to DC. When we boarded, an announcement was made that the plane's navigation screen was down. After four 10 minute delays, the plane was not in the air until an hour after the scheduled departure time. I asked the flight attendant if there was anything they could do because my next plane was scheduled to take off upon our arrival. She said they had already taken care of it and notified the airport to hold the next flight for 20 extra minutes so the four of us could make it! As we were approaching DC, the head flight attendant sat all of us in the first class, told us which gate to go to and made an announcement for the rest of the passengers to wait a few minutes until we got off. As a result, I made it to my next flight and was home at the planned time!  In conclusion, I am very impressed with their service, thankful to the flight crew, and thank the United Airlines team for their efforts! In my opinion, that's what defines integrity, professionalism, and outstanding customer service. Thank you, United Airlines!"
May 2020,40,United Refunds - for cancelled flights during Covid 2020,"United cancelled my flight for June 5, 2020, and when I called for a refund to my CC, I was informed, "" you can only receive a 2yr future flight credit!"" As I normally, only purchase tickets that have a full refund, I thought this was strange, but I did not have the receipt. I was told they would process the credit for a future credit flight, and that later I could submit a request for a full refund.    When I returned home and found my ticket receipt, I found it stated: ""refundable!"" I then call United and spoke to a different agent, and she informed me that, ""yes, my ticket was fully refundable to my CC, and she thought it strange that the previous agent had misinformed me!"" And it will take 30-days for it to appear on the CC.    In summary, if United cancels your flight, look at the receipt to make sure it is refundable, or is non-refundable.....before you call for a refund. If it is not refundable because they cancelled the flight...yo do not have to pay a $200 re-booking fee.    Good luck"
May 2020,10,no carry on,"Basic economy for United does not include a carry on bag. This is not told to you except in fine print. I had a round trip flight from Billings to Austin. Going to Austin I flew Delta and had a GREAT time. Delta is fantastic. On my way back to Billings I flew with United. I am told at the airport that the SAME ECONOMY seat I had on Delta, that had free carry on luggage, does not offer free carry on with UNITED. At the airport I am forced to spend $35 to check my bag that is small enough to carry on because I have a basic economy ticket. Everyone I spoke to at the airport about this was very rude and not accommodating whatsoever.  If United is going to charge people for a carry on then they should not be in the same category as Delta, American Airlines, ect. This should be considered a budget airline like Allegiant, if they are not going to offer basic amenities.  I hate this airline and go out of my way not to fly with them.  This is only one of many problems I've experienced with this less than average airline."
Apr 2020,10,Flights Cancelled--No Refund !,"We had booked through Expedia (don't deal with them) for a flight from PV to SFO and  then on to Vancouver, B.C. the same day. The flights were cancelled by United almost immediately after we booked them. I have been trying to get a refund for over a month now, with no success. I have called Expedia, who never advised United to give  us a refund ( very sleazy) and then United . I filled out United's refund form online and have never heard back from them. It is apparent that they have no intention of refunding our money. So, lesson learned--never deal with Expedia or United Airlines :"
Apr 2020,40,Good overall Experience,"Pretty satisfied with the experience. Boarding was quick, airline cabins were filled so they allowed us to checkin our carry ons and we did not have to wait very long at IAH to get the carryons back."
Apr 2020,50,Great Flight to Maui,"Been a frequent flyer with them for some time, always pleased and they take good care of their members. Generally even more friendly on the Maui flights, would recommend to anyone flying regularly."
Apr 2020,10,Worst service i have ever experienced.,"Flight to Colorado was delayed by 3 hours after already boarding the plane and on the tarmac, then once we landed in Colorado they canceled all flights back to phoenix and left us stranded there. Was forced to rent a car and 13 hours back home to make it there on time. They refused to reimburse us even though they canceled our flight and didnt even try to make it right and customer care laughed when I said I wanted my money back. Will never fly united again. This company is complete trash. I would walk back to colorado before flying with them again."
Apr 2020,10,Trashy company loves stealing from their customers.,"What an absolute joke this company is during a pandemic. They are so lucky they haven't had a lawsuit on their hands yet. They state on their website that there is no changing fee if you change your ticket before the 30th April 2020, trust me that is a lie.    I changed my Fiancé's ticket on the 17th of march, so that he could go back home sooner before New Zealand went into complete lockdown. The website said ""change fee:$0.00 Total payment: $83.50NZD"" which was for the difference between both tickets. After paying for the difference to change the ticket, I recieved a confirmation email confirming the paid amount of $83.50NZD. Immediately after, I received another email stating $186.60NZD had been taken from my account due to ""additional fees"" 😐. I called United Airlines and they told me to email the refund department, and it took them A MONTH to give me a ""refund declined"" conclusion with a completely irrelevant automated message. I then filed for the refund another 3 times to recieve, again, irrelevant automated responses with a ""refund declined"" conclusion. Recently a customer service representative finally emailed me to tell me that I agreed to pay $186.60NZD as a change fee 🤦‍♀️. When and where?! How can I agree to a change fee when it literally says on their website that is is waivered?! Literally nowhere did it say 186.60NZD until AFTER they charged my account, which is completely ILLEGAL! You can't charge a customer a large amount of money without their knowledge or consent. Unfortunately there are a lot of customers going through similar situations where UA are stealing their money, such a pitiful company. Please avoid them at all costs."
Apr 2020,50,Best costumer service,"I have flown a few times with United Airlines. Last fall there was a big snow storm coming my way and I had to change my flights last minute. When I called them, there was no wait time on the phone and the lovely lady gladly helped me and changed my flight free of charge. Again yesterday I had to cancel a flight I had booked for this summer. Again, no wait time at all on the phone and all my questions were answered. Highly recommens flying with United Airlines for their top notch costumer service."
Apr 2020,10,Premier platinum flier,"United is the one airline who is not refunding when they cancel a flight. Taking bailout money from customers then turning around and breaking consumer laws by not refunding when THEY cancel a flight. Shameful and won’t ever book a flight with them again, as a premier platinum member."
Apr 2020,40,Pleasant trip,"I chose United for a trip in early March. Flights were on time and trip itself was comfortable enough. I would definitely fly United again, they had the best travel time options from San Francisco."
Apr 2020,10,Horrendous Company,"You are truly an awful and shameful company. How dare you deny refunds to nurses during this pandemic. Disgusting! Never again. We called three times, for hours at a time. Today we called and waited 4 hours, with a canceled flight that you canceled, and you still wouldn't refund. Instead, you forced my wife to take credits we won't be able to use. And this is your mistake. She is in tears. Now she gets no vacation, no refund, and must go back to fighting this pandemic. SHAME ON YOU!"
Apr 2020,50,Started horrible but ended well!,"Many employees standing not helping and no suggestion that it took an hour to get to gate especially with train n waking n moving walks. We shouldn’t have presumed that old tram bus service was replaced. The problem 2 fold 1. If you don’t ask your screws and 2. Notice of how long it took to get to gate not posted on ticket or sign... Though TSA not responsible told we enough time like check in to eat lunch that no restrooms where at gate majorly incorrect. I did submit suggestion on line with no response. We did miss flight n customer service unable to help! Until mr sey who was in training was spotted into our overnight wait how come no other connecting cities were available. Like Miami, Tampa, or Orlando. God sent this to our aid within 10-15 we were on an electric assisted cart to a gate next ours down at the end. I called a head to thirsty car rental to pickup car n xfer at north fort Myers airport were our luggage would be. All worked despite car trip to fort Myers time wise and tired we got luggage n car was extended on contact. Well it gets better even we did find a place to buy in Naples with first 2 tries eventually it did work out! The return flight we were early 2 hrs like way out this time instruction was clear and sat at table with pilot who heard our story. He was impressed and stated suggestions like would make company better. He said he would see us at gate. Thank you’s were exchanged and we did meet him at the gate. We thought it was insure all boarded went well. He surprised us with priority boarding pass, a box of rum cake, and his card again thanking us for our patience. Wow what a way to finish. He did see if got off safely too. This time I ordered a wheel chair for us to help on the way hopefully it would end same as it began. It didn’t ty!!!"
Apr 2020,10,Thieves,"They STOLE $600 from me! Booked directly through United instead of a third party website in good faith because I wanted a legit, refundable ticket. As a result the agent overcharged my credit card over $600 the price she quoted after confirming that price included taxes, fees, and the booking fee for both travelers. Requested multiple times they listen to the recording of the call - in which they never did. I had my travel companion with me when I booked who was witness to the entire transaction and took detailed notes. What's worse is the agent never sent me an email confirmation so I had to find out from my credit card statement about the overcharge. In my first attempt to resolve the matter I was directed to the online Customer Care and they NEVER, over a month and a half later, have replied. And I received the auto reply they got my email. I called again, to no avail. They completely refused to take responsibility for their agents, never even investigated or responded to the issue, and refused to give me their supervisor's information so I could escalate the issue further. In my experience, the agents are poorly trained, dishonest, thieves, and do not care about their clients. It's obvious their first priority is money. I'm a little bit in shock right now that they think any of this would be acceptable. I'm contemplating never booking with them again."
Apr 2020,10,redefinition of 'significant delay',"United did not yet cancel the flights, but started to provide alternative flights that are using a redefinition of 'significant delay' so that I could not request a refund. If I accept this new window, and it changes again, then the hourly adjustment window starts at zero again. United also removed visibility of the first leg of the flight from my account on their web site, which makes it appear that I have NO outgoing flight and ONLY a returning flight. The next day United offered waivers which must be used by July 29 2021, ALL THE WHILE sitting on my federal tax C19 bailout money - this is infuriating. So in effect they have ALL of my original ticket money, they have obfuscated the original flight out by dropping the initial flight and proposing a new flight which is not noted as pending acceptance on their web site under my account, they are refusing my cancellation of any of the flights unless a $400 fee is forfeited, and they have money from me via the federal government that covers my initial $2,000 ticket prices. I am extremely upset by this. In addition, I have to work through a third-party agency that I purchased the tickets through (Fareboom), and I believe that while the third-party ticketing agency is attempting to provide the most accurate information as of the current day, that ticketing agencies such as this are harmed to a large degree by what United is doing, by association."
Apr 2020,50,Watch out for AIG Travel Insurance COV-19 retroactive exclusion,"United is treating customers very very well as regards cancellation. No penalties and full credit for future travel. Thank you, United. But...AIG travel insurance is another matter. On February 2 I purchased a payment-upfront hotel room for my July trip to San Francisco from Travelocity, and the same day bought travel insurance for the hotel ($9 to insure a $500/night room.. As my home state governor is now expecting to lock down senior citizens (like me) into ""June and maybe beyond,"" I checked on the status of my hotel insurance. What a shock to find that AIG states on line that any policy purchased after January 24 will not pay off if travel is cancelled because of COV-19, saving that somewhere somehow somebody declared Cov-19 to exist on January 24, so they're not paying. That's like saying that a travel policy for Caribbean trave in Septemberl purchased after June 1 (start of the official Hurricane season) will not be honored if travel is affected by a hurricane because you knowingly bought the insurance after the start of Hurricane season. Needless to say, when I purchased on February 2 there was no indication of any kind that COV-19 would be a non-covered problem. I can't wait for the class action suit. In the meantime, I will not do business with AIG in the future."
Apr 2020,10,United has no values,"Since United reservations wouldn't help and have screwed things so bad after 2 cancelled flights, I am dealing with customer service wasting my and their time. I will be getting refunds on my May 5th cancelled business class flight and my May 18 economy flight that United reservations wouldn't book. It will take 7 to 10 days but they can take your money the same day. The kicker is they will not honor their original price and have put their rates up over twice as much. That is like me selling a car but putting up the price twice before you get it. Not impressed. You will economy is available but they were pushing economy plus 1 way at $2871. Unbelievable in troubled times when my personal expenses have sunstantual ly increased as I have been in Colombia since March 1st with a return date of Match 18th. Now leaving May 18th. Unbelievable!"
Apr 2020,10,United horrible customer service and no dignity.,Refuses to refund my money in a time where they should be. Said there weren't more than 6 hours of changes...We cant leave our homes!! I will never fly united again!! Worst customer service i have ever experienced. Get with the program United. Had zero problems getting a refund with delta or american airlines.
Apr 2020,10,Awful customer service during this pandemic,"Terrible customer service from top to bottom. In a time where people are losing their jobs, United is holding refunds at ransom. When you try to call Customer service, you first have to wait on the phone for 2-3 hours at a time. When you finally get someone, the chance of speaking with someone who has half an idea of what’s going on is very slim. Then they proceed to give you the run around on when your refund will be given back to you. For example, I was initially told 2-3 weeks from when I filed for it on 3/18. Then I was told well it’s 2 more weeks because of the pandemic, which I understand. Then they tell me, it’ll actually be 30-90 days. Are they out of their mind? I’ve asked for refunds from other companies, and they’ve been able to refund it within the same week. United is just kicking the can down the road with everyone’s refund money until the government bails them out. I will never book with united again, nor will I ever recommend them."
Apr 2020,10,No Refund for Canceled Flight,United canceled my flight for June-8 and REFUSES to refund my money. I thought federal law states they must refund when they cancel a flight.
Apr 2020,10,Follow up for return flight,"So now that the itinary was sent with 2 flights missing and no connection from Houston to Calgary after paying $361.30 because I was forced onto business class, I tried to book a return flight for May 18 with reservations. I had to find the flight because the agent was useless. They wouldn't book me on economy and were forcing into a 1 way ticket economy flex at over $2800. When I have already paid for a return flight. Since economy existed, I had to book it on the internet and write a complaint. United will be reversing the $1090 plus dollars in 7 to 10 days but did not address the $361.30 for the business class ticket since I am now flying economy again on my original ticket. They did not read the 4 emails and evidence. So now I had to issue another complaint. This has caused me time and money in a very stressful time of coronavirus when I tried to prospone my trip in the first place. United changed their policy a few days after my trip."
Apr 2020,10,Horrible service,I tried to change my flight before my March 1st departure because of being high risk for the corona virus with no success. 3 days later their policy changed. Now I am in Medellin and and wanted to change to reconfirm my flight for March 26 but according to United Airlines your not suppose to contact UA until 72 hours before. Air space was being closed and now I can't get out. Thank you United for horrible service and now I have to pay a premium to get out May 5th. An additional $361.30. Flight May 5th was canceled again and United automatic rebooking was missing 2 connections so I would have been stranded. Call United reservation who were absolutely useless. I had to find my flight because the reservation. Agent was useless. Then she would not book me economy return but was pushing a one way ticket with a high service level for $2871 when economy existed and I pointed her to United'S web page but she still didn't do her job. She forced me to book a one way economy ticket for $1090.70. So I issued a complaint to United who only looked at the first email and not all 4. So they are re recrediting my visa for the flight but still not addressing the $361.30 for the business flight that I had no choice for May 5th return. There is nothing worse than a person who can't do their job and ripping you off. So I had to issue another comaint telling United that they didn't look at all the information and they still owe me $361.30 for the May 5th flight they cancelled and the economy rate should be honored on the original ticket price. Also under the new rules in the US they are suppose to provide a prompt refund and 7 to 10 is not prompt. I could provide evidence but your service doesn't support screen shots.original confirmation number PSTL33.
Apr 2020,50,Manchester to Newark return economy.,"We had not flown for three years so we were unsure on how the trip would go. we stayed local the night before so we were up, ready and at the airport for 6 o'clock for our Feb 24th 9 o'clock flight. a lot of things had changed !, it all slotted into place and we flew through United's booking in ( mostly due to booking in online and printing off our boarding passes 24 hours before ). we arrived at the gate with plenty of time to spare but were told that the flight was delayed due to a crash on the M56 and the cabin crew were stuck in it. ( I'm glad we came the night before or else we would have been in the traffic panicking ), We were only delayed a small time so it was not a problem at all, plus we were given regular updates about the situation. the flight itself was excellent, the last time we flew the seating was 3 + 3, this time it was 2 + 3 + 2 so it made the flight so much better.the seating was Economy but comfy even for an 8 hour flight, the cabin crew were ( as always ) excellent, regular drink runs and smiling faces, very polite. Good films / TV shows, travel updates and good food made the flight fast and entertaining..... On the return trip ( March 1st ) we had a three hour delay due to a fault on the aircraft, the brake pads on one wheel needed replacing. to me this seemed very reasonable, a small delay to make safe the aircraft, but even though the cabin crew kept us up to date on repair times and made sure we had water and snacks on tap there were quite a few people that were not happy, i understand the frustrations of travelers with young children though, I was just happy for the aircraft to be safe. United did everything they could, from trying to find another plane to keeping us all updated. the chilled out passengers like myself kept entertained by watching the work on the plane through the departure lounge window. when we got underway is was back to normal with the great service, a nice sleep and good food and lots of updates. Who knows when air travel will get back to normal but i look forward to my next United flight."
Apr 2020,10,THE WORST AIRLINES WITH THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"This is absolutely unacceptable. I have lied to be a supervisor at United, I have been hung up on by a Supervisor at United, and I have not received my refund of $2,900.00 even though it was promised to me. Julie Clogrove and Hal from the Refund Department provided me with the absolute WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I was calm and kinds through all my communication to United. I spend over 7 hours on the phone only to be transferred to Hal (a supervisor from the Refund Department) so that he could say one sentence to me and hang up immediately while I was still responding to him."
Apr 2020,50,Charleston to Norway,I must say. This was an enjoyable transatlantic flight. Plane was clean. Staff were more than curious. I will make the flight again no problem
Apr 2020,10,Claims of COVID Assistance Only on the Surface - Charged $125 to Deposit Award Miles,"I had ticket using award miles 4/7 with UA. When WA ordered shelter in place I cancelled my ticket. UA had a COVID policy posted allowing cancellation and stated they would re-deposit my miles. This week I found the UA charged me $125 to redeposit the miles. This wasn’t clear at the time of cancellation. I didn’t enter a credit card to authorize the charge. They used a card on file. I reached out to UA and was told they wouldn’t refund the charge because they weren’t waiving charges at that time. They said I would have to buy a future ticket and they would allow me to use the amount as a credit. Now UA will only give a $125 credit on future flight. Obviously they are trying to make additional money off the national crisis bad. The day after I was refused a refund on the redeposit fee I received a form letter via email from the VP of customer service for UA touting the fact that they aren’t charging redeposit fees. Again I reached out and was denied a refund. I’ve also tried to contact UA via social media including a message to the VP that sent the letter. So far no channel of contact either from phone calls to customer service nor indirect via social media has worked. A side note, I also had an award ticket to MSY on Alaska Air. I cancelled my AS ticket at the same time and want charged a re-deposit fee in accordance to the AS posted COVID policy."
Apr 2020,30,May - UA4327 Knoxville to Houston EMB-145 (#N15574) Seats 18C & D,"May - UA4327 Knoxville to Houston EMB-145 (#N15574) Seats 18C & D    On May 23, we flew United Airlines UA4327, on an EMB-145 (#N15574) from Knoxville (TYS) to Houston (IAH), to connect with our flight home to PHX. This plane was operated by Expressjet Airlines, dba United Express. We had seats 18C & D, which are Exit Row seats. On the EMB-145, space is really at a premium, and the few extra inches of pitch, plus the necessary underseat storage, is appreciated.    We had stayed at the Hilton TYS, the night before, after a wonderful stay at Blackberry Farm. In the TYS terminal, we checked our luggage, from a week of business and pleasure, and when I handed one case to the UA agent, she pointed out that it was 0.8 lbs over the weight of 50 lbs. I showed her that we were Global Services, and at all levels from 1K, the allowance was a whopping 70 lbs. She had never heard of that, and complained that I would have to move about 1 lb from that case, to another. Her co-worker verified that we got 70 lbs, and our agent walked a way for a bit. When she returned, she told us that she had no idea how to do that, as she had a limit of 50 lbs for all. Her co-worker had her change positions, and had the luggage checked in moments - just putting a red and white “Heavy” label on that one case. This was the first UA agent, with whom I have had any issues, and with 100's of flights per year, on UA. Someone may have missed a day of training?    With the luggage checked, just past TSA Security, we stopped into Ruby Tuesday, for wine, as we had just had a nice breakfast at our hotel. On the way to Gate 11 (flight still showing “On Time”), we took in an art exhibit, and a small gem show - very nice diversions in TYS Airport.    The United App alerted us, that our plane would be late - but monitor still showing On Time, so my wife visited the Starbucks, down the short concourse.    Our plane (coming in from Newark (EWR) arrived almost an hour late, but the turn-around was quick, and we were on our way - only about 50 late now. Our connection at IAH was getting tight.    Boarding before Group 1 has advantages, and one needs those on an EMB-145, as there are overhead bins only on the starboard side of the plane - no bins on the port side, at all, so everyone has to use those above the C & D seats. Now, the EMB-145 is configured 1-2, for the entire cabin. The aisle is also about 2' lower, than the level that the seats are on, so a “step-up.” Add in that the overhead bins (and air duct on the port side) hang low, one is very likely to bump their head, getting into, or out of the seat. We fly EMB-145's too often, and I still hit my head, about every other flight.    Because of the small fuselage, the curvature cuts into legroom from the side, on the A and D seats. In our case, my petite wife probably should have been in 18D, but I was hoping to get some photographs, especially on departure from TYS. Two issues, however, are that the window has a largish “Exit Row Seats” sticker, and then one is over the wing, these being over-wing exits, so shooting from these seats will always be difficult. Think I will let my wife have the window seats next time? Also, the shade in the Exit door, is only partial, on most of the EMB-145's, due to the mechanics of the door - not sure why not on all? This one was partial, but I planned on having it open. Also, on some EMB-145's, the shade cannot retract 100%, so the view will be partially obscured. This was not one of those ships, and the shade DID retract into its frame..    If there is a bright spot on the EMB-145's, it is that on the starboard (C & D) side, there are only two braces for the seats in front, so the width of the underseat storage is a bit wider, than on some larger planes. OK, that is the only bright side. Note that the distance from the floor, to the seat bottom in front of you, is much less, than on a larger plane. Also, the limited overhead bins are shallow, and their opening not very large - not much will fit. Note that unlike on many types of aircraft, the overhead bin doors drop down, and do not lift up. This fools many, who are not used to these ships. My wife’s small, wheeled briefcase will not fit in the overhead bin, because it is about ½"" too thick, but will fit under the seat - but just barely. My small briefcase will fit in the overhead bins, with just barely enough room to fold my blazer, and place it atop the briefcase.    On this flight, there was one passing of the beverage cart, down the very narrow aisle. With our status, we would have gotten wine/alcohol at no charge, and we went with the Camelot California Chardonnay, and the Redwood Vineyards California Cabernet Sauvignon - for being served in plastic cups, not the worst wines we have had.    We had taken off into significant haze (not uncommon in the Smoky Mountains), and were in clouds for most of the flight down to Houston, but at least it was a smooth flight. Near IAD, the weather was changing, the clouds were heavy, just about until we broke through for final.    We were going to have a tight connection, due to being late, and here we were stuck in Row 18! We landed at B-22, in one of the two commuter terminals at IAH, and had to get to E-14. I was hoping to see a Global Services agent waiting for us, to get us across the airport on the tarmac.    In all, except for being late, the flight was good. Unlike on so many United flights, the ticket agent was not what I have come to expect. The flight attendant was very good, and quite friendly. A decent flight - but now we likely had issues with our connection home?"
Apr 2020,40,May - UA604 Phoenix to Denver A319 (#4896) FC Seats 2A & B,"May - UA604 Phoenix to Denver A319 (#4896) FC Seats 2A & B    On Thursday, May 16, we flew United Airlines UA604, from Phoenix (PHX) to Denver (DEN) in First Class, Seats 2A & B on an A319 (#4896). We had been scheduled to fly on A319 #4028, but that ship was swapped out. This was the first leg of a multi-state trip, that was part business, and part leisure. On this day, we were connecting at Denver, for onward travel to Omaha, for a Creighton Medical School event and board meeting. Later, we would fly to Chicago, then to Knoxville and finally Houston, before returning home to Phoenix.    We started the morning at the little United Club at PHX, with a glass of Champagne, and then walked down to Gate 6A in T2. Our departure had been moved from Gate 7, immediately across from the UA Club, but really only a few extra steps away. Gate 6A is one of the old Continental Airlines gates, and is really 3 gates in one small area: Gates 6A & B, plus Gate 8. Since United had gone to the new 2-lane boarding scheme, the crowding in this area has been greatly reduced, but real estate is still a bit tight.    We boarded on-time, and were in our seats, with two glasses of the Ca’ Di Rajo Mitō sparking wine. Our seats were in the rear of First Class, and on the port side of the plane. On the A319/320 ships, the last row of FC (Row 3 on the A320) is against a bulkhead, and there are clothes hangers. As this was just behind me, I had my, and my wife’s jackets hanging. We settled in, for the relatively short flight up to Denver, for our connection to Omaha.    This A319 had the updated FC seats, which I now believe have been installed in all UA Airbus ships. In FC, there is a podium, between the 2-2 configured seats, with small drink trays, several storage areas (not for use in takeoff, or landing), and AC/USB and earphone plugs. The podium has nice marble tops. The seats are comfortable, with both good width, and ample legroom, and their recline is quite nice, plus as the rear reclines, the seat cushion slides forward, so these intrude much less on those behind a reclined seat - they take a little getting used to, as one needs to slide their hips forward, to recline. Now, the A319 only has 2 rows of FC, and though the overhead bins are adequate, the first one and a half on the starboard side of the plane are filled with safety gear, however my wife’s small wheeled briefcase fit nicely, and then my regular briefcase and hat fit below Row 1 seats, along with my wife’s purse.    We had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) streamed to our devices via the United App, but did not use this free service on this short flight. There was on-board WiFi, for a fee, but again, we did not use it.    We took off with some haze and high clouds, flew into more clouds, but I managed to get a nice view of Meteor Crater in the Painted Desert, and then a few brief glimpses of snow on the Rockies, before we landed in heavier haze at DEN - however, the weather was building, so glad that the layover was not too long.    In-flight, I moved to the Gravelly Ford CA Chardonnay, and wife to coffee. We had a warmed muffin, which was nice - probably went better with the coffee, than the Chard.    The flight was relatively smooth - or as smooth as any flight between PHX and DEN can be. The flight was almost, if not completely 100% full. I had looked at the seating chart before boarding began, and there were only 3 middle-row E+ seats available, with about 9 people on the stand-by list. On a few previous UA flights, there were more empty seats, than I am used to, but could be the time-of-day, that those flights were going out?    The cabin crew was great, as had been the gate agents at PHX. We landed on-time, so made our way to the United Club West, as it was closer to our departure gate, B-27 (the gate at which we had arrived) - though that was moved to B-12. Then, off to Omaha for the meetings.    In all, a very good flight, with no complaints."
Apr 2020,40,May - UA316 Phoenix to Washington/Dulles 737-800W (#3240) FC Seats 1A & B,"May - UA316 Phoenix to Washington/Dulles 737-800W (#3240) FC Seats 1A & B    We flew United Airlines UA316 from PHX to ORD on a 737-900 (#3840) in First Class, seats 1A & B (left, or port side) on May 06. This was a business trip, for 3 days of meetings in Washington, DC. This particular plane had arrived at PHX from LAX, the night before, so was already at the gate, Gate 8.    We began the morning (8:45am departure) at the United Club, near Gate 7 in Terminal T2 at PHX, as per our usual routine. Gate 6A & B and 8, share the same general area at PHX T2. Those are the old Continental gates, and it can get a bit crowded, especially if two, or more flights are departing around the same time. Some months ago, United changed their boarding lanes, and we now see the new, 2-lane configuration, at all gates, in all airports. For a crowded gate area, such as Gate 8, this really helps things, and folk were already lined up for Groups 1 and 2, when we arrived from the UA Club..    We boarded on-time, and as we board before the 1K and Group 1 passengers, were quickly into our seats, and ordered sparkling wine, for the pre-departure beverage. This was also a “breakfast flight,” so a little bit of sparkling wine seemed the way to go.    Boarding was completed quickly, and we pushed back from the gate on-time. This flight only had 9 available seats - 7 in Economy+ and 2 in Economy. Looking at the waitlist, I think that it went out 100% full, and a few passengers might have been upgraded to the E+ seats?    This 737-800W was one of the older 738's, with the smaller overhead bins - the newer 738's and 739's have an expanded overhead bin, which offers quite a bit more room. As we were in Row 1, we had to store everything in the overhead for takeoff and landing, as there is no underseat storage. We were glad to have been able to board just after the passengers needing special assistance or time, as we each had a briefcase, to go into the overhead, but both fit very easily - even my wife’s fairly small wheeled-briefcase. Now, Row 1 is just behind the bulkhead, and is not our first choice, but we were too late in getting our tickets, to get our usual Rows 2, or 3 seats. The bulkhead has a notch, in front of the B (and E) seat, providing a few more inches of foot room. Even though I am taller, than my wife, I chose the A seat, to be at the window. I still had adequate foot room, even without that cutout. Also, Row 1 has rigid magazine holders (Hemispheres, Safety Card, etc) attached to the bulkhead. Even at my height, that did not affect my knee room.    We took off into a fairly significant haze, so my choice of the window seat, vs the aisle seat was not rewarded - should have gone for aisle, for those 3 extra inches of foot room! As we fly this route often, I had hoped for some good views and photos of the Painted Desert, Meteor Crater, and some interesting country below us, but the haze precluded those views. Now, one neat thing, which I did see was an American Airline A319 with the old Allegheny Airlines livery, as it took off, just before we did, on Runway 25L, and behind an AA 757 - a blast from the past!    This ship had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) delivering streaming media via one’s device, and the United App. This was free, and worked well. It was also equipped with WiFi (for a fee), but neither of us used that, so I cannot comment on how well it worked.    As this was the “breakfast flight,” we had our choice between:  An Egg Sandwich on Ciabatta Bread - think UA’s version of Egg McMuffin, but oblong, instead of round - surprisingly not bad  Cold Oatmeal with Mango - a dish we have had before, and again not bad.  Both came with the Chobani Yogurt (blueberry), a small fruit bowl, and one’s choice of bread.    I moved over to the Chardonnay, which was the Gravelly Ford California 2017, and a fairly new addition to the wine lineup, while my wife switched over to coffee, since she had a meeting upon arrival in DC.    Later, I decided to try the red wine, and it was a new one to me, Château Villotte ‘16, a Bordeaux Blend, and not bad.    We finally got ahead of the haze, and had broken clouds into IAD.    We landed on-time, and pulled into Gate D24, were onto the mobile lounge (those always remind me of the “Sand Walkers” from Star Wars), and off to Baggage Claim, and Carousel 4. We find IAD to be rather slow with baggage delivery, but all of our luggage arrived pretty quickly, and we were off to downtown DC.    The flight was very nice, the food pretty good, and the UA service, from the Gate Agents at PHX, to the Cabin Crew on our flight, were all excellent. The seat comfort, and legroom were very good, even with that bulkhead, and everything on our flight worked well. And besides, I got to try a new red wine on United!"
Apr 2020,30,May - UA4839 Chicago to Knoxville CRJ-200 (#N428AW) Seats 1A & B,"May - UA4839 Chicago to Knoxville CRJ-200 (#N428AW) Seats 1A & B    On Saturday, May 18, we flew United Airlines flight UA4839, from Chicago O’Hare (ORD), to Knoxville McGhee Tyson (TYS), on a CRJ-200 (called a CL-65 on the safety card), N428AW (was supposed to be N439AW), operated by Wisconsin Airlines, dba United Express, in seats 1A & B. Normally, when flying a UAX CRJ-200, or EMB-145, we get Exit Row seats, but as Chicago was added to a multi-state trip, we had to scramble to change flights, and took what we could get. Also, we dislike flying in the first row, as foot room is usually limited by the bulkhead, and there is no underseat storage space - but we had no choice here.    We stopped into the United Club on the F Concourse at T1 ORD. We had just discovered this UA Club, a trip, or two back, and find it nice, and so far, never crowded.    We were slated to depart from Gate F12, which was changed to F11, and then to F7 - but in the F Concourse, gates are close, so no issue, and the great United App kept us updated on those changes.    Our flight was due to board 8:45am, and they were pretty much on-time. We were glad to be boarding, prior to Group 1 (due to our status), as the overhead storage is very limited on the CRJ-200, in Row 1, everything MUST go into the overhead bins, and then up front on the CRJ-200, some of that bin real estate is taken up by safety equipment. Also, the CRJ-200 does not have a closet, so my hat, and my jacket, went into my lap.    Also, the seats on the CRJ-200 are narrow at a mere 17"", and most have a limited pitch of 31"". I did not measure the pitch in Row 1, but would suspect that due to the bulkhead, it’s closer to 29"". The Exit Row seats have an adequate 34"" of pitch. Also, being so far forward, the fuselage is tapering, and both the shoulder room, plus the foot space on the left of 1A is reduced. I should have let my petite wife have 1A, but hoped to get some nice views into TYS, over the Tennessee Mountains.    We took off with haze and clouds, and quickly hit a rain storm, then into dense clouds, until just outside of TYS.    The United staff, from the Gate Agents at ORD, the folk in the United Club in F, to the Cabin Crew, were all great. Other than the discomfort of the CRJ-200, the flight was very good. In the near future, UAX plans to offer a new CRJ, the 550, on this route, with better seating, larger overhead bins, and a First Class cabin. I look forward to flying that new plane, when it’s put into service, and replaces many of the CRJ-200's and EMB-145's - two ships that I just do not like flying."
Apr 2020,10,"Nickel and Dime, Even in the Middle of a Pandemic","Wish I could give 0 stars. I would like to begin by saying that I am extremely disappointed in the service that your travel company United Vacations has provided me with. After receiving no communication from UV in March, I contacted your company directly to ask about your cancellation policies, since the Amresort that I booked with you (Dreams in Puerto Vallarta) contacted me personally to inform me that they would be closed until June. My trip was scheduled for May. Why did UV not provide me with this information? I could have paid the full $3000 for this trip and would have been stuck in Puerto Vallarta (if I made it across the border) with no place to stay. I was not happy to know that I would still be penalized $200 a person unless I changed my travel date by December 2020. So I was expected to still go on a trip where the Mexican border was closed, the resort area and tourism is closed, and the government has a travel ban. Most travel companies are allowing change until December 2021. Even after asking if I could have some documentation for my own records, showing that I have that credit to transfer to a new trip, I was denied that courtesy. I decided to cancel my trip and lose the $400. I hope that you make good use of it. I currently work in the travel industry myself and wanted to give UV a try. I will never do business with UV again. I hope you learn how to treat your future clients more humanely, especially in the middle of a pandemic."
Apr 2020,40,May - UA373 Chicago O’Hare to Phoenix 737-800 (#3526) FC Seats 2E & F,"May - UA373 Chicago O’Hare to Phoenix 737-800 (#3526) FC Seats 2E & F    After a 3:49 layover at O’Hare (we arrived from Washington/Dulles that morning), on May 09, we flew home to Phoenix, on UA373, on a 737-800SFP (#3526), in First Class, Seats 2E & F. The weather was poor, when we landed, with a blanket of thick, dark clouds, and it was not getting better, but we would likely get out, and pretty much on-time.    We had spent our layover at both the United Club, near our gate, B-7, and also the wine bar, Beaudevin.    We made our way between Concourse C, where we had landed at Gate C-9, and the B Concourse, via the illuminated tunnel. Though it has several moving sidewalks, we chose to just walk. I think I have probably used this tunnel over 50 times, and I still find it amazing. The colored trans-illuminated panels, the stainless steel and then the neon elements overhead, are lovely. On this walk, it seemed that all of the neon was working, but we have seen many segments out, and not that long ago. Many years ago, I was photographing the then new Concourse at the old Stapleton Denver Airport, for the lighting design firm. My art director kept saying that he wanted me to make this concourse look like the tunnel between B & C at ORD. My thought was “well, why did you not put in a neon art installation... ?” Still, I did the best I could, with the lighting provided at Stapleton - it was NOT the ORD tunnel, by any stretch.    Unlike a few recent UA flights (PHX-ORD, and PHX-IAD), this flight was nearly full, and there were only 9 seats available, with 20 mins to boarding, and all in E+. With about 12 people on the stand-by list, I assume that some MileagePlus passengers got upgraded?    We boarded on time, and our jackets and overcoats were stored in the little closet across from the galley, and we were settled in for our flight home. Boarding had been fine at B-7, which is a bit small, compared to several other of the B Gates, from which we have flown recently.    On the taxiway, I got to see the United “50 Years of Special Olympics” livery, on a 737-900 - nice!    We took off in rain, and were very quickly into the clouds, which persisted almost all of the way into PHX. Not much to see down below.    This was one of the older 737-800's, and from the United side of the fleet, so it did not have the seat-back DirectTV found on the ships from the Continental side of the merger. This meant that it had Personal Device Entertainment (PDE), with streaming content delivered to one’s device via the United App. This service is free, and worked fine - but we had flown so much, that I had already watched every movie of interest. It had WiFi (for a fee), but we did not use that on this flight. It also had the smaller overhead bins, but those were more than adequate for my wife’s small, rolling briefcase. My regular briefcase fit easily under the seat in front of me, as did my hat, and my wife’s purse.    First Class is configured 2-2 on these 737's, and with the seat supports, there are basically 3 underseat spaces.    Unlike on a few recent UA flights, we did get the warmed mixed nuts, just after takeoff. On two previous ORD-PHX flights, plus one PHX-ORD, we had not..    As this was the “lunch,” we were treated to:  A Salad w/ Chicken - pretty good, and better than some of the Thai-inspired Chicken dishes, which we have encountered lately  Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese - this is really a tasty dish, and one which we have enjoyed a few times  Both came with a Ginger Carrot Cake, which was much better than all of the recent Cheesecake variations we have had - note to UA: keep this one around, and same for that Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese. We also had the Château Villotte ‘16, a Bordeaux Blend, which we had experienced on our PHX-IAD flight, a few days earlier - not bad at 30,000 feet.    We did a bit of a fly-by, near PHX, to approach on Runway 28L, from the west, so from our starboard seats, got to see some of the “industrial” West Phoenix area.    We arrived, under cloudy skies at PHX on-time, and our luggage was out fairly quickly onto Carousel 4 in T2. We were headed home, in time to repack for more flights.    The Gate Agents at ORD were very good, as was the entire Cabin Crew - two of whom we recognized from prior flights. In all, a very good flight, and even with the longish connection at ORD, not a bad morning - though rather a long route, IAD-ORD-PHX, to get home, but this was the best schedule we could come up with, and got us home 5 hrs earlier, than other options did.."
Apr 2020,40,May - UA365 Houston to Phoenix 737-800 (#3276) FC Seats 2A & B,"May - UA365 Houston to Phoenix 737-800 (#3276) FC Seats 2A & B    On Thursday, May 23, we flew home to Phoenix (PHX) from Houston (IAH), where we had earlier connected from Knoxville (TYS), on UA365, on a 737-800 (#3276), in First Class, seats 2 A & B.    We had arrived at Gate B22, so had to traverse the airport, to get to our departure gate, E-14, and part of that via the efficient SkyTrain. We were glad that all went well, because we had a marginally tight connection at IAH to begin with, and with our TYS-IAH flight late, we had to really hurry, to make it. Often, we have a Global Services rep meet us at the jetbridge, and whisk us across the tarmac, under such situations. No rep! We have found that Houston’s Global Services staff is not as good, as say SFO, LAX, EWR, LHR, IAD or ORD. Not sure what the issue is. At least a Global Services rep did come onto the plane, to make sure we had made it, and to “thank” us for the millions of miles we both fly on United - nice, but a tad late.    We had rushed to make this connection, and Global Services had already been called, so we just ran to the podium, and were on-board. Time for some pre-departure wine! Luckily, they were pouring the Gravelly Ford Chard.    Our jackets (now rather sweaty) were hung in the closet near the galley, our two briefcases stored.    This 737-800, was from the Continental side of the fleet, and had the older cabin, and smaller overhead bins, but wife’s wheeled briefcase fit nicely. My briefcase fit under the seat in front, but had to go in the middle section, as the IFE (DirectTV) equipment took up quite a bit of that underseat real estate.    Our Boarding went smoothly, and we pushed back about. The weather at IAH was a mixed bag - dense haze, some heavy broken clouds, and threats of rain. We climbed quickly above those clouds, and did not see the ground, until about El Paso. The weather cleared more, the closer we got to Phoenix.    About 40 mins. into the flight, we had a “Snack.” This meal was a choice of either Moroccan Chicken w/ couscous, and hummus, or a Cheese, Meat, Nut & Fruit Tray. Both were pretty good, as far as airline food goes, though the Cheese Tray was the more visually appealing.    We got one each of the Gravelly Ford California Chardonnay ‘17, and the Château Villotte Bordeaux blend ‘16. Both were quite good, and especially with the Cheese Plate. We had begun encountering these two wines, a few months back, and compared to some recent options, find these two better than most.    Now, being from the Continental side of the fleet, via the merger some years back, we had DirectTV. As mentioned that equipment does take up a fair amount of the underseat storage. Over many flights on the sCO 737's, we have had mixed results with DirectTV. On this flight, at seat 2A, I could only get one Disney movie, and all of the other channels, including the Map, and the TV channels, did not work?? My wife had better luck in 2B, as she got several different movies, but no TV channels.    This plane, while in good shape, was starting to show some wear and tear, but was clean    Other than a bit of roughness out of IAH, and then the expected thermals, heading into PHX, the flight was smooth. Coming into PHX, we did a bit of a “fly-by,” heading to the west, before turning to land on Runway 25L.    Our cabin crew was very friendly, and efficient, and our landing at PHX was perfect. We were at Gate 6B, in T2, on schedule, and our luggage arrived in a fairly timely fashion onto Carousel 4, which is typical. After a multi-state combo business and leisure trip, we were home, in time to pack for our flight, two days later."
Apr 2020,40,May - UA374 Washington/Dulles to Chicago O’Hare 737-900 FC Seats 4E & F,"May - UA374 Washington/Dulles to Chicago O’Hare 737-900 FC Seats 4E & F    In May, we flew United Airlines UA374 between Washington/Dulles to Chicago O’Hare on a 737-900 (#3811) in First Class, Seats 4E & F.    After a short trip to The Hill, on May 09, we were back to Washington/Dulles Airport (IAD), to fly home to Phoenix, but via Chicago O’Hare (ORD). We had moved from downtown DC, out to the Hilton O’Hare Airport hotel, and as the weather was turning bad, were glad that we had done so. We only had a short shuttle ride from the hotel, to the airport.    We walked to our Gate, C9, and were boarded before Group 1, at 7:45am for our 8:15am departure. Our coats and overcoats were hung in the little closet, across from the galley, and we settled in with pre-departure wine, for the relatively short (1:58) flight. I was surprised to see a new white wine: Columbia Winery, Columbia Valley, WA 2014 Chardonnay. For a Pacific NW Chard, with a few years on it, this was not a bad wine.    We took off with a very low cloud ceiling, and were in clouds, or above a blanket of them, for most of the flight.    This was one of the newish 737-900's, and from the United side of the fleet, so it did not have the seat-back DirectTV found on the ships from the Continental side of the merger. This meant that it had Personal Device Entertainment (PDE), with streaming content delivered to one’s device via the United App. This service is free, but on this brief flight, neither of us used it. It had WiFi (for a fee), but we did not use that either on this flight.    The First Class cabin is configured 2-2 on these 737's, and with the seat supports, there are basically 3 underseat spaces. My small briefcase fit nicely below 3F, my hat in the middle, and my wife’s purse easily under 3E. Her rolling briefcase fit into the large overhead bins. On the newer 737's, the overhead bins have increased in size, and are now rather large, for a single-aisle aircraft. We really like these new bins. The seats are the same, as for all 737's, both the 800, and 900 series, and while OK, we like the FC seats in the A319/320 aircraft, a bit better. One caution on the 737's: the little drink tray on the podium between the seats does not have a lip on the front, so it’s possible that anything placed there, can slide off, and under the seat in front. We had adequate recline, and even with the underseat storage in use, adequate foot room. The pitch is adequate, but can get it a bit tight, if the passenger in front does a full recline. On this ship, the tray tables reached all of the way to the podium, where on a few of the older planes, they ride above, and often short of the podium. This makes for a bouncy tray table, that can be prone to spilling drinks.    With the short-duration flight, we had a Blueberry Muffin, which was pretty good - and more of the Chardonnay.    We arrived at ORD on-time, C-9, with rain, and weather building. As we had a 3:49 layover, I was concerned that it would deteriorate more, and delay our flight home to Phoenix. We headed off to the United Club in the B Concourse, for our departure out of Gate B-7..  The Gate Agents at IAD were very friendly, as was the entire Cabin Crew. Though short, this was a very nice flight.."
Apr 2020,30,May - UA456 Denver to Omaha A319 (#4896) FC Seats 2A & B,"May - UA456 Denver to Omaha A319 (#4896) FC Seats 2A & B    On May 16, we flew United Airlines UA456 from Denver (DEN) to Omaha (OMA), on an Airbus A319 (#4896) in First Class, Seats 2A & B. This was the same exact ship, that we had flown to Denver on, from Phoenix - the cabin crew was the exact same too! Some days, air travel feels like a “small world.” Now, we had come into B-27 at DEN, and were scheduled to go out of that gate too, but our ship was moved to B-12.    We had spent a bit of time at the United Club West, especially as it was closer to our original departure gate, B-27. Got the notice of the gate move, so headed down to the end of B Concourse West, and arrived a bit early. The gate area was already full, with lines formed up in the Group 1 & 2 queues, so we stood off to the side. That proved to be a big mistake.    When pre-boarding commenced, the gate agent yelled at us to move out of the way, as she had a wheelchair to board. Well, the area we were in, was maybe 25' wide, and we were standing well clear of anything. Then she pre-boarded Global Services fliers - that was us. She was obviously nervous that she had been shouting at us. That action was so atypical of all United staff, who we generally encounter, on 100's of flights per year.    As mentioned, we were on the same exact plane, with the same cabin crew, and I think that the cockpit crew was the same, as well. We even had our same seats, 2 A & B. Once more, we had jackets hanging on the bulkhead, immediately behind our seats, and my wife’s wheeled briefcases stored in the same spot, in the overhead bin. In First Class on the A319, the overhead bins are adequate, but with only 2 rows of 2-2 seating, the first portion of bins, above the starboard seat (E & F) is filled with safety equipment. My small briefcase and hat, went back below the seats in Row 1, and we had our pre-departure beverage, as boarding commenced. I recognized a few of the passengers from our earlier PHX to DEN flight - guess that this was a good connection between PHX and OMA, and that others had our destination in their plans?    As we had done a couple of glasses of white wine at the United Club, we declined both the pre-departure beverage, and anything on the flight - besides, my wife would need to head to meetings, when we arrived in Omaha.    The flight was totally uneventful, and we got out of Denver, before the impending weather could impact our flight. The weather did clear, landing at OMA, and we only had heavy haze. We were amazed at the flooding that we observed, on approach to OMA. We arrived at OMA on-time, and had our luggage quickly (OMA is small, and has always been very efficient), and were off to the Hilton, and my wife’s meetings.    As on our PHX-DEN portion of this flight, the cabin crew was excellent, and seemed to like to see us again. Other than the gate agent, and the odd moving of the plane by several gates, this was a very good flight."
Apr 2020,10,I bought the flight insurance and didn't get my money back when I cancelled my ticket.,"Don't bother buying flight insurance! I bought the insurance, cancelled my ticket, and didn't get my money back. They asked me for proof of sickness. I sent them all the papers they asked for including proof of treatment from my doctor but they closed my case anyway."
Apr 2020,30,Poor seating assignments for grown adult males,3 large men all in one row with empty seats they refused to allow 1 to move to empty seat so all 3 were miserable for the 12 plus hour flight crammed in like sardines
Apr 2020,10,My flight was cancelled due Covid-19 and the airline would only give me a credit and not refund my flight.,"United cancelled my flight due to Covid-19 and would only issue a credit and not a full refund. I also had flights scheduled with JetBlue, Southwest and Emirates and each airline issued me a full refund due to the uniqueness of this pandemic and were understanding of the situation. Customer service rep was extremely rude and I will never consider flying with this airline again."
Apr 2020,40,After numerous cancelled flights finally home !!!,"Great 1st impressions I asked the steward was it possible to be moved to sit with my husband Within a few minutes we were moved , I was eternally grateful as it was a long journey home. The flight was comfortable and we were very well fed and watered . In flight entertainment was very good variety of choices to watch. Due to coronvirus pandemic I felt that the staff handled the flight well and professional at all times .i would definitely fly this airline again."
Apr 2020,40,"Happily, an Uneventful Flight that got us there...","There are times when you're just relieved that you make it to your Connecting Flight, and it then simply gets you to your final destination, and, for us, this was one of those times - we had just traveled the long journey from Dublin, Ireland to SF, and needed to get to San Diego that evening.    United got us there, without grief, pain or especially notable Customer Service along our way : the well-lit view of San Diego as we descended was impressive, and - uncommon as it is - our Pilot landed us smoothly."
Apr 2020,10,No refunds,"Due to the pandemic I had to cancel my flight which was booked in October 2019 to leave in late March 2020. I was given a credit but it has to be used by October 2020. I find it ridiculous that given the issues at hand they expect me to fly to United States from Sydney before October 2020. At least give me a year from date of departure for the credit but 6 months is ridiculous. Unless we find a cure, I don’t see the government easing up on the restrictions put in place for me to be able to travel. Nor would I want to travel this year during these times. And to top it all off I only just booked seats for economy plus in mid Feb and cancelled my flight a few weeks later and they wouldn’t give me a refund for it or a credit."
Apr 2020,40,Very pleased with our flights,We were very nervous about our trip due to the coronavirus outbreak. We booked our in January through a third party. We were a bit disappointed that we paid twice the amount once the rates started dropping but this was nothing we could do about that. Our flight was on time going and returning. The plane was not as crowded. We didn’t have any issues.
Apr 2020,10,Cancelled my flight and refused to refund,"United Airlines cancelled my flight from Savannah, GA to Grand Rapids, MI on April 6, 2020 and has refused to issue me a refund, regardless of the fact that they cancelled and tried to rebook on a rediculus flight with extra legs that will not work with my schedule.  I had a similar issue with American Airlines last week and they issued a complete refund instantly with apologies.  NEVER AGAIN UNITED AIRLINES !!"
Apr 2020,30,Flying home,"We were returning home from a cruise which was impacted by port closures, We were fortunate to be on this flight to return us home!  We wer located at the bulkhead at the rear of the ecomomy+ section of the dreamliner. Behind our seats was a toilet, but we experienced no noise or any discomfort for being so close. Our seats reclined well and we had ample leg room. All this made for a comfortable ~15 hour flight.  The take off and landing were both good, a bit of a bump on landing but the pilots had done an excellent job to minimize any discomfort for the almost full flight.  This flight was filled with Australians returning home from different cruise liners with the Coronavirus outbreak problems on the mind of all aboard. The cabin crew were mostly all wearing masks and gloves. The meals provided were extremely basic, my wife and I made the identical dinner selection. But there was one difference, her meal was hot and mine was only warm. To me this is an issue!  But overall this was a good flight!"
Apr 2020,50,A Smooth Stage on Our Long Journey Home...,"The evolving Coronavirus + the imminent Travel Ban had forced us to abandon our original Schedule - a few days in SF, to be followed by a stay in DC - and we were now under a bit of pressure to get back home to Ireland. After a stressful Saturday March 14th in our SF Hotel Room, struggling to secure Airline Bookings, our impressively conscientious Dublin-based Agent, came to our aid, despite the 7 hour time difference.    To our huge relief, she managed to secure Seats on an early Sunday Flight with United to DC, 'hopefully connecting with an Aer Lingus Flight to Ireland. Leaving the quite impressive ""Omni San Francisco"" at 5.15 a.m., we got to United's Check-in, hauling several large Bags. These posed an initial challenge to staff - clearly unaccustomed to Passengers wishing to check everything through to Dublin, via Dulles.    But, a quiet, resourceful, competent young lady rescued her nonplussed United colleague (and us!), patiently and thoroughly following an unfamiliar procedure in a ""hands-on"" manner, and, then - with a warm smile - handed us the various Boarding Passes we would need, with 4 precious Baggage Tags. I couldn't read this lady's Name Badge, but did my best to sincerely thank her for her much-appreciated efforts on our behalf - she truly represented United extremely well that morning!    And so, on to our Flight to DC. At stressful times like this, it's a great relief to be able to say : ""Nothing to Report"" - our Flight departed on time, was smooth & comfortable, our Purser was not just capable but also quite charming, we arrived at Dulles on time.    We've criticized this Airline occasionally in the past, but this time around, we absolutely must say : ""Thank-you, United""!"
Apr 2020,10,Wish I could give 0 stars.,"After the airlines changing my flight times to miss a connecting flight, they found that me having to book through another airline to make a connecting flight and a meeting was my fault because there was less than a 24 hour difference I. My flight. Called customer service multiple times. They were less than accommodating and made no effort to help correct it at all and would not refund my Money. I would never fly this airline again and are very disappointed with the utter lack of customer service. They might as well just be spirit airlines."
Apr 2020,40,A short flight,"The flight we took was a intra state flight from San Diego to San Franscisco.  The checkin process was excellent booking our luggage in at San Diego to go through to Sydney, our final destination. The team member who checked us in was efficient, polite and provided a great first impression of the airline.  The boarding process was stress free, since there were only a small number of passengers on the flight.  We were offerred water and a snack on the flight. For a short flight  Take off was smooth and easy as was the landing - a little bump and then the application of brakes.  We arrived early!  A GOOD FLIGHT!"
Apr 2020,40,"Broad seats, best legroom",The seats in the United Airlines flights are broader with good legspace which I enjoyed very much. The complementary food service was ok and
Apr 2020,30,Not quite a Rhapsody in Blue...,"Attempting to ""Fly the Friendly Skies"" with United, from San Diego to San Francisco, Thursday March 12th, revealed very mixed standards regarding staff care, attention, helpfulness and basic sensitivity.    At the ""Premier"" Baggage Check, we struggled, as a staff member on one side of the Desk stood-by, giving little or no help, while on the other side, his colleague flitted back and forth, before, finally, giving us those precious reassuring Baggage Tags.    At Gate 44, a sour-faced Ms. CK seemed to be having a ""Bad Day"" : a group of semi-mobile Amputees arrived with their Carers, and her rude demeanor suggested she regarded them as just a ""nuisance"", as she barked instructions at colleagues who were frantically (and politely) trying to Tag the special Wheel-Chairs on which these people depend, before she brusquely processed their Boarding Passes. Wow!    On board, thankfully the contrast with all that had gone before could not have been more noticeable : throughout a smooth, uneventful Flight, our Cabin Purser, Christina, could not have been more pleasant, attentive and helpful.    Reflecting on all we had experienced and observed that day with this Airline, as we deplaned at SF, my sincere comment at the Door was : ""Thanks, Christina - United needs more People like You!"""
Apr 2020,10,Terrible customer relations during Corona Virus,"Due to Coronavirus, and due to the Hawaiian Governors imposing a quarantine on arriving guest to the islands, we had no choice but to cancel our trip. While hotels and car rentals are fully refunding, United is only providing vouchers. But the vouchers are good for only 1 year from the date of purchase of the ticket, not for 1 year from the scheduled flight. So that means we have only 6 months to reschedule. Due to the circumstances, that is entirely poor customer relations, and a poor response to the economic situation affecting passengers."
Mar 2020,30,i dont get this,check in took quite some time at san francisco. i arrived right before the gate was closed so i dont know how long boarding took. inside the cabin i notice that it is quite clean and i took a glimpse at the business class seats and they were lie flat in a 1 2 1 configuration with large screens so i have some expectations for the economy cabin. but i am disappointed to find out that legroom is not that great and that there are no screens. but there was a plug outlet and wifi. for entertainment you have to stream the media through your device and i really hate that setup but the stuff you could stream was pretty good.and this plane is a 777 which is huge and is used mainly on long haul flights so im a bit confused about the entertainment situation. no food was served. flight was very turbulent. landing at honolulu was alright. gets 5/10 from me.
Mar 2020,50,"Morning flight from Denver, CO to Los Angeles, CA","The boarding process went well. The seating in main cabin was 6 across with comfortable seats and adequate legroom for my 6'2"" frame. There was no entertainment provided except for the airline's app on your own device. There was free soft drink/snack service. The flight was about an hour and a half and arrived on time."
Mar 2020,40,Happily surprised,Pleasantly surprised by the plane and carrier. I had low expectations for the flight but the plane was better than I thought with decent leg room and I am over 6ft tall. Flight attendants were very pleasant and food and drinks were plentiful and of a good standard. Selection of flight entertainment was again plentiful and films etc were up to date. The whole family had a very comfortable and happy journey.
Mar 2020,30,Flight from Newark NJ to London Heathrow,"With this flight it was basic, seats were ok and legroom was ok , but you couldn't stretch out. I was glad my wife had packed some snacks for the journey as food was enough if you don't eat much. After a while into the flight we both tossed and turned , not enough comfort for a sleep. Luckily we could get up and go for a walk as there was not that many people onboard."
Mar 2020,40,San Francisco to Newark,"Having just flown from Sydney to San Francisco, our next part of the journey home was to Newark N J. our flight this time was in premium economy . It was a good enough seat and leg room, you had what you needed. The staff were attentive , food and beverage was fine."
Mar 2020,50,Covid19 no go as planned but United took care of me!,Wonderful during this unusual time to have an airline help their customers! I had a trip booked and the airlines canceled my flight and refunded me my seats and I have my $$ saved to use by May 2021! Much nicer than American Airlines who only gave us a few months eventhough our ski trip got reschedule for the same time next year. Thank you United!
Mar 2020,40,it has low prices on tickets to cabo,nothing special but a good price on tickets to cabo that's the main reason we always use united for our travels to cabo san lucas
Mar 2020,50,Flying in the Area of COVID-19,"It is a difficult time to travel, and things had been changing daily if not hourly.    I was scheduled to fly the third week of February, but had to schedule twice before I finally took off on March 6th. The customer service people I worked with booking my final flights were great, very helpful under difficult situations.    Flight crews were admirable, can’t say enough about the crews at boarding , flying, arrival."
Mar 2020,40,Good trip with United Airlines,My wife and I traveled to Mexico City last month with United airlines on business class. The flight was very pleasant. The service and food were really good. The seats were comfortable but the back of the seat did not go down ( that was not expected in business class seats ). We departed and arrived on time. The lounge in Chicago was average ( compared to other airlines ). The good was not great which was a disappointment considering Chicago is a main hub for United. Otherwise the lounge was very clean and spacious. The lounge in Mexico City was very good. The service and good were above average.  Overall experience with United was very good. I will definitely fly with them again.
Mar 2020,10,My history with United Airlines,"I have flown UAL for over 25 years for business on an average of 50-100K miles/year. While that may not seem like a lot of air miles to the road warriors it seems like quite a lot to me.  While I understand that we are all going through challenging times now, I find it hard to reconcile that United has the best interests of its long standing and loyal customers in mind as we navigate through this crisis. I am almost a 1M mile flyer and yet over these many years I have suffered through poor customer service, rude flight attendants and more restrictive policies for their most frequent travelers. We now are adjusting to a new norm where video conferencing is quickly becoming ubiquitous and quite frankly could be more efficient.    I am saddened that many people in the airline industry will be unemployed and my heart goes out to them and I hope that they will be able to find a new career path.  Once this crisis is over, I am going to seriously consider my options before booking an airline ticket with UAL. Maybe nobody at this company will care as they have hundreds of thousands of frequent flyers but at some small level it is my hope that maybe things may change."
Mar 2020,10,United left us stranded in foreign country,"We had tickets to the Dominican Republic. Once we got there things started to get crazy with the Covid 19. United canceled all their flights with no warning, and no option to get us home, they didn't even offer a refund. We had to buy tickets with Jet Blue and Delta to get us home. Thankfully other airlines care and worked with us. I will NEVER fly United again. They do not honor their tickets!"
Mar 2020,10,They told me to cancel via email.,I received an email about canceling my trip with step by step instructions on how to cancel and collect a refund.    So I followed instructions.    They won't refund me my purchase and I can not apply my credit to a new flight.
Mar 2020,50,Great rebooking service,My wife and I were not able to fly to Maui so we needed to rebook for October 2020. Talked with Loven and he was great to deal with. Took some time but we understood with what’s been going on. He got it all taken care of and it went very smooth. He got our seats moved and we even saved some money. Everything has cleared through the credit card and we are good to go. The other couple that we are going with also had great service and they rebooked with no problem. Thanks United customer service.
Mar 2020,10,Absolute worse customer service,My departure flight with delta was canceled so of course I had to cancel my return flight with United. When I called I was transferred between 3 people. 1 of which was rude. The second didn’t have a working phone and the third was completely incompetent. The entire world is shut down right now and people should be able to get refunds. They refuse to give me my money back bc my ticket is “not changeable” I would NEVER recommend using them to anyone. I’ve also submitted a claim to the BBB. This is a horrible unethical way to run a business
Mar 2020,10,(COVID-19) Waive change/cancellation fees??? What a joke!!!,"Long story short, United Airlines is taking advantage of customers and gouging prices for people that had to make mid-trip changes. We had to cut short our Europe trip from the USA and return home early. United only applied $150 ($75 per person) towards the return trip and we had to pay the difference of $1128.44! I'll explain more in depth as follows.    Our original booking we made was $1476.66 total for 2 passengers (Economy incl. seat assignments and checked bags). We began our trip when things were still a ""watch level 1"" and it was safe for travel to Europe. Halfway through all the news began about restrictions back to the States and airlines changing flights to be routed through the 13 approved CDC screening airports. We had to get back as soon as possible so I started doing my research. I assumed half my original cost would be applied to a one-way return trip. That of somewhere around $700 logically.    So my first step was to research what the current price was for a one-way trip, including seats and bags, for 2 passengers leaving within the next day or two. Using both Google Flights and United.com I found that the current price for a new booking was $1279. Now I'm ready to call fully expecting to pay $500-600 to change our flight.    After spending nearly 2 hours on hold I finally get connected. I don't demand anything and just leave it as open as possible to find out the best solution. I state that we still have a hotel booked for the next 5 nights so if we can move our flight any day earlier based on availability and price, the sooner the better though. Customer Service rep says, ""I can't search that, I need a specific date."" I'm thinking to myself, that's weird because I can search in a full calendar view, surely customer service has better tools than I do, but whatever. So I give him the date that I found earliest and cheapest, which was two days out, and for $1279 total.  He comes back with the amount owed of $1128.44 for the change.  I say, I thought there are no change fees and that I found the flight on United.com for $1279.  Rep: That is for new bookings only.  Me: What's the difference? There's no change fee...  Rep: I don't have that answer.  Me: Well is there any cheaper options?  Rep: I need a specific date.  Knowing I wasn't going to get anywhere with this Rep, I consented to paying the difference. Before I got off the phone, I verified it was for the exact same Economy level which already included seat assignments and checked bags. The Rep confirmed this to be true.    After all was said and done, I checked my email confirmation of the flight change. Here's what completely baffled me was the flight was priced at $2605.10 and our total round-trip flight was subtracted from that. How does that make sense?? We already took the first flight a week earlier. So to me it looks like United charged us the difference in price to fly to Europe as well, even though we didn't change that portion of the flight at all. To add further injury to the whole situation, the email didn't list what our seat assignments were. I checked our flight on the mobile app and this confirmed we had no seats. There were no seats left to choose in Economy so again I had to pay another $78 to upgrade to Economy Preferred. I never want to fly United again!!    Good job United for fooling the media that you're looking after your customers. Then rip us off on top of asking the government for relief funds!"
Mar 2020,10,Could care less about people during COVID19,I purchased tickets for a family vacation before all the madness started in the US. I called the airline to request a waiver if I needed to make changes to my flight booked for June 2020. The agent offered to change it but I wasn’t sure at that moment and requested that she place a note for me to call back at a later time. The time came for me to make those changes and I was surprised to be told they had no record of this note and would not allow a change to my low fare economy flight without penalty. I asked that they listen to the recording from the previous agent and I was told the recording would not matter because they will not honor the waived change fees. The funny part of it all is that United will receive more money for the change since I would be departing from a different state. United should feel ashamed of not helping people during this scary time. Especially when it’s not a loss of money. I was recently furloughed from my travel industry job and still being forced to take this trip. The least they could do is allow people to make necessary changes to feel comfortable going on a trip during these times. I will learn from this mistake and not fly with them in the future.
Mar 2020,10,Unhappy,Booked trip for two with miles. Charged$22. Had to cancel due to virus and being in high risk group. Charged $250 to return miles to account. Have appealed charge. Now airline wants Gov to bail them out. I say no.
Mar 2020,10,Terrible check in service,"In the midst of COVID19 and needing to get out of NYC to be with family I bought a last minute ticket. Once arrived at check in I was told I could not have any carry on bags and I would need to pay $100. The flight is completely empty as you can see in the picture and there is plenty of room for my carry on luggage. I told the woman I had just booked the ticket a couple hours ago and did not see that if she could please be flexible and she said no but I could check the bag for $35 instead of $100 to carry on. Such a massive inconvenience and now so many people touching my bag that I could have very easily carried on. Terrible service, no compassion for what’s going on and completely inflexible. Very disappointed, not a good time for you to be losing customers United!"
Mar 2020,50,Barbie did great!,"With the craziness of the virus, my flights have been cancelled now 3 times. I understand that. I was trying to rebook a cancelled portion of my flight home and spoke to Barbie on the phone. She was great. So personable and very helpful. I have had some very unpleasant experiences with United during normal but Barbie from St. Pete was awesome and I wanted someone to know that :)"
Mar 2020,30,Another United Flight,"Did the flight with United mid-February going to Narita with a stop at Denver; it’s a regular experience and nothing unusual on this trip. We had a delay on the second leg, at Denver due to aircraft maintenance issue, for 75 minutes which affected the arrival time in Narita. Upon arrival at Narita on this delayed flight from Denver, I applaud the Japanese staffs who assisted, greeted, prepared and rebooked our connecting flight. It’s all done, and the Japanese staffs handed us our boarding passes immediately after we cleared immigration. I hope this type of Outstanding customer service displayed by the Japanese staffs be mirrored and replicated to other United Airlines airport representatives worldwide, especially in the U.S."
Mar 2020,20,UNITED HORRIBLE WITH ME IN HOUSTON,"I WAS customer from 1995 to now and my flight from NYC to HOUSTON, flight connection, had a delay, technics reasons NOT THE WEATHER!!! and when WE ARRIVED to HOUSTON to have the connection to BUENOS AIRES, 40 minutes after, our plain WAS!... three days in HOUSTON, and NEVER RECEIVED anny COMPENSATION!!!"
Mar 2020,50,Flights during Covid 19,"I took 7 flights during a 2 week period in March 2020, within the US and between the US and Canada. Staff were very accommodating despite working during such a stressful time. I had a feeling that ""we were all in this together"".  I realized that while making several flight changes I paid twice/double for upgrades from economy to premium economy. I emailed United via their customer service site, explained the situation, and received refunds within 48 hours."
Mar 2020,10,will NEVER fly United again! They don’t care about their customers!!,"I would never recommend this airlines to anyone. Our family went to Punta Cana on March 14th and we were supposed to return the 19th... the day before we were supposed to leave, we received a text our flight was cancelled because of “runway conditions” and “they were working to get us on our way”. We NEVER received anything from them that would help us. We tried calling United SEVERAL times and sat on hold for hours and as soon as the call hit TWO HOURS the called would fail. We missed a whole day of vacation on the phone with United.. the next day we found out that United was no longer sending flights to the Dominican because they didn’t want to fly empty planes. They did not only LIE about the reason our flight was cancelled, but they left us stranded with NO help. I don’t know how an Airlines can legally do this to families... I will NEVER fly with United ever again. Shame on you!!! United Airlines should shut down if they really think it’s “okay” to treat their customers like trash!! Thankfully, JetBlue was passionate and caring. They actually cared that people got home to their families."
Mar 2020,10,Stranded my family in the Dominican Republic,"On March 14, 2020 my family flew to Punta Cana on United Airlines. We paid for a round trip ticket and were scheduled to return back to the USA on March 19, 2020. On Wednesday, March 18, we received a text message from United airlines stating that our return flight had been cancelled. United stated that the flights had been cancelled due to "" airport conditions on the runway/taxi way preventing your departure"". This was a deliberate lie by United. The Dominican Republic closed its borders to incoming flights. However foreigners were still permitted to return back to their country. United stranded us and did not return to pick up the people they had dropped off because they did not want to lose money on flying back to the Dominican Republic empty. This is highly unethical on United Airlines part. They should not receive a penny in any kind of bailout money if provided by the US government. JET BLUE came to the rescue and flew rescue flights to pick up US citizens and returned them back to the United States. They flew down empty to pick up their customers plus the customers that United had stranded. They are true heroes and an example of professionalism unlike United Airlines. We tried for 20 plus hours to reach United via phone and email to no avail. We were able to reach JET BLUE through our travel agent and get a flight home and our group was not stranded. I highly recommend that you choose another airline and would not fly with United Airlines they are unprofessional and unethical. I will never risk my family's well being with United Airlines ever again."
Mar 2020,10,Coronavirus,I am afraid of what this outbreak may cause to my loved ones and expected the flight attendents to be more careful. They were seriously less than 3 feet away talking to my face. There were elderly women on my flight they were getting up close with. Not to mention the seats were not wiped down and we were forced to all be together in the front. I am never using United again. Their employees did not take the covid-19 outbreak seriously.
Mar 2020,50,Great Flight,"We had a great experience. The airport staff, the flight attendants, and pilots were all very courteous and professional. My only complaint is that they could be easier on the luggage. One of our suitcases came off the carousel with the handle separated from the suitcase. Other than that everything was great."
Mar 2020,10,Seriously?,How can you still be charging fees for flight change or cancellation? While still asking for handouts from the govt in the form of bailouts! Disgusting. Called today about my June 2 flight asked what my options were based on the fact that I knew I was a basic economy ticket. I was informed that if I just paid a small one time $50 fee that they could go ahead and cancel my flight and I would receive full credit of my fares minus the $50. In this uncertain economy and health crisis I am amazed that a company would be so asinine!    I will survive and the cost is probably industry standard but ridiculous none the less! I should’ve stuck with an amazing airline for their policies and their service SOUTHWEST has been my go to for over ten years and I caved in a cheap flight for this one! Damn!
Mar 2020,10,"No care, no respopnsibility","Really disappointing experience here. Flights home to Australia were booked through a travel agent but then the airline cancelled and re-routed these flights. They changed the final destination which meant a connecting flight was missed. When they were asked to rectify this, they point blank refused and this meant we had to book another flight to get home, at our cost. Extremely poor efforts here by United."
Mar 2020,50,Close Quarters,Flight convenient for your budget. On time and courteous Crew. Seating is a little tight as well as Bathrooms. Smooth flying. Opt for TSA Pre check.
Mar 2020,50,Very light loads due to Covid-19,"Quick trip back for family visit - normal load on flight back to the Land of Sky Blue Waters, but the return a week later was very light on both legs (3/18/2020) . 23 people on a 737 designed to hold 180+ passengers and 4 passengers on our 50 passenger United Express legs. Needless to say we got great service from the staff due to the light loading. Both flight legs on the return arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule on 90 minute flights due to the light loads."
Mar 2020,50,On time and comfortable,"My recent United Airlines flight (March 8th, 2020) was excellent. We boarded on time, there was plenty of room in the overhead bins for baggage despite the flight being full, we were able to pushback early and arrived at our destination on time despite weather creating turbulence along the way."
Mar 2020,10,EXCESS BAGGAGE,"My wife and i traveled from miami to NJ on United, we took to bags and it was a straight through travel, we were charged 10 EXCESS BAGGAGE bills on my credit card. Unable to reach them filed a complaint on AMEX the credit card used for the travel transaction. They did not put the money back, no you must know they never informed me the bags were over, on the way there the bags were not full to capacity and weigh in before travel, same on the way back so unless both my scale and the one at the hotel were bad United did not do their job and lets say they are correct and i'm saying they are not, they should have informed me the bags were over so i might have a chance to decide what to do and not simply charge me and having to find this out when i looked at my amex account. This is not a minor charge it was huge $1,150.00 they are a cheap airline that might charge a fair airline ticket bu these cheap tactics will hopefully drive them out of business. Be careful with United so this does not happen to you.  Hector"
Mar 2020,40,Lots of space to stretch out,"There were about 20 people in coach so lots of room to stretch out. They served a selection of snacks and a cup of water as it is a short flight. The crew was very nice. It was very cold on the plane so I suggest a sweater or jacket for this flight. However, the next flight was very warm."
Mar 2020,40,Premium Plus on United with an infant,"I was duly impressed by the United Premium Plus experience, to be frank it was better than Singapore airlines and Lufthansa in terms of the space and a feeling of luxury. The food was the only part we felt was average. However, the amenities, the staff, the seats were all top notch and made up for the food. This was about a month before the COVID-19 cases got out of hand in Europe and we were to finish our travel in Feb itself. The baby was happily trundling around and was in good spirits almost the entire journey. The bassinet was much too small, probably only for infants smaller than 6 months. Out guy was about 18 months at that time. United doesn't offer baby food which we felt was odd, almost all other airlines we have traveled with, have this option. The entertainment system was good, we didn't use the onboard wifi. The overall experience was positive, I have to admit, I had my reservations but I was pleasantly surprised."
Mar 2020,50,"On time performance, so setbacks or delays","Given the stress of CORVID-19, the trip was excellent and ahead of schedule with excellent on board service and entertainment. We arrived at ORD where Customs was efficient during this trying time of excessive crowds returning home. We made it through and were able to get our UA flight 2000 to IAD where again we landed ahead of schedule. We and our baggage made it through without any issues and all personnel and procedures were professional and attentive."
Mar 2020,40,Great Flight,"The check in was chaos (approx. 2:45 min in line), about 700 persons trying to leave Spain account of covid-19. Once through check-in it was a breeze. The service aboard was excellent along with the seats and food...and booze if you want it! The Flt Attendants did MORE than their job and really put much more into their service than was necessary or expected. They have finally gotten their act together."
Mar 2020,50,Flight Attendants calmed me down,"I just wanted to give the flight attendants on board UA 78 a HUGE thank you. The whole crew, especially Dina and Melanie were like guardian angels for me when I found myself having a panic attack 10 hours into the trip on 3/21. I was very sleep deprived and emotional, but something made me go back to the galley and chat with these flight attendants. After a calming chat, a snack and soothing herbal tea🍵 -I was guided back to my seat and sure enough was able to catch some shut eye before landing in Newark, NJ. So thank you....so so much for the amazing customer service! It made my first long flight during an anxious time in the world a pleasant one.    Emily Maffucci  Philadelphia, PA"
Mar 2020,10,United steals your frequent flyer miles,"We had a frequent flyer flight to Malta. United cancelled the Munich to Malta portion of this trip, but would not redeposit the miles to my account unless I paid them $250 - FOR A FLIGHT THEY CANCELLED!    This is criminal behavior, and they’re begging for a government bailout. I hope they go under. Good riddance."
Mar 2020,50,My final lag home!,The flight left on time. The plane was clean and the staff was polite and attentive.  I arrived in Kansas City 20 minutes early. I recommend United.
Mar 2020,50,Thank you,"I like to write a thank you note to Croatia, Lufthansa, and United Airline, especially the ground check-in personnel at Zagreb airport, Croatia.    I was traveling on Friday, 3/13/20, just hours before US President Trump's cancellation of US-European flight deadline. I've mentioned to the check-in desk that I only have 1 hour at London for my connecting flight at Heathrow back to LAX. Normally, this would be cutting very close & giving the circumstance, is almost mission impossible.  They check-in lady at Zagreb re-assure me they'll give me a close to front seat assignment & help me anyway they can to get my connection flight back to LAX at Heathrow, and they did.    And once I get to Heathrow & on-board at United, people were definitely a bit worry because of the situation, but the United airline onboard crew re-assure us they'll get us safely & taking all pre-caution with healthy concern.    All these, I thank them at a special time like this. Thank you."
Mar 2020,10,LIARS/WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"If I could give them zero stars I would. My boyfriend and I were returning from vacation and unfortunately due to some weather issues we had to cancel our original flight. But before doing that the airline continuously kept pushing it back and would not give us any answers as to how long or even if we were going to be getting home at all that day. We had better answers from people that we called from our hometown then we got from the concierge. Not only that they were very rude and insensitive to anyone’s feelings. Finally we were able to find someone who was relatively polite. He switched our flights to another location that was close enough to home that we would be able to rent a car and drive, he was also the only person who told us that they were going to continue to push back our flight and never tell us that it would be canceled and we would be stuck. He also told us that the company would reimburse us for the rental car since they had to cancel our flight so many times and print it out and wrote down specific instructions for me to be able to receive my refund. Feeling weary about this I asked two other employees at the desk working for United who also confirmed that I would be able to get a refund. I got all my facts and got everyone’s names to make sure that I would not get screwed over and lo and behold after requesting my refund for the rental car they gave me some stupid points for a flight and told me tough crap. Maybe going to say they never give refunds to anyone for anything like that. When I stressed to them The severity of the money I had lost they did not care at all. They are insensitive and rude and only trying to get money out of you. They told every single person on my flight got canceled they could do the same thing as us, at which point they did. So they lied to an entire flight of people saying they would be refunded and never refunded anyone. That’s crooked and I will never support a company like this and I suggest none of you do either. They are planes were old and outdated and my overall experience was horrible I would much rather fly a literally any other airline other than this one.The severity of the money I had lost they did not care at all.

Mar 2020,50,NYC 2020,"Great flight, great service even under the circumstances of getting out of New York right before the shutdown. I have flown United for years and they have always tried their best to keep me coming back."
Mar 2020,10,No notification of flight cancellation!,"In the midst of COVirus and travellers trying to get home United cancelled a lot of their international flights. In our case it was the Auckland to San Francisco portion of our flight in Business Class on March 30th. Instead, we were told to get ourselves at our own cost to Sydney, and they would fly us home from there on March 31st. I asked the agent to ensure there were no travel restrictions transiting Australia on March 30-31st as we would have to stay overnight. She said there were none. Got off the phone and told my Aussie friend what our plans were and said we had to transit Australia in the next 48 hours! The border was not going to be open that much longer for international transit. So I called United back, waited 2 hours on hold and asked to be put on the Sydney to San Fran flight on March 23rd (tomorrow at that time). Basically they said they could do it if we PAID another $7000 total for the business fare! What a total rip off and customer service mistake. THEY CANCELLED the flight to begin with and we just want to return home. This also took 6 hours on the phone to try and straighten out with United to no avail...    M"
Mar 2020,10,"Trip from Chicago O Hare to LGA , NY","In these hard times of COVID -19, my son and I ( physician) had to travelled urgently to vacate my son’s dormitory at UIUC. We had 2 small bags and 2 medium bags. The flight had a total of 10 passengers. Despite the explanation, and even on request, the United Airlines charged us for our bags. I thought that was totally inappropriate. It’s not that we cannot pay for the baggage; we sure can! But in difficult times, everyone should help to the best of their ability, which clearly United Airlines didn’t."
Mar 2020,40,An on-time flight with good service,"This flight was on 10th March. The departure was on time and landed about 20 minutes early. There were periods of turbulence and the stay-in-seat announcements were timed well. The flight attendants were cheery and helpful, bringing water and guiding people to available toilets. I fly United often and found this one to be above-standard."
Mar 2020,50,"Good flight in business, IAH-AMS","We flew in business from Houston to Amsterdam. We booked business class since it’s an overnight flight and we wanted lie-flat seats. Business class was a 1-2-1 configuration and you get your own pod so there’s lots of privacy. In flight entertainment, meals and amenities were all great on this flight.    Flight was smooth and service was outstanding. We left Houston a little late but arrived on time in Amsterdam."
Mar 2020,10,No more United,"Because of what happened to Dr. Dao, I no longer fly United Airlines. I pray that people avoid United Airlines. This could happen to anyone."
Mar 2020,10,Flying in the US is a quest to find the lowest common denominator - United is it!,"I'll walk, drive, take a bus, a train, a boat or ride a donkey before I ever fly with United again. The seat pitch is so tight that only small children could possibly be comfortable in their seats. On our 5 hour flight, the plane could not maintain a steady comfortable cabin temperature and some people were resorting to disrobing. The in flight service is dismal at best. Free would still be too much to charge passengers. The only positive experience with United was de-boarding!"
Mar 2020,10,Refuse to refund cancelled flight,They have cancelled my direct flight from europe to the states and changed my flight to two flights through newark with extra 6 hours it total to reach my final destination. I have called numerous times your customer sevice and they refuse to provide me a refund!!!! I never accepted to the new flight change! I have been speaking with united's customer care in Houston Texas as well as their supervisor Valerie Greenwood - the worst customer experience of my life!!!!
Mar 2020,50,Family comes first.,"I had to fly from Houston to Detroit for a family funeral. While I was a little nervous about flying at the beginning of the Covid 19 Virus I took precautions. I had Clorox wipes for my seat, tray, seat pocket seat belts, etc. As it turned out I had the entire section to myself as I'm sure many people were starting to cancel. United is our choice of airlines because normally they go where we want to go and when. I compared other places and between the extra charges, I got a much better price."
Mar 2020,40,We got upgraded on the way to Cancun,We had bought the economy basic ticket but because the flight was full we got upgraded to Economy plus (and separated). 2 out of 3 people got upgraded and one say separately which was not convenient but the flight itself was comfortable. There was turbulence so we weren’t served anything.
Mar 2020,20,No Entertainment,"Five hour Honolulu to San Francisco flight pre-virus. Never could get any entertainment in the economy cabin, although business class had entertainment. Luckily I had a book, but I could tell many were disappointed. If wasn't a night flight, so it was particularly long with no movies."
Mar 2020,50,Better Than Most,"United is my airline of choice and I have been flying with them for over 30 years now racking over 750000 miles with them. They aren't perfect by no means and I have gotten frustrated with them at times as I have seen the quality of service over the years not being what it once was. These are trying times for their employees but i want to say my travel experience with United from Tulsa to Chicago recently was assuring as all the employees I came across from the gate agent to the flight atttendants had great positive attitudes despite the concern of them being exposed to hundreds of people daily who may be carriers of viruses, colds and everything else. My travel right now has been curtailed as has most business people and I had to cancel out several flights but appreciate what the airline is trying to do to minimize the rebooking hassles when I do start flying again. Good job United!"
Mar 2020,50,Best Under the circumstances,"Originally was booked on Lufthansa out of Dublin going through Frankfurt back to the US. With the COVID-19 spreading and US travel restrictions, was able to get re-booked on United Airlines out of Dublin direct to U.S (member of Star Alliance). Because the travel ban just started (midnight the day prior), the main issue was with US CBP at Dublin Airport--we went through a 3 hour line with subsequent flight delay. Once cleared, the United flight was awesome and the crew very flexible with the delay and uncertainty. Because we had already cleared CBP in Dublin, we landed like a domestic flight and went right to our next flight. United did a great job this day!"
Mar 2020,50,Great Customer experience,"Carmen P at Port Columbus Airport. Deserves a raise for sure. We had a mix up when it came to our luggage and she didn't notice a beat fixing our issue. Most people would have simply avoided our issue, but not Carmen; she got on the phone and provide that old fashion customer service that we no longer see these days. We salute her for helping us."
Mar 2020,30,Trying Their Best,The service was as expected in economy. The crew tried their best under the trying circumstances of the virus. The United Club was clean and comfortable. The transfer in Narita to ANA was easy and the ANA club was clean and not crowded.
Mar 2020,40,"A bit of a bus ride, but ok none-the-less","During the early period of the Covid-19 scare in the US, Asian nations had already experienced at least 5 weeks of pressure to avoid epidemic-levels of person-to-person transmission. In contrast, United Airlines had not made much change in its procedures at the time of the flight I took, which was 02/29/2020. UA executives had not, as a class of company staff, understood much about rapidly changing market conditions, apparently. However, the staff on the bus were entirely professional at all times, and observed good hygiene practices both among themselves and with the passengers. The plane landed in good order. Had it not, the news would have been widespread. Except for the screeching 4-year old child whose American mother was thoroughly anxious to cater to the child's every screech, the flight was fine. The UA staff were fine, and the trip, which began in Taiwan, was fully OK. UA management had better attend to the well-being of the staff who represent the company to its customers. Not to do so will affect future customer satisfaction, particularly now, during this time of confusion and fear, that customers will judge carriers' operations by how their front-line staff are perceived."
Mar 2020,10,Refusing a refund,"We’ve booked internal flights with United in the USA in April. Clearly, we can’t now use those tickets as travel from UK to USA is banned. It’s not our choice - it’s quite simple - we’ve paid and United can’t deliver. So, a refund, you’d think? Sorry, say United, we’re only offering the chance to rebook in the next 12 months. In my book, that’s theft or fraud. Interestingly, it seems this is quite normal for United."
Mar 2020,20,Flying experience! Disgusting!!,"Our first flight with UNITED and felt disgusted in our 35 years of flying experience! * We were given no food choice. Flight seemed as a chartered flight for Indian-American-Gujarati travelers with only SPICY HOT vegetarian meal. * Snack served was ice cold vegetarian! low grade Indian biscuits ""GLUCOSE -D"" * Shortage of in-flight stewards/ess who appeared over worked and tired. * Shortage of wash rooms for a long 15 hours' flight, a constant line up of 5 to 6 passengers! We realized UA minimized number of washrooms to add more 17"" wide seats in 3-4-3 configuration for more revenue! * The passengers were treated like a herd of cattle. UA needs to treat all fare paying passengers equally and with respect."
Mar 2020,10,Worst Customer Service EVER.,"Worst customer service in the world.  Had to change flights due to corona and the website didn't let me use my future flight credit. The website kept flipping between the old site and the new site which made it extremely frustrating to use. I finally had to call and after a 2 hour and 10 min wait time, I was connected with a representative, we exchanged pleasantries and then she promptly said ""please call back later"" and hung up. 2 HOURS and 10 MINUTES on hold just to be hung up on!!! I finally called back later and after a 45 minute wait I was connected with a snake. I was looking at a flight that cost $200 per ticket and they were telling me that the cheapest flight available was $375!!! I will NEVER fly United again. Southwest and Alaska Air are 10 times better customer service. The flight change for Alaska was a piece of cake and took less than 15 mins to cancel and re-book with a voucher directly to my email that was available for use instantly. United took 3 hours on hold, 2 phone calls, and 4 days for the voucher to be half-way usable. Couldn't use it to cover seat purchases either!"
Mar 2020,40,Nice flight staff,Flight staff was friendly and helpful. We traveled with 4 kids and the flight staff made sure that each of them had what they needed to make the flight pleasant for everyone on board.
Mar 2020,10,Horrible experience !!!!,"It is the worst airline EVER !!! Much worst than all cheap providers.    We booked tickets with United from USA do Mexico... Direct 4 h flight. There were much cheaper options available but I wanted to fly directly and I was willing to pay for this. Recently. the airline changed the flight status so my flight takes 20 h instead of 4h, I need to change and I land 1 day later than planed ! I understand this can happen when the COVID-19 is present but normally airlines gives you opportunity to accept or decline a change and get a full refund BUT NOT UNITED !!  You are not able to get money back but some useless credit, even though they changed your flight, you need to land the day after and it can completely destroy any travel plans if you have another connection    I will never, ever fly with United again and I am pretty sure a lot of other people will do the same. Very unprofessional, money oriented company with no-customer care.    Horrible experience"
Mar 2020,20,First Class Had Very Little Class Service,For the first 45 minutes of the flight the first class attendant was hustling about the cabin tending to the passengers as you would expect when flying first class. After that he disappeared and I noted him and the other attendants gathered in his galley socializing for the remainder of the flight. Hence first class became no class might as well sat in the back of the plane!!!!!
Mar 2020,50,United Airline flight from Honolulu to San Francisco,"On schedule, arriving on time. Friendly flight attendant. The captain informed us all details during the flight"
Mar 2020,30,Fly the Crabby Skies,"Seriously.....our flight had 28 passengers out of 162 seats. This should have been a breeze. It's rare to have a FA greet you at the door anymore....they hide in the galley texting on their personal cell phones. I don't understand why....when you smile and thank a FA for pouring a drink or delivering a snackbox, why are they unable to respond in kind?? I know your job is hard but please don't complain in front of customers about your ""Awful schedule"" or how you ""Just wanna get home"". We all wanna get home, honey....let's try and make it enjoyable, shall we??"
Mar 2020,50,Great Service!,The staff was very courteous and professional and went above and beyond in helping us reschedule when we had an unfortunate experience during our vacation.
Mar 2020,40,April - UA656 Phoenix to Chicago 737-900 (#3840) FC Seats 2A & B,"April - UA656 Phoenix to Chicago 737-900 (#3840) FC Seats 2A & B    On April 22, we flew United Airlines UA656 from PHX to ORD on a 737-900 (#3840) in First Class, seats 2A & B. This was a business trip, for 2 days of meetings in Chicago. This plane had arrived at PHX from DEN, the night before, so was ready to go.    We began the morning (7:45am departure) at the United Club, near Gate 7 in Terminal T2 at PHX. Our flight was moved from Gate 6A to Gate 8, but that was of zero consequence, as there are 3 gates in the same pier, 6A & B and 8. Those are the old Continental gates, and just down from the United Club. Those three gates are a bit crowded, but the newish 2-lane boarding scheme has really freed up gate real estate, so this area is not as crowded, as it once was. Before the boarding lane change, it was often impossible to tell if one was in the correct line, for the correct gate, but not any longer.    We boarded pretty much on-time, and as we board before the 1K and Group 1 passengers, were quickly into our seats, and ordered sparkling wine, for the pre-departure beverage.    Boarding was completed rather quickly, and we pushed back from the gate on-time. We encountered some haze, but had a pretty clear flight for much of the 1440 mile, 3.5 hr flight to ORD. Takeoff was on Runway 25R, so we were headed east already.    This was one of the newer 737-900's, with the larger overhead bins (really quite a bit more room on these ships), and the “Dreamliner” cabin lighting. Row 2 is just where the fuselage begins to taper forward, but the very slight decrease in width is barely noticed. As this plane was from the United side of the merger with Continental, it had on-board IFE, and not DirectTV (as most of the sCO 737's have), so good underseat storage, even with the taper. My small briefcase fit easily at my feet, and my hat in the center section. My wife’s purse fit easily in front of her aisle seat, and her small rolling briefcase easily in the overhead bin. Our jackets and overcoats were hung in the closet, forward, and across from the galley. The seat width is very good, as is the legroom. The windows are slightly displaced, with the forward window being behind the seatback for Row 1.    The haze gave way to clouds, but not before a few glimpses of the Painted Desert, with some impressive Spring green, among the red rocks - but very few. The weather cleared a bit, into ORD, but nothing impressive. We did get a few very quick views of snow-capped peaks in New Mexico, but mainly clouds below, so no impressive views. While many consider the mid-section of the USA to be “fly-over country,” there can be some impressive sites, if the weather is clear, but those were not to be on this flight.    We had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) delivering streaming media via one’s device, and the United App. This was free, and worked well. It was also equipped with WiFi (for a fee), but neither of us used that, so I cannot comment on how well it worked.    As this was the “breakfast flight,” we had our choice between:  Smoked-turkey Salad w/ boiled egg, almonds and cheese - actually pretty good  Egg Frittata w/ spinach, and a tomato/pepper sauce - also not bad  Both came with the Chobani Yogurt (mixed berry), a small fruit bowl, and one’s choice of bread.    I stuck with the sparkling wine, while my wife switched over to coffee.    We did a fly-over of ORD, so got to approach from the east, over Lake Michigan a bit. Unfortunately, the haze we had encountered at takeoff, persisted, and we had some high clouds, so our views of the beautiful Chicago skyline, and Lakeshore, were not the best.    We landed at ORD essentially on-time, and pulled into Gate B3, in Terminal 1 (moved from Gate B5) at 1:00pm, and had our luggage out onto Carousel 5 rather quickly. Historically, we find that baggage on UA at ORD is rather quick. In moments, we were out to curbside to find our driver, and head downtown, to the Gray Hotel, for my wife’s meetings.    The flight was pleasant, the food pretty good, and the UA service, from the Gate Agents at PHX, to the Cabin Crew on our flight, all excellent. The seat comfort, and legroom were very good, and everything on our flight worked well."
Mar 2020,40,April - UA1603 Chicago to Phoenix 737-900 (#3829) FC Seats 4E & F,"April - UA1603 Chicago to Phoenix 737-900 (#3829) FC Seats 4E & F    After a short business trip, on April 24, we were back to Chicago O’Hare Airport, to fly home to Phoenix. As the weather was turning a bit iffy, and as my wife’s meetings ran short, we moved up our pickup time, to get to the airport a bit early. As it turned out, we ended up with more time, than anticipated, so spent it in Concourse C, at a wine bar, a mini brew pub and the United Club, near Gate C-22, from which we departed.    We flew UA1603 from ORD to PHX on a 737-900 (#3829) in First Class, Seats 4E & F. We had taken this flight twice in March, and once on a 737-900 (#3467), and also on an A320. We boarded on-time at 3:40pm, and were in our seats, with a glass each of sparkling wine, as our pre-departure beverage.    While the weather at ORD was not as threatening, as what it had seemed, when we were still downtown, in River North, we did fly into heavy clouds - that weather was on its way, just farther out, than we anticipated. We had the heavy clouds for most of the flight, but it cleared nicely for our 6:00pm arrival into PHX - a lovely Spring evening.    Our jackets and overcoats were stored in the little closet across from the galley, and we were settled in for our flight home. Boarding had been fine at C-22, which is a bit larger, and more roomy, than some of the recent gates in the B Concourse.    This was one of the newish 737-900's, and from the United side of the fleet, so it did not have the seat-back DirectTV found on the ships from the Continental side of the merger. This meant that it had Personal Device Entertainment (PDE), with streaming content delivered to one’s device via the United App. This service is free, and worked fine - but we had flown so much, that I had already watched every movie of interest. It had WiFi (for a fee), but we did not use that on this flight.    First Class is configured 2-2 on these 737's, and with the seat supports, there are basically 3 underseat spaces. My small briefcase fit nicely below 3F, my hat in the middle, and my wife’s purse easily under 3E. Her rolling briefcase fit into the large overhead bins. On the newer 737's, the overhead bins have increased in size, and are now rather large, for a single-aisle aircraft. We really like these new bins. The seats are the same, as for all 737's, both the 800, and 900 series, and while OK, we like the FC seats in the A319/320 aircraft, a bit better. One caution on the 737's: the little drink tray on the podium between the seats does not have a lip on the front, so it’s possible that anything placed there, can slide off, and under the seat in front. We had adequate recline, and even with the underseat storage in use, adequate foot room. The pitch is adequate, but can get it a bit tight, if the passenger in front does a full recline.    As has been the case on several ORD-PHX flights, there were no warmed mixed nuts served. This seems hit, or miss, with more recent misses.    As this was the “dinner flight,” we were treated to:  Tandori Chicken w/ rice - pretty good, though chicken was a bit dry  Thai-style Chicken Salad over Udon Noodles - this dish, plus its beef counterpart is getting rather old and tired, and the noodles were again too sweet  Both came with a Blueberry Cheesecake, with was really pretty good.    We arrived at PHX on-time, and our luggage was out fairly quickly onto Carousel 4. In no time, we were headed home, and there was still light in the say. Another short trip behind us.    The Gate Agents at ORD were very good, as was the entire Cabin Crew. Other than growing a bit tired of the meals, and the movie selections on the PDE, this was otherwise a very good flight."
Mar 2020,30,An average airline with first class service!,"I am an ex-flight attendant so I know the hard work that goes into the profession. It's not just about serving food and drink. It's about the safety of the passengers in a life and death situation. The efforts of Loretta and her trainee, Felecie, were outstanding! What a fantastic job by these professionals! Loretta was personable, friendly, always had a smile and she was patient with Felicie all the while training her and attending to the needs of the cabin. Together they made the flight comfortable, relaxing and enjoyable. The only reason I give the airline an average rating is the cost of business class. It really is nothing more than premium economy with complimentary food and drinks. The seats don't recline all the way down so I couldn't get comfortable because of a broken back. Which is why I upgraded to business in the first place. Very disappointing. They need to reevaluate the cost and effect of business class. Next time I'll try another airline. But Loretta and Felecie were the bright stars in the galaxy. They were awesome!"
Mar 2020,40,Average to food service,"I flew economy from SFO to Dulles and Business Class from Dulles to Geneva. As always service depends on crew you have. Service was generally good. As usual I have a glass of wine with the appetizer. Then, depending what I eat I have white or red wine with the meal. Crew is servicing the cabin but they never check/ask whether I would like more wine. A detail but I expect a little more attention in Business Class."
Mar 2020,30,"Well, I got where I was going to !","Seats were tight , and I'm not a BIG guy . People wouldn't even talk, like they shut down. And the young man that was sitting in the seat behind me kept coughing and NOT covering his mouth .UGH ! I could feel my hair moving when he was coughing ! What's wrong with these young people ?"
Mar 2020,50,Great Customer Service,"I know people like to complain about the airline industry, but we had a great experience March 4th on United. Due to weather conditions on the east coast our flight was going to be delayed more than an hour. So we would have missed our connection in Houston. The lady started looking at the next flight to get to Cozumel, was though Dallas on American Airlines. She immediately booked us on that flight which left in an hour. We made it with no problems. I'am very sorry I did not get her name, but thank you United. Also American gave us great service also because the other flight to Cozumel was delayed, and that lady at American got us on the last flight out. Thanks American."
Mar 2020,50,Getting its act together,"A near perfect flight. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. Only the smallest detail was missed, clearing the side table of a glass promptly (a breakage risk). On the negative side, the main course was generously portioned but not really good. (The breakfast snack was very good.) This was my first very long haul flight on United with the more modern seating (1 across), and it was almost as good as the best of Lufthansa overseas - just the luxury details missing"
Mar 2020,10,United Vacations - horrible customer service,"I am so incredibly frustrated!!! United airlines is so responsive and helpful, so I decided to book through United Vacations – I have had the complete opposite experience.    I booked a package and in 24 hours the price went down. I have spent hours and days trying to reach someone to talk to honor the lower rate. I finally had to send through email. The first response was that they would honor the new rates, but I would need to call customer service – HA, what a joke. There is no chance you will EVER get anyone on the phone.    The second email response was so not helpful, basically they would not honor the new rates and I could go ahead and cancel.    I went online and cancelled, however there is no notice of any penalties, until you have already cancelled…. WHAT!!! HORIIBLE experience.    I again tried to call and was told my wait time was 4 minutes (jackpot, I thought) BUT NO, every time the recording came on with wait times, it went up and up to 80 minutes which I waited.    I have NEVER been so frustrated making travel plans    I am Gold status with United and have been very loyal….. I do understand this is a tough time, but why should I get penalized by not getting the better rates.    Oh my … I waited and finally got to talk to someone, who put me on hold and never came back – 2.5 hours later they hung up on me. I called again and after only 1.5 hours this time was told they could not do anything for me and that I would have to pay the penalty for cancelling at $200/ticket. REALLY, with everything going on, I am appalled and will never use them again.    It was the worst experience EVER!!! At the end of the day all I was asking for was to re-instate my reservation (same day as I cancelled) to not have to pay the penalty and give me today’s rates. Really poor customer service."
Mar 2020,40,A Quiet Flight,"We always fly United, when available, due to the link with Marriott. The flights on this day were in relatively new aircraft. Both were clean and had been disinfected prior to boarding. Both flights departed on-time and arrived early. Staff was courteous and attentive.  Our only complaint is United revoked our Premier Silver status without notice for no apparent reason. When we inquired as to why, we are getting a run-around regarding registering every year, which we have done, and their system acknowledges that registration as it will not let us register again. Go figure!!"
Mar 2020,40,One of the few enjoyable United flights,"We were not yet in lock down but every day things were getting scarier. We found that our final day of meetings was short so we paid the fee to book an earlier flight. The 1st class upgrade was $130 but dropped the $30 bag fee for regular class so 1st Class for $100! The flight was fine, the airport empty. The plane mostly empty. Non-event really. United 1st as pretty good."
Mar 2020,50,Usually Fly with United,"Round trip flight there and back was great. Flight Attendants made us feel like First Class. Flew in January, February and March. (US/Caribbean) All flights good experience."
Mar 2020,10,United's Predatory Policy,"UNITED canceled my husband and I's flight and intends to keep our money interest free for 12 months and then we can APPLY for a refund to hopefully get our money back. And these guys expect a taxpayer funded bailout on top of it? One, I shouldn't have to apply for a refund, it should be automatic, and two, my money should be returned to me immediately because I purchased a service and THEY cancelled said service. Loaning them money was not part of the bargain. What a scam. With people hurting financially right now, outrageous to say the least. I will never utilize United again and want people to be aware of their loan scam. Southwest Airlines has MUCH better customer service and policies. I've never had this issue with them.    I should note I already contacted United directly and this post is in response to their message."
Mar 2020,40,Flights are great,I love United Airlines. I have flown with them since I was a toddler and would pick them over any airline. The seats are comfortable and the individual entertainment is great. The staff has always been nice. The food is pretty decent as well. The only bad experience I have had was on the phone. We booked another airline through United for our return flight and the day before got notification our flight was pushed back two days. This was not possible for us as we had to return to work. Against my better judgement I called the airline. Granted this is overseas so I’m getting charged. I was on hold for over an hour. The representative was nice but after being on the phone for over two hours I was told the other airline wasn’t accepting calls and they needed to fix it on their end and there was nothing they could do for me I needed to contact the other airport. She was nice and apologetic but it was very disappointing. As they weren’t accepting calls we had to go to the airport and pray the other airline could book us a flight that day.
Mar 2020,10,Never Fly with United Airlines!! Worst Airline Ever!,"I worked for retail companies in the past and I always give companies top reviews as long as I have no major issues, because I know that some companies actually base a small portion of employees’ hourly/salary wages on reviews and there is no reason to give a person a less than 100% review for possibly having a bad day or event in their lives, or because I don’t necessarily agree with the company. I’m an extremely reasonable person, but here it goes:    If I could rate this airline a zero, I absolutely would. This is the one and only company in the entire United States that I can say I absolutely loathe! I’ve had more luggage lost than any other airline, more cancellations, more delays, and the loooongest hold times to speak with customer service (2-4 hours in my experience, probably because they have so many issues, which is a red flag). When you finally speak with a representative, and of course I cannot speak of all of them, most I’ve spoken with are rude and don’t even try to give you the best options for rebooking. They make ridiculous excuses for their mistakes as well.    Side note - I realize it is 100% my fault for booking this flight and knowing that it was UA, but I guess I hoped after flying Delta for the past 2+ years, things might have gotten better? Nope. Also, the one and only reason I flew with them before was because of airline miles with a credit card. I can’t believe this airline still exists. I will never fly with them again. One more note...Delta is a fantastic airline!! I would give them a 15 out of 10 if I could!"
Mar 2020,40,Trip to Steamboat,Flight there and back was excellent. Hayden is a small airport. Skis came right out.  Newark was a different story. Dozens of folks waiting for skis. All delivered to deepest  corner of the building. Only one person working. Horrible system.
Mar 2020,10,AIG SUCKS !!!!,I’m on the line for 3:39 hours and thirty nine minutes  And still no answer!!  Yes I GIVE UP !!!  1 - 10  -0 recommended
Mar 2020,30,United Polaris Businees Class,"Business class ""suites"" are roomy and comfortable. The Polaris Lounge was also very nice, much nicer than United's regular lounges. The food served on the flight, dinner and breakfast leaves a bit to be desired. They also have a serve yourself snack bar on the plane, that includes wine. That also left a lot to desire."
Mar 2020,30,Cape Town Airport,When we entered the x-ray area of the check-in process for our carry on bags it seemed a bit lax. They did not ask us to remove our shoes or liquids from our bags for inspection. The bags were just sent through the scanner and we went through x-ray on to customs area. We thought the inspection was brief but we assumed that was their policy. After we went through customs we purchased drinks and food for our flight home only to find out there was a second check point to search our bags for liquids that had to be discarded because the liquids could not be taken on the plane. Never in all my travels have I had to through away liquids I purchased inside the airport prior to boarding a flight. We were not told about this prior to our purchase or told liquids must be consumed prior to flight. There were no signs in the store or airport waiting area bags will be inspected for liquids or that liquids are not permitted past this point. It was very disappointing that our hard earned money we spent was wasted. Their policy needs to be updated and signs should be posted in the stores and waiting areas of the terminal that liquids will be confiscated prior to boarding the flight
Mar 2020,40,Round trip Charlotte to Paris,"My wife found some really cheap basic economy tickets to Paris. I was worried we'd be stuck in the luggage compartment, but it was just fine. It was the same as economy we just had to pay $60 per checked bag. The leg room was acceptable and I was able to sleep a good bit on the long haul portion from Dulles to Paris. My only complaint is that the food on United is not good. I usually fly Lufthansa to Europe and their food is much better."
Mar 2020,50,One of the best plane experiences,"My family and I have flown business class on several other airlines but United Polaris has topped all of them. Upon arriving at the airport there is a private lounge called the United Polaris lounge that provides amazing food before the flight as well as comfortable seating, shower lounges, sleep lounges and outlets.    Once we boarded the plane, there was Saks Fifth Avenue bedding laid out on our seats, which lay completely flat, as well as a memory foam mattress and a pillow for extra comfort, pajamas and a hygiene kit filled with stuff such as socks, a dental kit, hand lotion, post cards, etc. There was also a shelf to put your stuff on and a cabinet that had a water bottle in. On the seat there was an additional shoulder strap that helped to provide extra protection similar to that of a seatbelt.    During the flight, the dinner was spectacular but the breakfast kind of fell flat. which I ordered or a fruit plate that came with cereal. The omelette had a weird taste and a weird consistency but the side items that came with it were good. The flight attendants were amazingly attentive and friendly.    Overall, I would highly recommend investing in these seats as they are worth every penny for the luxury experience that United provided."
Mar 2020,50,Flight changes,United waived a change flight fee for a non-refundable ticket due to the COVID-19 emergency. The customer service was available by phone and most helpful to us especially being elderly.
Mar 2020,50,Great Experience,"The flights to Denver and Albuquerque were very quick and the landings were the best I've ever experienced. i didn't even know we had landed on 2 of the 4 landings. The pilots were great, the stewards were great too. The flight was so fast coming back that they barely had time to get us water.  I enjoyed the flight and how quick and safe it was. I like flying United!"
Mar 2020,50,SPECIAL MENTION FOR CHERYL MENIFEE,Thanks so much Cheryl Menifee (Lead customer service representative at SF Airport) for her kindness and professionnalism...  We’re well arrived in France !  Margot & William
Mar 2020,40,Chicago Ohare to Aruba,Wonderful experience in business class for my wife and I down to Aruba for our wedding/honeymoon. Crew did a wonderful job handeling all our needs. My wife carried on her wedding dress and they were able to put it in pilots closet for us. Will fly again on United to Aruba.
Mar 2020,10,WTF! UA charging large fees for restocking miles !,Why during this time of CoVid-19 is United Airlines charging large fees for restockng miles used to purchase tickets! At a time when people's pockets are empty UA is taking their money! Yet they want our taxes dollars to bail them out!!!!!
Mar 2020,10,Charged,Charged 250. For canceling our flight to Texas on March 27. Tried everything. Now I have to go through a refund policy.  All other hotels airlines and ticket venues gave back our money in full.  And with our tax money we our going to bailout this company.  I’ll never ever use this airline again.  If I had the virus would they refund us?
Mar 2020,10,Unclean flight in the mids of covid 19,As soon as we got to our seats 8A and 8B we realised that the plane was not cleaned. Tissue was still in the back of the seat in front of us. God knows what was on that tissue. Shame on united airlines.
Mar 2020,30,"Tight seats, adequate in all other respects","I'm 5'5"", so leg room is rarely in issue, but it was an issue on this flight. I couldn't recline knowing the person behind me was as squeezed as I was, so the whole flight was difficult. Plus, only half of the channels on my DirectTV worked, so I didn't even have the benefit of a good movie. But I arrived in one piece, so there's that."
Mar 2020,50,Visiting family,Catching up with family and friends. Had a great time. Weather was beautiful. The flight there and home was very comfortable and staff friendly and helpful
Mar 2020,10,Terrible Business Class,"I believe United has the worst business/first class of any airline. The service is bad, the stewardesses are not nice, there is zero entertainment unless you bring your own. Bathrooms are usually a mess. Do yourself a favor and travel business in any other airline but United."
Mar 2020,40,Escaping the Coronavirus in Portugal,"This flight was last-minute. Unplanned. We had planned on living in Lisbon until the end of May. But, as we watched the Coronavirus devastate Italy we watched for signs that Lisbon would be affected. Sure enough, the virus spread and we identified a growing likelihood that air travel would be restricted to the USA. So we called United and told them we wanted to depart in 48 hours.    Wow! They moved our flight from May 31 to March 13. Not only did they waive the change fee ($150/person), our United agent noted that our new flight was $71 cheaper -- and they would refund us that amount directly. Furthermore, we got seats in Economy Plus with an empty seat between us for the long TransAtlantic flight. Really nice, particularly as we, like most folks, were just a bit anxious about sitting next to others who might have contracted the virus.    Our overall rating for this trip is 5-star (Superb), which exceeds the rating of ""pretty good"" we usually observe of United Airlines. Thanks United!"
Mar 2020,50,Astounding service at United,"Waitting for my flight from Newark to Québec City I suddenly realised I no longer had the remote for my hearing aids. Absolutely no doubt in my mind, it fell out of my shirt pocket on my previous flight from Sao Paulo to Newark - the lie flat seats in business do not eliminate tossing and turning .. the remote is sirely on the seat of the 777 I left at Terminal C.    I thought, big plane, big airport, big companie ... so much for the $300 remote. But on the otherhand, what 5he heck, it can't hert to ask. So on March 18th 2020, at 08:30, I asked one of the gate 25 agents if it was possible to contact someone, on the off chance my remote might be found.    Not only did she contact someone but they found the remote and the agent from gate 25 walked to the otherside of the airport to pick it up and bring it to me just in time for my departure to Québec City.    I was so flabergasted by the service I never asked her name. But if she represents United customer services it is astoundingly good!"
Mar 2020,50,Consistently Excellent Customer Service,My family and I have enjoyed this flight numerous times over the last five years. The cabin crew is consistently attentive and friendly.  The vegan meals are excellent. Even my picky son eats all of the entrees on the vegan meals. The choice of movies is numerous with something for everyone.
Mar 2020,10,Home sweet home,"Well folks...these are troubled times, but UAL cancelled ALL flights out of Guatemala, 24 hours prior to the President of Guatemala shutting down all travel, and all borders.    I happened to be checking my Monday March 16th departure info very early on Sunday morning...at 5:30 am😉 WHEN I SAW that UAL had cancelled all flights. I took a two hour cab ride immediately to the airport, trying to get on any flight out. No luck.    No advance notice, no flight status updates, just the  sad shake of the counter attendants head...”so sorry”    So for any and all negative comments ~~~  IF YOU MADE IT HOME,  you WON THE LOTTERY!    Who knows when I get to go home😥😥😥"
Mar 2020,30,Equipment problems,Flight from Houston to Orlando delayed several times. Ended up being delayed almost 3 hours.should have decided to look for another airplane long before they did.houston is a hub. Flying seems like riding in a greyhound bus.
Mar 2020,10,Flying in a trash can,"We just returned from a trip to Israel on UA085 flight from Tel Aviv to Newark. The flight was indeed long but made even longer by the careless and uncaring flight attendants. The staff fed us soon after takeoff and that was it until an hour prior to landing. In using the restroom I was told by the attendant to use midship because the rear toilet was out of serviced. In doing that, I learned that sandwiches and water was set out midship. No announcement or alert to the passengers! Upon landing the entire cabin looked like a tornado had passed. There was trash and junk covering the floor and seats. Only once in this 12 hour trip did the staff come around to collect anything. On our trip to Israel aboard Swiss Air, the attendants came by hourly to offer water or service. And they smiled the entire time. On UA085, I rarely saw a smile except from the male attendants. The females looked as though we were an inconvenience and Burden. If at all possible, I will never fly United again but stay with American airline as usual."
Mar 2020,50,A trip to Fort Lauderdale from toronto and back made very enjoyable by the airline,"My wife and I had a scheduled event to attend in Florida and a few days to relax there, but the major snow storm across the central and northeast US threatened to cancel our plans--United without new charges re-routed us through Houston to overfly the worst weather and arrive as planned--the return flights through Washington were on time and very pleasant-service was friendly and professional on all four flights--I fly about 200,000 miles per year but my wife flies very little--She was delighted with United's service and that of course makes me happy lol!"
Mar 2020,10,Very stressful experience,"I have never had such a hard time checking in for my flight. We had a group of 4 and wanted to upgrade our seats and the employee that's was working her name was Danielle, was absolutely no help at all she told us it would prompt us on the kiosk and it did not, so we asked her at what point it would give us that option her response was ""I don't know maybe somewhere in the beginning"" so we asked if she could help us and she told us not to upgrade and said it would be $100 more per person which we where fine with and she said with an extreme eye roll and attitude ""why would you want to do that? What's the point in spending more money? You don't want to upgrade."" Then she just walked away. Her attitude got worse as she came back to tag our checked bags. We where willing to spend extra money and upgrade so we would be more comfortable and she would not let us and told us not to spend more money. Not sure why and employee would tell a customer not to spend any more money. Looks like we will be giving our money to delta or southwest for now on."
Mar 2020,40,Our overall experience,"Overall, the experience flying with United was acceptable. We checked in Pittsburgh Pa. at 5:00am and have NEVER been greeted by more RUDE employees like I was that morning. As I observed the employee, she was rude and and inconsiderate of the passengers asking questions. There were several employees punching in and I thought maybe this ONE employee was just overwhelmed and it WAS 5:00AM on Monday morning. I was wrong... they were just as bad if not worse. Not everyone is a frequent flyer!! Now when we left Sarasota, the United employees couldn't have been nicer. I commented on the horrible treatment we received in Pittsburgh!! THEY APOLOGIZED FOR THEM!! Obviously, they have heard that complaint before. I suggest United extend some PR for your employees. There is a lot going on in the world today. Be Nice! After all YOU are getting paid to assist! Please address this with your Pittsburgh employees!! I was not the only one treated disrespectfully!"
Mar 2020,40,Fly the Friendly Skies,"Flight was good.. Flight attendants were good. Easy on Easy off! Snacks were weak and cheap, disappointing."
Mar 2020,20,Not my favorite airline!,Typically one of the worst airlines in my experience and this flight was no different. The air crew was pleasant but the cramped seating and changes in ability to pick your seat continues to degrade this airline.
Mar 2020,30,Great Fare,Got an unbeatable fare. Flights were on time just hassle of having to check in your bags ( and pay extra ) also gate was changed in Chicago.  Based on fare and service would recommend.
Mar 2020,30,Arrived Home Early,"On Sunday, March 15, my wife and I (age 67) flew United from Santa Barbara to Grand Rapids, via Denver. We had changed our return home, which was to have been from San Francisco a week later. We made the change on line with no problem, United having waived change fees.  All three airports were somewhat busy, but not the worst we’ve seen. Some seemed to practice social distancing while others seemed unaware. None of the United personnel made any announcement to remind people, which could have been helpful.  Our flight from Santa Barbara was about 30 minutes late, due to an earlier delay of the aircraft, but we made our connection in Denver without a problem. The first flight was about 90% full,the second about 80%."
Mar 2020,10,Disrespectful to passengers,"I made a reservation using points to go away for a holiday with my wife. When Covid 19 first started, new seats became available in first class so I called to upgrade. They told me there were no more points seats but I could ""buy"" a 1st class ticket. Since it was my anniversary, I did. A week or so later Covid-19 got worse, St Thomas declared an emergency...and I called to cancel my flight. I was told my fare was Non refundable and I would be given a ""Credit"". I said wait, I was never told it was non refundable when I booked with the agent only a week ago. They were gruff, and non supportive...its called Bait and Switch. (My points ticket was refundable).    Bad service, surely staff...and not customer focused."
Mar 2020,20,"Expensive, basic and dated.","We bought what we though were an upgraded economy seat, approx $250 dollars for 2 of us. We expected a larger seat and additional service like you get with other airlines. We got a seat sat in front of the bulkhead with slightly more legroom... for $250 dollars! Absolute rip off.    We had also requested that the airline note my partners severe mushroom and fish allergy, we rang up after we booked, at check in, at the gate and lastly on the flight on boarding. Nobody knew about it and it came as a huge surprise to all every time we spoke. The air stewardess was rude and condescending about it when the food was being served. She suggested we have the Epi pen ready just in case, or at least use someone else's if it was required. My partner doesn't even have an Epi pen?! Plus what kind of advice is to use someones else's instead then?! We were absolutely raging on top of the seating issue.  The return flight was slightly better with more attentive staff. We sat in a normal seat with normal leg room in economy... still better than the upgrade $250 dollar seats! We will stick to other airlines when making our frequent trips to the States in the future."
Mar 2020,50,united airline || +1888-959-2011 || cheap ticket,"Best flight company so far, respect the customer. The united airline || +1888-959-2011 || cheap ticket company surprised me, I found the seats with a little more space. They served a good free meal, they were extremely attentive and kind. Everything they did for us to serve them well. Airplane in great condition."
Mar 2020,40,Nice experience,"This was our first experience flying as first class flyers. I enjoyed the experience! I had thought it would be a separate section but my husband told me they don't do that anymore on domestic flights. There is a curtain that separates you. I also believe the seats are a bit larger and the space between your seat and the ones in front of you have more space as they should.  The extra amenities are very nice, hot towels, beverages right away, hanging up your coat ( it was winter ), the meals etc. The only thing was that our dinner sandwich which was a wrap was still frozen on the inside.  Flight attendants were very nice to everyone!  Yes, first class is very pricey but to be honest, I was more comfortable and I wanted to avoid sitting next to someone's pet peacock since everyone is now flying with their livestock. I don't dislike animals or pets, but I don't want to be next to them on an airplane, bus or subway."
Mar 2020,40,Rude Flight Attendant,"I really like flying United Airlines and have been for the past five years for business. Everyone is treated with discretion and kindness by all employees. However, on this flight, the flight attendant had an attitude with just about everyone. If you don't like early morning flights, ask for a change. Issue: If someone is not following regulations (like how do passengers know them all), have the decency to talk to them politely and discretely.    Most people are a bit shy about asking for a seat belt extender. However, this flight attendant was loud and rude about it. Not cool! In addition her ""good mornings"" were disrespectful and sharp.    Most people don't realize that the seat belts are different lengths. So, a extender may be necessary because of bulky clothes or weight. Just be nice about it.    This young lady doesn't need to work with the public if she can't adjust her attitude on demand. Just saying...    I hope this was her first and last time in our area."
Mar 2020,50,Meetings in Vegas,Very comfortable seat & flight overall. Attentive staff. Nice selection of food & drink. Arrived & departed on time!
Mar 2020,50,Good deal,Flights were uneventful. Left on time both ways. Ticketing agents were very nice. Love the biscoff cookies!
Mar 2020,40,Good flight from Barcelona Spain to Newark New Jersey.,"Barcelona Spain is the worst airport! United only had 2 people checking us in, but there were about 500 of us in line. Many people missed their flights. It was very warm, and people were passing out and getting sick. It was terrible. But the flight was good, and very nice flight attendants, the food was awful!"
Mar 2020,10,JustFly.com Profits from COVID-19 Concerns!,"We booked our flight with United through JustFly.com. Due to COVID-19 concern, I had to cancel our trip and utilize the waiver for a flight voucher. JustFly is charging $75 fee for cancellation! Multiply that by all of the travelers trying to change flights or cancel, they are raking in the fees and completely taking advantage of their customers.    CDC and U.S. government advise us not to travel right now, and that's resulting in a profit for this horrible company. I called to dispute the fee and asked to talk to a supervisor. I was put on hold for 3 HOURS and 19 MINUTES before the call disconnected.    DO NOT USE JUSTFLY! I should have booked directly through United."
Mar 2020,30,Redeye smelly squeeze,Thought I would be able to pop an Adavan and sleep most of the flight but it was extremely noisy and the woman next to me decided to open up a vile smelling sandwich midflight waking me from a halfway decent sleep....maybe it's time that odors should be tested before being brought onto a plane....
Mar 2020,50,xcellent,"the flight went out as schedule, check in was smotth and in flight the staff was very accommodating."
Mar 2020,50,Wonderful Flight,"I recently traveled to Tokyo on United Airlines . The process was getting on and off the flight was smooth and efficient . The staff was very helpful and I saw several employees that spoke multiple languages . Once on board the planes was spotless and very new looking we were on the new Polaris model 777 ER . Fifty seats with lay down sleepers , then I saw a maroon section that had like 25 seats that were the standard first class chairs then coach . The flight attendants were very responsive and helpful speaking English and Japanese. They greeted the passengers with Champaign in first class . The pilots greeted the passengers and also took a person that was scared of flying onto the flight deck and showed them the plane. The flight went over the North Pole Russia and into japan . All in all a great flight and arrived early . Customs in Japan was easy and fast. With no delays the computer screening makes it easy and fast . Four hundred people were processed quickly."
Mar 2020,10,First class is a rip off!,"As we were travelling from Kauai to Toronto we thought we would upgrade to first class as it was an evening flight and the last part of our journey. We paid an additional $320 U.S for the upgrade. Yes, we had more leg room, a seat that was probably 21/2 inches wider, but it didn’t recline much more and wasn’t even that more comfortable. We were offered a drink three times and our refreshment consisted of a small package of potato chips or cookies. No meal, nothing hot, nothing. The tv was smaller than my economy flight with Delta and the movie selection was significantly smaller."
Mar 2020,40,Nice Flying,"I have had good experiences flying, nice movie choice. The only thing I suggest to United is having more options for headphones. I was not able to use my own headphones."
Mar 2020,50,Super comfortable,"Recent trip on a United 787 Dreamliner and it was the most comfortable flight I have ever been on. Top class service from the crew as well, and the Captain was very helpful in keeping everyone up to date with weather, turbulence etc... Will definitely travel with this airline again."
Mar 2020,50,Great experience despite early setback,On boarding in Manchester we had a 90 minute on board delay due to defective tyres. The staff looked after everyone and during the flight the staff worked hard bringing around food and drinks.  The airport at Newark is excellent and well run. Coming home they allowed us to check in early and relax in the huge lounge (air side). Prices in the airport are not excessive like the UK. Would DEFINITELY use UA again
Mar 2020,40,flight from Montreal to San Francisco,"flight in 2 'legs'. First from Montreal to Newark and Newark to San Francisco.  Montreal/Newark with an old Embrauer, Newark/San Francisco with a more decent B787-10, with 1 ½' ' loose space for my knees, that was magic ! Good entertainment system and as usual, horrible food. No free food for economy, no more cheese plate or pizza: what was left: an horrible hot dog with a funny tasting sauce, everything cooked in carton look paper. Tasted horrible, a deal at 16$ US.  I miss Lufthansa, Air France or Swiss... They have decent food."
Mar 2020,40,Excellent Service in the Sky.,"I always fly United because I belong to their airline miles program. I also use them because I always get excellent service. They also have T.V. screens on the seat in front so anyone can watch movies during their flight. I never sleep on a flight so I stay up enjoying the inflight entertainment. It takes my mind off of the long 10+ hour flights. I am also a vegetarian and appreciate the meal choices they give. Overall, I always choose United."
Mar 2020,10,"fraud, scam and lies","Your flight 9723 as you may know is operated by Swiss Air who e-mailed me on March 12th of the cancellation of my flight. Since this date ( 4 days now ), I have been left in limbo. Phone lines of both of you are blocked, web sites do not have any instruction or clarification on how and when customers will get their refund. If this is the way two big companies are doing their business then good luck America. My refund is the responsibility of you, Swiss Air and Cheap tickets. Stop humiliating your customers and start treating them in dignity and respect and most importantly stop the fraud and scam. Return my money corporate america."
Mar 2020,20,Guaranteed to probably be late. Inconsistant service quality,"The United flights are so unreliable, and so often late, that I travel the day before my connecting flight and stay in a hotel.  Sometimes you encounter a really helpful and friendly staff member, but sometimes you don't; they really need to sort that issue out.  The seats now are so ridiculously close together that they no longer line up with the windows so forget reclining the seat you will hit the person behind you.  I used the automatic check in and got the wrong seat class and I was charged for my baggage that I had already paid for. Still trying to get a refund."
Mar 2020,50,"I flew with UA on March, 10th to Washington, and next to San Diego.","I was glad I arrived in the States before the restrictions, taken to fly to America, with the Corona virus. I only stayed 4 days in San Diego, and hurried back home. Before I couldn't fly anymore to Europe!  My daughter in San Diego contacted UA through Connections, and they helped me looking for a good flight as soon as possible to return to Belgium.  But we didn't like to wait that long, so she booked an online flight with UA on March, 14th.  Connections gave me the site to see if UA can take measurements to finance this extra flight?"
Mar 2020,10,The worst flight experience of my life,"After an exhausting 15 hr flight from Sydney Australia to San Francisco, our next leg from SF to Chicago was booked in Economy Plus. Aswe boarded the plane we found that we had been bumped by two United Airline employees to the last row of seats. These were non-revenue passengers that bumped.  Our seats would not recline and my knees were in constant contact with the seat in front of me. We were also directly in front of the lavatory which was in constant use,  I believe this shows complete arrogance on the part of these employees. I am further of the opinion this illsutrates a total disdain for the flying public by UAL.  We paid for the upgrade and the seats were confirmed in January.  No more UAL for me. This could happen to anyone."
Mar 2020,50,Roomy and smooth flight,We were rescheduled to this flight as our first flight was cancelled and what luck because we were able to get home in comfort. There was plenty of leg room and they offered us a lot of snacks. We would fly internationally with United again.
Mar 2020,30,The best protection is self protection,"After I boarded and was seated another passenger came down the aisle and seated himself immediately across the aisle from me (I was in an aisle seat and so was he). He was coughing heavily and his breathing was very labored. He also seemed to be perspiring. I asked him to please move back a few rows. He cussed at me but did so. Since there was no attendant around, and there was an empty aisle seat a few rows from where I was seated, I moved up the aisle and took a new seat. Just an example of self-help."
Mar 2020,10,Gold memmber,"I got a bad service with less than 50 percent occupancy the rule is the united airlines crew members are never take care the passengers,"
Mar 2020,30,Tiring,My trip here was uneventful but was before the Virus problem so nothing I say will not be relevant to any flight you will be taken now.
Mar 2020,10,Worst cus,"This is the WORST airlines by far and the cheap tickets are not worth the absolute terrible service. The customer service agent hung up the phone on me mid conversation while trying to get my flight changed after a 2hr wait time to speak to a representative. Additionally, on the flight here the flight was in air for 3 hours and then had to turn around back to our original departure airport due to a technical error. Throughout this process the flight attendants were incredibly rude and unaccommodating during an extremely time sensitive situation. The flight was delayed over 15 hours. This is the absolute worst airline I have ever traveled on and would recommend anyone to never travel United and if they are the only option then to not travel at all. I would not wish the time, cost, and emotional suffering I have had to face even on my worst enemy. Extremely disappointed."
Mar 2020,10,$125 REDEPOSIT FEE,Just wanted everyone to know that United is charging $125 to redeposit miles into your Mileage Plus account for cancellations resulting from the Corona Virus outbreak. Paid tickets have no charges or penalties. I think this is disgraceful and they are totally taking advantage of a situation that is out of people's control. Nice way to reward your frequent flyers United.
Mar 2020,40,good flight,"after some time again on united, not a long flight just under two hours but on time, good Boarding, flight was quite empty so you could move around and we had both aisle seats nobody by us, Basic Service drink and a small salty Snack. app for movies works but not the a very good choice of movies or TV. Overall as it was connecting flight for us we arrived on time and our luggage made it."
Mar 2020,10,Poor customer service,"Customer service is way below par for business class airlines. Food is below standards. Our flight was delayed by 18 hours we reached EWR at mid night, they gave us connecting flight boarding passes and didn't checked n bags and asking us to drop off another terminal. We went through multiple small elevators to get to baggage drop only to find empty counters for 3hours. For our inconvenience we were given 20$ voucher.highly inconvenient will not recommend this airlines for international Traveller and especially for elderly parents travelling alone"
Mar 2020,50,AWESOME,"excellent great food great movies great staff AAAAAAA++++++++ Best flight ever best way to go you can use your moles only 35,000"
Mar 2020,10,Avoid United at ALL costs - seriously.,"Currently stranded in Barcelona waiting to go home to the states. United canceled our booking, never notified us, and never gave us a refund. We had to find out that United canceled our booking through a Lufthansa worker. Thats how terrible United’s customer service is. The poor Lufthansa attendant went through hoops to help us, while United refused to help.    Every other time my flight has been canceled (through any airline besides United), we were offered valid explanations, refunds, and or a change in flight. United just ignored us and offered zero help. You’d think during a global pandemic they would want to get their customers home, but they dont care.    Avoid United at all costs. I know for sure I will never fly with them again. Absolutely reprehensible vultures. Hopefully you dont have a bad experience like I did. Book a different airline."
Mar 2020,10,Horrible,"It was miserable, uncomfortable, rude, and the service was horribly treated, asked about charging my phone was told they weren't available in my section yet it was available 2 rows in front of me. good price no quality and poor service."
Mar 2020,50,Got It Right,My family and I were flying from MPLS into a West Palm Beach to board a cruise to Nassau for 2 nights. It just so happened that the cruise was going to take us to Nassau but was not going to come back for us after our 2 night stay. Our cruise essentially put us in a dilemma less than 24hrs before we boarded our plane! United picked it up and was able to get us a flight from Nassau to MSP complimentary. You guys are the real MVP. Thank you for all that you do.
Mar 2020,20,Mr. William Cook,Terrible overall cleanliness in plane and general conditions  Of the interior of cabin . Seats where dirty and had a strange odor. Would recommend intense cleaning every other flight .
Mar 2020,50,Colorado or Bust,"With the United CC, there are extras provided that make almost every flight special. My United was ON time leaving the gate 5 minutes early and plenty of overhead space. Flight attendants were very professional and had been with United for many years. Quick service, tail winds and arriving early to an open gate, does not get much better! Coming back was equally as great!"
Mar 2020,10,"Don’t trust (they cancel
My flight but charge me)","I booked a family vacation far in advance. And United actually canceled my flight, not me but they changed my flight and gave me an alternate option that did not work for me. When I chose an alternate airport that suited my schedule better I was attempted to be charged fees and even though I was driving seven hours to take that other flight it was cheaper so I was OK with it but they were not going to credit me the difference. Unbelievable. I will continue to be a Delta customer and I should have never And United actually canceled my flight, not me but they changed my flight and gave me an alternate option that did not work for me.

Unbelievable. I will continue to be a Delta customer and I should have never Even tried united"
Mar 2020,40,Flying in these times,Seems that airline reduced plane size due to fewer passengers. All travelers and flight attendants acted respectfully and responsibly.
Mar 2020,30,2 late departures,"Recently used United Airlines to fly to Cancun, via Houston and Jacksonville, Fl. Both flights were late departing so it worked out fine for arrival in Cancun."
Mar 2020,30,Don't fly the basic econ flight.,"Now the airlines are offering a ""basic economy flight"" in addition to the basic flight. The price is the best but the services are terrible. You are not allowed to carry-on luggage,only one personal item and the price for checking the luggage was $30 each way so add $60 and the chance of losing your luggage. Then you are offered a price for a seat. I didn't pay it feeling that I already paid for a seat and those offered are not the best. If you have a long way to go, you get a middle seat which is difficult. You board last and don't get any attention from air attendants. It is miserable, uncomfortable and cheesy."
Mar 2020,50,Smooth Easy Trip,"Flew through Denver and everything was on time coming and going, friendly staff on land and in air, couldn't have been better."
Mar 2020,40,Good Flights,United is usually on time and has good flights. This particular flight was delayed because of weather which worked to my advantage. United always has their act together and boarding is quick and easy. I always fly United and have had good luck. I would recommend for their on time schedules and level of service.
Mar 2020,40,OUR FLIGHT,"PERSONNEL IN AIRPORT AND on flight were Fabulous. As I do not fly alot, I was very surprised how you tightly fit into these seats. Flight was completely booked, its winter with everyone wearing heavy coats we were a bit cramped. Flight was smooth with No problems. As we were unable to pay for an upgrade to our seat or pick our seat, as we were flying with a group. I also would suggest that the last row be allowed to get on to the plane first so they do not hold up everyone else trying to get to their seats"
Mar 2020,30,Did Not Feel United,"United flying to Denver from Oregon was a nightmare. Landed at A77 while my connecting flight to Cancun was boarding at B35. That's right. If you know Denver airport, that was a full sprint, train ride and more flat out running to catch the connecting flight. Poor experience. Airplanes were old, cramped, and dirty. Not a pleasant experience."
Mar 2020,50,Can'y say enough how helpfull they were,"My wife had suffered a fall resulting in a severe sprained knee and ankle prior to our flight home to Edmonton from a cruise in the Caribbean. On arrival at the Ft. Lauderdale airport, our motor coach driver summoned a United agent to bring a wheel chair to the motor coach for my wife. From that moment on, we were treated with respect by agents in Ft. Lauderdale, Houston and Edmonton. Wheel chairs were provided by pleasant and professional United Airlines agents at each airport. We can't thank United enough for their kind attention to my wife's needs."
Mar 2020,10,Airline changes flight but charges me fees,"Airline decides to change flight but because what THEY chose to replace me with wasn’t acceptable, they charge me fees  Highly recommend using delta instead  They would have accommodated"
Mar 2020,50,Great Overall Experience,"Our flight departed early and arrived early, our 3 bags were nearly the first ones off, only real problem was the hard stand disembarkation.    My wife broke her leg in December and by mid -Feb departure she was still using crutches. United arranged for a wheelchair at our PVR destination which worked very well. The hard stand required my wife to go down stairs with trepidation, but we were met on the tarmac with a wheelchair and sailed through immigration and customs."
Mar 2020,50,Ms,"Outstanding service!!!!! I always satisfied with their service, and delicious food.  I love you United Airline 😘😘"
Mar 2020,50,Agent to the rescue,Flying to Cabo in February out of Denver. Had a connection in LAX. We had taxied out for takeoff when a fog bank rolled into LA. After sitting for quite awhile we were told that LA was not allowing flights in. We were going to miss our connection. The only other flight to cabo from LA that day would not arrive until the following afternoon. The plane went back to the gate. We got off and hustled to United's customer service on the concourse. The Agent was able to rebook us on a direct flight out of Denver that arrived in Cabo 15 minutes later then our original flight. Vacation saved
Mar 2020,50,Good Flight,"The flight was very pleasant with a professional, friendly flight crew. The food was very good and offered inflight entertainment. Flying into Houston was surprising easy and I can’t say enough good things about customs."
Mar 2020,50,Pretty Bumpy But Pilot Did A Great Job With The Landing,"Pilot and airline attendants did a great job on this flight as we hit some pretty bad turbulence as we began our descent. Prior, everything was fine except for one of the attendants who was testy and rude as we were trying to assist a speech impaired passenger who wanted a waffle cookie."
Mar 2020,30,"United to Maui. Safe, Effective, Direct Flight. Food and Entertainment disappointing","Interesting tidbit, you're stuck on a plane for 7-8 hours that don't have any movie screens. You had to download an app real quick on your phone/tablet to watch movies on United network. Same old airline crap Food For Purchase. Eat before hand."
Mar 2020,40,Surprisingly good flight!,"We chose United Airlines because of the cheap flight, had read bad reviews online about the food but we were pleasantly surprised. The quality was okay even though dessert was always ice cream and the white bread rolls were awful. The quantity of food, however, was a bit lacking and we spent a bit of the flights feeling hungry. We’ll be better prepared on the return flights with sandwiches and snacks in hand luggage! Having said all that about the food, the flights were on time and we’d definitely travel with them again despite the two hours it took to get through Houston for our flight to Sydney,"
Mar 2020,40,In flight Service,Airline service is becoming more and more basic. Crew was polite and efficient if perfunctory. Things are becoming very minimalist these days.
Mar 2020,10,Items Missing From Bag - Airlines should take responsibility for theft when your bag is in their care,"When I retrieved my suitcase from United, I was missing several items out of the outer zipper compartment including a hair straightener, several toiletries, and my electric toothbrush.    I claimed the missing items, and received payment for the toiletries, but was told United doesn't cover ""electronics"", but would offer me a $100 travel voucher instead. I called to explain that I was not interested in a travel voucher as compensation because I was still out a $100 toothbrush, but they wouldn't update their offer.    SO - if you ever have an ""electric"" anything stolen and need to make a claim, I suggest you lie and call it a $100 face cream so the value is reimbursed.    OR - don't fly with United. This policy is ridiculous and this airline should take responsibility for theft when your bag is in their care. Not only was my suitcase rifled through, but I had to go through a long claims process, only to find I was not going to be properly reimbursed."
Mar 2020,40,Smooth. uneventful flight.,Always fly United; good frequent flyer program. Flights are usually either on time or slightly early and most attendants are helpful to disabled travelers.
Mar 2020,30,14 hour flight,Went smoothly. Facilities were good. Lots of movies. Plane was changed and so could not get left foot on aisle which is better for my disability but I did have an aisle seat service fine. Vegetarian ovo lacto breakfast was disappointing but okay.
Mar 2020,30,What a PITA,"What a pain in the neck. We were on standby for First Class. We are already United Plus members with seats booked in premium economy and boarding 2nd seating. Just seconds before we started boarding, they called us up for our standby to First Class change. However, we were not seated anywhere near each other so we declined. The United person got miffed and tried to talk us into taking it saying maybe we could get others to switch seats with us, but what if we couldn't? We we insisted that if we could not be together for certain, we did not want to change to first class and to give us our old seats back. No big deal right? Wrong. By this time the flight was boarding and it took forever for her to re-book us back into our original seats, only now they had us listed as boarding 4th seating. Remember, we had paid for upgraded seats and are United Plus members so we are supposed to get 2nd seating. I complained and she went ahead and put us through in second seating but she let us know she was not happy about it.  I swear every time we fly that I am done with United but since we are United Plus members, and that entitles us to one free checked baggage each as well as 2nd seating, we stay with them. But they really don't give two hoots about making their customers happy."
Mar 2020,50,end of a nice vacation,"staff was very professional , courteous and friendly even though it was a very  early morning flight!  I would fly United Airlines any day"
Mar 2020,10,"False Advertising, Waived fees, and rebooking (Bait and Switch)","Because of this crazy time, I am considering changing a scheduled flight that I have with United airlines. I paid $262 for my original flight. If I cancel the flight, I can bank the $ for 12 months and rebook at at later date. That sounds great, doesn't it?  Well, I looked into it and this is what would happen. If I rebook on the very same flight and use my banked $, United airlines says ""magnanimously"" that they will waive change fees. However, United airlines will charge $545 for the rebooked flight (the very same as the original) they ""use"" the banked $ and still charge $283 more for the exact same flight.  I tried booking a different flight in the future. If I booked this flight without wanting to use my ""banked""$, it would cost $350. If I book this new flight using my banked $ United airlines will charge $1500!!    THIS IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY!! UNITED AIRLINES IS TRYING TO PRESENT THIS COMPASSIONATE PUBLIC IMAGE, AS IF THEY REALLY CARE AND WANT TO HELP IN THIS CRISIS. IN REALITY THEY REDUCE YOUR BANKED $ TO BE ALMOST WORTHLESS.    UNITED AIRLINES, YOU NEED TO TAKE A LESSON FROM SOUTHWEST, THERE POLICY ""ALL THE TIME"" IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT TRAVEL PLANS CHANGE AND ALLOW TRAVEL FUNDS TO BE BANKED FOR 12 MONTHS AND THEN USED AS THEIR ORIGINAL VALUE.    UNITED AIRLINES IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A VERY SCARY TIME AND PROFITING FROM IT!!"
Mar 2020,10,Very disappointed with flight crew. They could not have cared less about us. Male hit me with beverage cart,"We have been flying United for 40 years and it just keeps getting worse. Planes are filthy and the flight attendants are rude and don’t serve you or care about you. This plane was nicer than the first leg. The BIGGEST problem on this plane was that the attendants did not enforce the rule of all window shades UP during takeoff and landing. It’s an important safety issue, plus causes anxiety at an extreme level. I mentioned it to the lead attendant and she was mean and scary, did not want me talking to the pilots. I did talk to them and they understood my concerns but they did not know United’s policy on the window shades. Looking at other airlines in the future. Too many recent horrible experiences."
Mar 2020,50,It’s all about Business,"I was fortunate enough to travel in business class on United flight UA2 from Singapore to San Francisco. My flight attendant was Judy. From the moment she started introducing herself to the passengers in my section I new she was going to provide exceptional service. She was enthusiastic, constantly smiled, and attentive to all. Every time I left the seat my water glass was topped off upon my return and any rubbish was removed. Typically in business class you get good service but hers was exceptional and made each person feel appreciated! Excellent job Judy and United! Global Guy!"
Mar 2020,10,Unfair Practice,"I booked a first class round trip ticket, which consisted of 4 legs. Unbeknownst to me, one leg of the trip was booked in a fare basis that is non-refundable, even though I was charged a first class fare for the ticket. This is the highest priced ticket. When I needed to cancel the reservation, I was informed that the entire ticket was non-refundable, because the one leg of the trip was booked in a non-refundable fare basis. I was not informed of this hidden rule when I booked the trip. This is an unfair practice."
Mar 2020,50,GREAT FLIGHT,Great take off and landing. Pleasant cabin attendants. Reliable flight schedule.  Our flight did not have entertainment. Bring your own food.
Mar 2020,40,Great service and nice food in First Class,"I stopped using United about 8 years ago when they twice threw away around 25,000 points each time. They claim not to throw away points any longer, so we'll see. I had to take United from Costa Rica to Seattle in March. The flight was nice and smooth, except for natural bumpy air patterns occasionally. Compared to other American airlines that I take fairly frequently, I was pleasantly surprised at how genuinely caring the attendant was. She was very tuned in to us passengers, gave very thorough answers to our questions, and kept us well cared for. The food was good, though I hope someday they will get organic, or at least non-GMO, food. It was the best food I've had on any other American airlines."
Mar 2020,40,United Call Center 1 800 864 8331 worked perfectly,"In the middle of COVID 19 pandemic trying to cancel our tickets with United. Left a note on their web site, as calling was impossible - I imagine the number of people trying to cancel their flight plans.  United waived fees for changes or cancellations, great! Their call center contacted me (!!), the person was super friendly, apologized for not being able to do it faster (indeed, it took 2 days). They explained all the rules to me, and managed to cancel my tickets right away, without putting me through the misery of holding for hours again (not their fault).  Four stars only for the fact that they didn't create a user-friendly system of cancelling online, with clear explanations - unlike, say, Alaska Air did (we had to cancel their tickets, too, took 2 minutes with no unanswered questions at all)."
Mar 2020,40,Decent flight,"Comfortable full recline seats. Food leaves much to be desired. Ran out of snacks, not even nuts. Lounge in SFO is very nice. So so service."
Mar 2020,50,Good Flight,"On time, smooth flight, went as expected. Plane was clean, flight attendants friendly. Good landing, went immediately to gate."
Mar 2020,10,Traveling to Japan during corona incident,"So while this incident is worsening, i requested a refund because the chance of becoming a carrier of the corona virus is high. I contacted united airlines and they told me i will receive a refund for the flight. Here i am 12 days later and they said I cannot receive my refund based on fare rules. The CDC suggests people should not travel to japan as it is a level 2 zone. But United is being stingy. I will not be using united again"
Mar 2020,50,Great As Usual,"I have great luck with this airline. The staff is typically friendly, the planes clean, the flights on time. I like United and will continue to fly this brand."
Mar 2020,40,United Airlines,"It was a great experience. Cabin attendants are helpful, flight is smooth, and the transfer from Tokyo Narita to Denver, & from Denver to Las Vegas was smooth. Definitely will fly United again!"
Mar 2020,40,"Excellent Service, until they left my bag in Newark","Deciding to get away from the stress of England's winter weather, we decided to get away from it all in Cancun. Originally we were going to Florida, so this was a hastily arranged change of destination. United Airlines had business class flights available, with a stop over in Newark New Jersey.    The check-in was good. The business class cabin was roomy and the equipment available in the cabin was extensive. The entertainment system was impressively varied and kept me fully occupied during the flight.    The food was uniformly excellent on the flight and champagne was flowing. The cabin staff were very attentive and we were well looked after very well during this flight.    We got to Newark and the immigration process was better than Miami airport the year before. As usual for all passengers transiting through almost all US airports, we picked up our suitcases and walked to the bag drop off point. My wife decided, without thinking, to remove the sticker on her suitcase. Little did I know the knock on effect that decision would cause me once I reached our final destination. I dropped my suitcase off and we went to one of the customer service desks to get a replacement sticker for her suitcase. They issued us with new tickets and a new sticker for her suitcase and dropped the suitcase off.    I don't understand why American airports don't have international transfer facilities, like many other airports around the world. The fact you have to go through the full arrivals process again is incredibly annoying and wastes a lot of time.    Anyway, the business lounge for UA in Newark is incredible. The food and service was impeccable and the friendly staff couldn't do enough to make us feel comfortable. We were seriously impressed.    The flight to Cancun was on a smaller aircraft and, like most short haul flights, had no entertainment onboard and the food was adequate. The staff were very friendly.    On arrival in Cancun we waited to pick up our bags. After 40 mins of watching many suitcases getting picked up, including my wife's, I realised my suitcase was not there. I spoke to the UA baggage manager and got a serial number to track the case (no pun intended) number. I had used the new ticket issued at boarding and UA's system was showing I had not checked in (using the old ticket which was referenced on the sticker on my suitcase), so my suitcase wasn't loaded on to the flight. Despite constant daily calls to the airline and assurances and promises that the bag would be delivered the next day, it took my wife to e-mail the CEO and director of Customer Services at UA to get the bag delivered.    To be fair to UA, once the case was escalated, the suitcase arrived at the resort within 14 hours and I could finally start relaxing and enjoying the holiday. It did take over 3 days to receive the suitcase thought and during this time I spent a lot of money on clothes at the resort. On returning to the UK I put a claim in and this was promptly paid.    Overall, if my suitcase had not had a holiday itself in Newark, I would have rated the airline experience as excellent. The service on the flights was great and the exceptional quality of the buisness lounge in Newark is something to experience.    I would recommend United Airlines to anyone wishing to fly business class."
Mar 2020,50,Exceptional service in traveling with a pet,"We traveled for vacation with our small dog (not a service dog) under the seat in front of us. From the time we called with the reservation to make it known we were travleing with a pet, to check-in at the airport, to counter assistance, to staff on the plane - EVERYONE was phenomenal. I could not believe how many people came up to us to offer assistance or ask if we knew where we needed to, etc..... Highly recommend this experience with United, if you are traveling with a small pet."
Mar 2020,50,Very good experience!,"We have been flying for many years. Always traveled basic economy. We decided to fly first class (business class). It is more expensive but I will never look back. The flight attendants treated us just terrific. The bells and whistles are worth the extra money. From the food and drinks, and that I actually enjoyed sitting in a seat that wasn't so tight and cramped. I highly recommend. Will do again!"
Mar 2020,20,Stuck overnight!,"Going to Neward NJ, the plane was packed and there is little leg or head room so I thank God that I paid the outrageous price of an aisle seat or I would have been incredibly uncomfortable.    We got stuck in Newark NJ overnight and had to pay for extra food and accommodations with each of us only recieving a $20 voucher. Have you ever had to buy food at the Newark airport? $20 may buy you a glass of wine. I think it is important for you to know that United does not take any responsibility for your situation when they can claim ""weather delays that timed out the crew"".....    Air travel with this carrier is not for the feint of heart or for those who cannot afford to dig deeper into their pockets to take care of themselves....We met numerous travelers on that flight that had to sleep on the floor of the airport with a blanket they could only obtain at customer service."
Mar 2020,50,Great Flight,Everything about this flight was good. The check-in went smoothly and the actual ride on the airplane was comfortable and seem to pass by quickly. I love that it's Non-Stop. I actually live near Buffalo but it was a lot cheaper to fly into Cleveland. Cleveland is the nice Airport and we had stayed on the way down at a hotel that allows you to park your car there and give you transportation to and from the airport while you're on your trip. It was really nice and I would highly recommend it.
Mar 2020,30,Why a 3+ Hour Layover And a Switch in Terminals at Houston International?,"Flew from El Paso to Philadelphia, via Houston. Flights were fine. However I had a 3+ hour layover in Houston. Why was that?    Also,my flight was originally supposed to leave from Gate C35. However, without any explanation - and I did ask Customer Service - the flight was moved to terminal B. The airport does not have electric walkways and I had difficulty in traversing the distance between terminals C and B. Again, allow me to stress that no explanation was forthcoming about the change!"
Mar 2020,10,My flight got cancelled and they charged me full price for the flight then then booked me on. They didn't let me know,1. My flight got delayed  2. My flight got cancelled  3. They re-booked me on another flight  4. I found out 2 weeks later when I looked at my credit card statement that they charged me $388.80 for this re-booked flight  5. I had to pay $400 for a hotel (cheapest I could find)    When I brought this up with customer servie they did nothing. This company across every division I have spoken too in the last two weeks lacks respect or any understanding of customer service. I will never fly with United ever again and if you want to be treated with any respect I suggest you don't either.
Mar 2020,40,good,"Flight was good , good airplane , good service and a smooth flight . Food was OK but no more than that. Due to Corona virus plenty of space in the aircraft"
Mar 2020,50,Excellent Flight & Service,Excellent flight and service on both flights to and from Raleigh back to Houston. This was a smaller plane so it didn't have the in flight entertainment but they did provide WIFI and you could use your own phones/laptops/ipads.
Mar 2020,40,Quick and easy,"Pushed back a minute or two early and got into Denver about as early. Great crew! Crowded seating, of course. The aircraft was clean and fairly new."
Mar 2020,30,Phoenix comming back,"The flight was delayed at the last minute, they moved me to a later one which can challenge my connection to PTY. Also I did a piece through the app. My bags arrived ok to pty. Not sure what happened but at the counter the members were trying to resolves all people issues."
Mar 2020,20,Empty Promises,"Our flight from Dulles to Honolulu and back again required four segments. The morning of each flight, I checked the United web site to verify what entertainment would be provided. In each instance, the report was that seat back entertainment would be provided. United does indicate that services could change. In 3 our of the four segments, there was no seat back entertainment. Of those, 1 flight could not even get their wifi to work properly. I could understand an occasional last minute change in aircraft that causes a drop in service but 75% of the time? I think we should expect more for the high price we paid for those airline tickets. In full disclosure, the 1 segment that did deliver was a 787 Dreamliner that was by far the nicest, most comfortable, and quietest airplane I have ever been on."
Mar 2020,50,Great Flight,Received an email the night before to upgrade our seats for free to the extra leg room seats. First time ever receiving this and it was a great reward for doing all the travel I do on United. I recommend getting their credit card so you get free checked luggage and earn points.
Mar 2020,10,Stranded and delayed as usual with United Airlines. Not weather related fault,Don’t waste your money. Our flight was canceled and rescheduled more than three times due to technical difficulties. We were stranded on the island and they didn’t care. Finally after more than 24 hours we made it on a plane. They offered us $200 airline credit to make up for it???!!! Like that covers taxis hotel childcare etc. We paid for upgraded seats on original booking and I still don’t have that refunded. The charger outlets didn’t work in our entire row. The row we paid to be in! First leg of our flight was 9 hours because we were stuck on the plane for an hour before even taking off. They didn’t offer any food we could just pay for a cheese snack box.    3 out of the last 3 American flights I have taken have been delayed and the outlets didn’t work for charging. Don’t do it!
Mar 2020,50,An excellent red-eye flight.,This was a red-eye and was quite a nice flight. The crew were helpful at all times. I would recommend a red-eye for international travel if one has the choice. We arrived in Chicago in the morning and were through immigration quite quickly. We were able to make surface transport connections easily. It was an excellent travel experience.
Mar 2020,20,Filthy Bathroom,"Although the virus Covid19 had not kicked into high gear, the effect of the virus was still well known. Unfortunately, United did not make any changes in the cleaning and hygiene of the aircraft. In particular, the bathroom was worse than disgusting. No toilet paper, no paper towels, and foul smelling were a few of the issues."
Mar 2020,20,Missing baggage at Kwajalein Is.,"I took this flight to work on a mission on Ebeye Is. in Marshall Is.for about 1 month. The flight has to land at Kwajalein Military base + then by sea to Ebeye.In Guam some baggage had to be removed to balance the weight of fuel before take off via several other Micronesian Is. Passengers are not allowed to stay on Kwaj. so when I landed minus bags I was dispatched to the ship for Ebeye after being told to come + check after 3 days. Once off Kwaj. you are not allowed back there unless you have an onward flight! Hence no way to come back.No recompense was paid for this as no clothes,and daily necessities were provided. This was October + the fear of losing or delaying bags on Kwaj.is unlike any other place I""ve ever been to in the last 50 years.I got eventually thanks to one of my staff having i brother working on the base."
Mar 2020,40,On par with major airlines,"Took this flight as the flight time fitted our schedule depature to get us into Houston around midday . There was nothing to complain about , staff were courteous, it was on time and and service aboard good. Onboard the plane was clean and amenities welled stocked. On arrival bags were out on carousel promptly. All in all nothing stood out as good or bad andwould fly with again , no problems there."
Mar 2020,40,Newark to Frankfurt,This round trip vacation was booked through United Airlines but we flew to Frankfurt on a Lufthansa jet and returned on a United jet. It was confusing at the airport at first because we weren’t aware that The whole trip was done through United...also because of this we had trouble booking our seats ahead of time online...I’m glad we got to the airport early....hence the 4 stars instead of 5....otherwise both flights were great and both airlines were great....  I would say that the food was better on the United but the service and comfort was about equal on both
Mar 2020,40,Good Flight-No Delays or Issues,"My husband and I took the red-eye from Kauai to San Francisco. Although I didn't like taking an overnight flight, United did a very good job and all went exactly as I expected. We had no delays and the flight went as planned. We had premium seating which is always nice as you get to board earlier and you have extra legroom."
Mar 2020,10,Bathrooms in row 7 and 8,"Don't get seats right next to the bathroom as the smell is terrible. There is a constant flow of people coming to your seats, that used to be prime seats.  I'll make sure to look at the plane diagram before I eagerly pick the seats in rows 7 or 8. Never again!"
Mar 2020,40,Surprisingly good,"My first time flying United to Paris, the flight was very nice, they served us a nice meal and the flight attendants were very friendly and attentive to my needs."
Mar 2020,40,The Line-up,"The line to get in was VERY long. Add an extra hour if going near mid-day. Flight itself was good. Stewardess was friendly, got orders correct. No hassles. Smooth takeoff and smooth landing.    In Seattle, picked up The Tattooist of Auschwitz and the bookstore had a ""read and return"" policy of a 50% refund. Great concept."
Mar 2020,40,Decent enough but seats are very narrow,"We purchased premium economy seats for the extra legroom and the legroom was very good. The width of the seats was very narrow. Very uncomfortable when the row is three seats wide and you are the one in the middle! There was enough room for our carry on bags, which is a relief. I think United did a good job by having the different price points for their seats. The least expensive seats to not allow for carry on bags and this leaves more room for everyone else. The food offered for sale was okay. Staff was pleasant. The Wi-Fi connection offered on the plane did not work well enough to be able to enjoy the free movies offered on one's own personal device, using their app. That was disappointing but most other airlines have no internet service from the mainland to Hawaii. The flights ran mostly on time with just minor delays."
Mar 2020,40,Weather Delays,"So I received one notice before I got to the airport that my flight was delayed. I got another when I arrived at McCarran. The United Staff at the check-in desk needed to work on their customer service for sure (they were cross and just angry). However the gate staff went above and beyond. They happily answered questions and kept everyone in the loop regarding the delay and what was going on. They brought out a snack tray and when our 1:48p flight was delayed until 6, good vouchers for dinner were passed out. Then we found out we would need a new crew. The old crew for our plane (after it finally arrived) took the time to get on the loudspeaker and tell us what was going on and apologize. They boarded us before the new pilots had arrived and once they were there and went through their preflight checks we were on our way. The cabin crew was a slight rude, but I assume that was because they had not expected to have to fly such a late flight. The pilots kept us all informed and made up some time on the way back to DC. Not the best experience but United did there best to make it better."
Mar 2020,40,"Long flight Hawaii to CT, 3 segments",Long flights in 3 segments . Flight attendants were very pleasant and efficient in performing their duties.
Mar 2020,30,High price for a cheap seat,"Pretty sad when you have to drive 2 and half hours to get decent flight times and then pay a price that you could of gone across the pond. Uncomfortable seats as usual, dirty. Only bright side was they didn’t loose are luggage and the fact we went before all this virus outbreak occurred or should I say went public."
Mar 2020,40,better than expected flight,"Very comfortbale seating, with excelent service and good food (breaskfast). Despite that the plane was diverted just before takeoff from the runway amid maintenance issues (some lights in the cockpit), the plane got really back on track without the aid of external persons, and we maneged to get off almost in time."
Mar 2020,50,"How forthcoming of an airline in need to get home,","We were stuck in Melbourne, as Xiamen Airlines had to cancel out flight. All Chinese planes, incoming or outgoing were banned from flying. We were shocked but luckily United accommodated us with our checked luggage which we would have had on the Xiamen airlines, which we found also very good and helpful. We are lucky to be helped by United who were very curteous and accommodating. I would fly with them again."
Mar 2020,10,Flight from Hell!,"This was a flight from hell! we boarded our flight, left the terminal, only to sit on the tarmac for 40 minutes, the captain comes on and tells we have a slight problem and will be returning to the terminal. We sit another 30 minutes and then finally return to the terminal. The captain comes on again to say it will be 30 minutes for the mechanic to look at the problem (no heat to the cargo bay). Once again, the captain comes on to say that we need a new circuit board and we will be delayed again. By this time, they were telling people they could disembark, if they wanted to, and there would be drinks and snacks. Gradually, most passengers disembarked and they had to take ALL of their belongings with them. To make a long story short, our flight was to leave at 10:10 and we finally left at 1:10. Of course, we missed our connecting flight in Honolulu as we were going to Kauai."
Mar 2020,40,Good flights as strange as that is to say these days,Flights were on time (actually landed early) and the seats were comfortable. The attendants were very cordial and efficient.
Mar 2020,50,United to Narita,Great service to Japan. Worth the upgrade to economy plus. Extra room for long haul flight was perfect. Still a bargain fare. Service was good food terrible but I’ve yet to find any airline food that was enjoyable. Free beer and wine was a plus. The ice cream and sorbet was a nice change too from normal dessert offerings. Great entertainment selection to pass the time.
Mar 2020,20,Very uncomfortable flight,"Although the customer service was very good on board; the hard seats, tight rows and terrible food made for a very long and uncomfortable flight!! Also, the sound  quality for the in-flight entertainment was very poor!!"
Mar 2020,50,Smooth trip to bumpy slopes,"Great service from MEX to SLC. The flight crew was awesome and friendly. Flights were on time and smooth. The aircraft amenities all worked. And as much as I dislike the personal device entertainment (small screen and have to hold the device), the system worked very well.  Gate situation on all legs was orderly and efficient.  Happy Trip!"
Mar 2020,30,"United Flight fine, Houston Airport Passenger Processing Terrible","United flights were fine - on time, connecting gates close together, service on board. Transfer from 1st flight to 2nd flight was a real pain. After going through immigration and customs at Houston, we had to go through security again, even though we had never left secure area. In the process, there were no obvious directional signs for TSA Precheck (we don't believe there were any), so we were pushed through regular security check = long lines! Shoes, belts off, pockets emptied, etc. Then the TSA agent rather ""scolded"" us that we had failed to take out CPAP. IPad, etc, claiming that we should have gone thru the TSA Precheck downstairs. No such signage in our view. We were told to just go up the esculator., which ended in the long security lines. This whole process took up over 1 1/2 hours of a 2 1/2 hour connect time. Very poorly managed system! What good is investing in TSA Precheck when you can't use it?"
Mar 2020,40,Really good!!,"Virgin cancelled our flight from New York, could not be helped. Only one hour later coming in United Airlines was our airline. Never flown with them before, nice plane, leather fabric mix seats, excellent service from cabin crew."
Mar 2020,30,Nothing special,7 hour flight with no movie service unless you have your own device that has the united app installed. My 90 year old dad doesn't own a smart device so was without entertainment for the flight. i gave him my phone that had the app but small screen was not worth watching.
Mar 2020,50,Best flight ever,"After a great trip to Hawaii, there is only one way to get back to the States. And that is on United's Fleet that have the angled beds in first class. Take the evening flight so that you can sleep during the night. You have unlimited drinks, full dinner, free movies, blankets and pillows beds completely lie flat. For breakfast and hot warm towels in the morning when you wake up. It was the perfect ending to a perfect trip."
Mar 2020,50,Wonderful Round Trip - United - Newark to St. Lucia,It was a great trip. Smooth flight. Everything on time. Direct flight. Crew was excellent. Baggage handled well.
Mar 2020,50,Great Experience!,We actually flew from Calgary to Houston and then on to San Antonio and then returned San Antonio to Houston with United Airlines. All 3 were excellent experiences with wonderful attendants and service. Very comfortable flights and everything was on time. I would highly recommend United!
Mar 2020,50,Economy only had about 30 passengers,There was plenty of room to spread out. No one was coughing. Picking up our bags was a breeze. The airports were not busy.
Mar 2020,30,United International from Newark,"Service was OK but by the end of the flight, bathrooms were filthy. The crew did very little to keep them clean. Seats were small and uncomfortable, not very pleasant for 11 hours."
Mar 2020,40,Enjoyable flight,Very enjoyable flight home from the Grand Caymans with United Airlines.  Comfortable seats in Economy plus with plenty of leg room for my 5’11”.  Good in flight entertainment and pleasant service from the efficient crew.
Mar 2020,10,worst connection ever in 30 years,Our flight was cancelled on thursday night from Houston to Querétaro Mex.  We have waited a complete day( Friday) at the George Bush airport in Houston for a connection to Querétaro Mexico.  We had to change our plans flying from Houston to Dallas and the day after(Saturday) from Dallas to Querétaro .    United did not answer to our claims about their bad service.
Mar 2020,50,Wonderful experience!,This was my best experience with UA. The plane was fairly new and spacious. The flight attendants had great service on board. My carry-on luggage was checked in to my final destination without any fee. It was a great flight!
Mar 2020,50,"UA flight, but transferred to Air Canada Great Flight","Booked with UA but it was actually an Air Canada plane and staff. Flight was only 20% full so plenty of space to spread out. Excellent flight, left on time and arrived on time, lovely cabin crew could not have been better."
Mar 2020,30,Not the Best,"Very disappointed with this airline/ seats were very narrow / food was not very good, in fact could not eat the main meal.Cabin staff were not too friendly / seemed to be in a rush to get their tasks done. By choice I would not use this airline again."
Mar 2020,40,The People are their Greatest Asset,"Overall, the flight was great. I was in economy plus from Amsterdam (AMS) to Chicago (ORD), and upgraded to First class for the remainder of the trip to Philadelphia (PHL). Seats were comfortable, plenty of legroom, flight attendants did a great job. The crew made several rounds offering small bottles of water.    The prepared meal on the leg from AMS to ORD was okay - not getting a gourmet meal on an airplane. Wine and beer were complimentary on the route from AMS to PHL, and the selections of beer were good - I'm an IPA drinker."
Mar 2020,40,MCO to ORD Pleasant Flight Crew,"Great Flight Crew, flight left (MCO) on time arrived early (ORD). The Beverages (Basic Non-Alcoholic) were included (Normally $3.50 on other airlines). The Service from Telephone Awards Booking for this Flight was TERRIBLE (Spoke with an Agent??? from another country could not understand her spoken words and was Absolutely SSLLOOWW in booking the Flight). So slow I missed the previous Award Travel flight from MCO to IAD (Dulles) with my final destination of Knoxville TN (TYS), did Not arrive Knoxville until 8:15pm"
Mar 2020,40,Okay Flight,"Upon arrival at the airport, the agent at check-in, was very pleasant. The process went quickly. As a result of turbulence, there were no drinks on the flight. Despite the turbulence, the plane made good time. My seat was comfortable, but the leg room was limited.The cleanliness of the plane was only mediocre. The agent on board was very nice. Unfortunately, I lost my eye glasses at the gate when boarding. I was disappointed that United did not have a lost and found at the airport. I found the e-mail claim form to be confusing. I ended up having to call an agent for help with filing the claim. I was kept on hold for 45 minutes. Despite some of the issues that I had, I will continue to fly, I will continue to fly United, as it seems to be the only plane that has a direct route from Buffalo to Newark and back."
Mar 2020,30,Not bad but not great either,The flight was simple but expensive. Was probably better off paying round trip and forgetting the first flight. The only issue was the seats are extremely tight. Than god not that long of a flight. My experience is that Jet Blue has friendlier staff. Not terrible but for 1 way... expensive.
Mar 2020,40,Routine flight,Seats were very tight. I didn’t like the seats. They hurt my back- 3 choices for snacks though and nice flight attendants
Mar 2020,50,Military Family and Life Counselor,"United airlines staff at London Heathrow demonstrated genuine respect, quality customer service and professional aptitude. Please ... Thank you ... and How can I help were at the forefront of every conversation. Always welcoming with genuine smiles and welcoming respect eminated from every staff member from ticketing agents, security and on through flight attendants. Looking forward to booking my next trip to the UK on United Airlines."
Mar 2020,30,Quick trip to Florida to watch baseball's Spring Training,Good service provided by staff during our return trip home. Arrangements were made to accommodate two passengers with mobility issues.
Mar 2020,30,Weather delays,"We flew direct from Arcata to Denver and returned to see our son, his wife, and our new granddaughter. The flight to Denver was uneventful. The return flight was delayed 5 hours. The connecting flight takeoff from the Dakota's was delayed by a thunderstorm there, then a later flight opportunity was delayed by a thunder cell moving through Denver. Due to time change we did arrive in Arcata before midnight. The flight was smooth."
Mar 2020,30,Melbourne to Los Angeles,good service  not as good as flight from San Fran to Sydney  seat row full and tighter  staff ok  in flight movies --- good
Mar 2020,40,Hard time leaving Toronto,"Our flight boarded as planned, on time. When they went to push the plane away from the ramp it would not go. There had been a bit of snow and freezing overnight and the plane was frozen to the ground a bit and the pushing tractor had no traction to get the plane moving. We sat at the ramp for over three quarters of an hour before a larger tractor came to push the plane back. Then there was the deicing that had to take place and again another half hour waiting for that to happen and 15 to 20 minutes to deice the plane. I was getting nervous at this point because I had a connecting flight to catch in Houston and the window was closing quickly. We mad it to Houston just in time for me to run to the next gate and get to the plane just before the doors closed. I do not recall any apologies for the delays while in the plane or when we landed. I know the ground crew was the one responsible for the plane getting stuck at the ramp but United should have been keeping the passengers informed and at least be holding the connecting flights for this plane."
Mar 2020,40,Good service,great plane  good service  excellent legroom  paid for it  in flight movies were good  nice flight attendants
Mar 2020,50,On Time and no hassels,"Easy way to get to Colorado Springs without going on a ""economy"" airline no hidden fees just good ole on time and good service."
Mar 2020,10,Delayed by 6 hours,"The pilot backed into something when we were leaving the gate so that grounded that plane. It was originally a 3 hour delay. Then it turned into a 4 hour delay. So we boarded the next plane and sat for around 30 minutes, then had to get off that plane because of maintenance issues. So we waited another 2 hours before getting the actual plane that took us to Lubbock. This caused me to miss a meeting which I really needed to attend. I usually am satisfied with United but the past 2 trips I have taken I have been delayed and had to change planes. Not happy :("
Mar 2020,50,An Excellent Airline,"We generally fly United as Newark airport is the closest one to where we live. But it is not only for this reason, but for the fact that our experience with them has always been very good. They make every effort to be on time, and to see to our needs on every flight. We have flown on both foreign and domestic flights.  Four years ago we have made reservations to fly to Western Canada, but my wife became ill. We had to cancel our trip, and United gave us a complete refund."
Mar 2020,10,Worst airline united,The airline escalated the price 5 times after booking just because their customer service personnel couldnt confirm it on time. The flight was delayed and my 2 year old child was seated alone away from me.
Mar 2020,30,"Great flight, except for the crying kid on the woman's lap next to me","As usual, ground delay, then made up time in the air. Which is nice to have too spend less time in the air. 1hr 55min. I'll take it. However I had a woman next to me with a two year old child in her lap the entire flight. The kid was not happy about flying and cried for about 2 hours. (yes he cried during taxing and boarding too) Then about half way through the flight the kid crapped himself. I don't know what the kid ate, but I'm betting road kill would have smelled better. United should have a place for kids like that.(May I recommend the cargo hold?) Also, if I can't hold a small tablet or a 12 oz soda can in my hand during take off or landing. How is holding a 40lbs child safe?"
Mar 2020,40,Celebrating The Life Of An Old Friend,"Good floight, very attentative flight steward. Aircraft was a bit cramped but very tolerable. Flight Steward funny and knowlegable."
Mar 2020,40,Great as usual,Like usual the flight was delayed slightly on the ground. But we made up time in the air. My only complaint is the seats are too tight. I can not but help bumping into the person next to me. I'm just glad they are quick flights 2 and half hours.
Mar 2020,50,Yes to punctual Airlines,Simple punctuality goes a long way. Great flight attendant service offering to hang my suits on the front rack. Paying attention and courtesy towards isle passengers is second to none.
Mar 2020,40,nice evening on United,"Had a good flight back on United, the first section Miami to Chicago was supper the plane was slightly roomy and I was econ plus. The second leg was tighter in economy, but over all it was ok, nice free refreshments (coke, coffee, tomato juices). I working toward a million mile on United, sure hope i reach one day soon. It is hard on domestic flight. I am retired so my overseas flying day have pretty much ended. United a good carrier."
Mar 2020,10,An absolute trip from hell,"Let's see, besides changing my flights without any notification, destroying my luggage, being called a liar by some of their staff, and overall staff being extremely rude to boot, it's hard to find anything nice to say. Oh wait, there was one staff member at Dulles who was awesome. Too bad she doesn't work for a better company. I wrote a review after all this happened but never heard a word from anybody. General consensus? Never again on United. I will drive myself to another airport so I can get an option besides United. Note: this trip was taken Jan & Feb 2019, dates not available below."
Mar 2020,40,What a breeze flying on United,"A short time ago, United couldn't get things right. Worst example, their WIFI often was down. To their credit things have changed. I took this flight from Denver to Ft. Myers. Everything worked. The gate personel, the flight attenedents, the on-board service, and even the bathrooms were clean. Actually landed early."
Mar 2020,30,Just OK,"The flight down was unremarkable. We had a quick layover in Washington DC and just made it to the gate to make the connecting flight. The return flight was not a pleasant experience as there was no screen to watch the free movies and TV shows that we had on the way down. The flight from Aruba to Washington DC is the longest stretch and they did not have any snacks other than pretzels by the time they got to our seats in row 24. The shorter flight had the screens, but there was no time to watch a movie and no snacks were offered, just a drink."
Mar 2020,10,Worst Ever,"Will never again consider basic economy without seat selection. Last row in front of bathrooms was unfit for humans. I'm 5'9"", not by any means a large person but this was a very tight squeeze. They have the nerve to charge anyone for these seats. Flying is stressful enough but to add insult to injury with these seats...ugh!    Now about the flight, through no fault of the airline, we hit an abundance of turbulence, even upon descending for the landing. The roughest flight I'd ever experienced. I actually prayed we wouldn't fall out of the sky land safely. The awful seats didn't add any confidence or comfort either.    It really peeves me that they would charge so much for checking in a carry-on sized bag, considering it was once included in the air fare."
Mar 2020,40,Delhi International Airport NOT ready for international transfers,"The United flight from SFO to Delhi is 16+ hours, arriving at midnight, or thereabouts. Even in business class, this is long but doable. Following the signs upon disembarkation, I landed at an international transfer temporary holding area with plenty of plastic seats and a long desk manned by a half dozen bored millennials staring at their phones. I presented my boarding card for my transfer flight to Colombo, Sri Lanka. I was told to sit down and a new one would be issued in 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, back to the desk. No new boarding card. A phone call was made and I was told that ""she"" is coming right now with your new boarding card. Another 30 minute wait. No boarding card. Five minutes later, she appears. No explanation or apology for the 60+ minute wait. Going through the xray/security screening was slow, chaotic and nightmarish with the Indian requirements of what must be taken out of your bag. And there is only one machine working at this hour. And people are cutting in line. There is little attempt to keep things orderly. I will not use the Delhi airport ever again for an international transfer."
Mar 2020,50,Good flights!,"I downloaded the United Airlines app before I left and found it to be very helpful! I received up to date communications including reminders to check in on line, when the flight was delayed and when it was on time. I think the staff was wonderful! From check in to the in-flight staff. Pleasant and accommodating. I must admit I was worried before using this airline as the reviews are not always favorable but I had a wonderful experience and would try to choose United for my next flights."
Mar 2020,20,Filthy interior.,"The surfaces were filthy. The seats had food on them. The floor had grimy tracks and items like chips, pretzels, and french fries stuck to the legs of all three seats ahead of me. Gross. I flew from LAX to Texas of AA and it was MUCH cleaner. Beware of United. This plane was GROSS."
Mar 2020,40,Good flight from SNA to SFO and back during Coronavirus,"So a week before I flew up for a back/forth one day business trip from Irvine to San Francisco, when I booked the flight there were only aisle seats in the very back. The day before the flight which was March 4th (flight) when I got boarding passes, suddenly seats opened up. I wound up with an empty row over the wing going and one other person in the row coming back . This was because of all the people who were I guess too scared to fly. I found the flights safe, clean, easy, smooth and on time. Crews were excellent. My only quibble price over $500 but I guess relatively last minute. I'm over 60 but no health issues and no worries, I commend United's professionalism and care."
Mar 2020,50,Vacation,"United airlines has really improved a lot,  their service is excellent and their flight  attendants are very attentive to the needs  of the passengers. I would highly recommend  United Airlines."
Mar 2020,50,Do not fly United Express,Our flight to NY was dreadful - so crowded - seats were so tight that our knees were in the back of the people in front of us - this won't happen again. The trip back was crazy - the flight was delayed 4 times - gates change 3 times - absolutely unacceptable.
Mar 2020,30,Not the best,The flight was actually super quick. I will give them that. Staff is extremely rude and possibly the most in adequate stewards I have ever come across. Some how my sweater are got tripped up 8n the beverage cart. The steward almost broke my neck off and then proceeded to mean look me like it was my fault. I understand accidents happen however still not professional way to react.
Mar 2020,50,Excellent care on turbulent flight,This was a very turbulent flight and in spite of that our flight attendants and crew were wonderful.
Mar 2020,40,Flight to Israel,"The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful on this flight. They served several meals and snacks, although I tried to sleep as we were arriving in the afternoon in Tel Aviv. The only criticism I had was how little leg room I had so my legs were very sore and cramped after the flight."
Mar 2020,40,United,"I take this flight every time. I look forward to going to Haneda instead as its much closer to the city. The seats are much better now with Polaris and the service has improved since I started flying United in 2007. I recommend this flight, but prefer the odd inside seats (window even better, A or L)."
Mar 2020,10,Giant in middle seat spilled into my seat,"United allowed a giant to sit in a middle seat in Economy Plus in a full plane. He was so bug that his arms, legs, belly, shoulders all encroaches significantly into my seat. United needs to adopt a passenger if size policy similar to Southwest. They offered me $150 credit and 10,000 bonus miles, I will not fly United again."
Mar 2020,20,Lost my luggage with clothes for NYE,"One of the bags with my formal clothes for New Years Eve was lost in Denver. In Frankfurt and Budapest, I was told it was in Frankfurt. Needless to say, it did not arrive in time for the ball"
Mar 2020,10,Liars,"My flight landed late because of refueling. Washington-Dulles was very slow. I was 5 or ten minutes late to the gate. I missed my connecting flight like multiple others on my flight. They gave me a ticket for the morning and told me to go get a hotel they would reimburse me. After a week I received an answer. They said my flight delay didn't happen. To deny me is one thing, but they boldly lied right to me. Of course I had no recourse to argue. Thumbs down, I will never fly United again."
Mar 2020,30,Unusual situation on United Airlines,"Normally United Airlines does a very good job for me flying to wherever I care to go. This time was not that case. Flying our flight to 445 from Miami to San Francisco, the stewardesses we're almost invisible. The only way to get a refill on anything at all was to go to the galley and ask them for it."
Mar 2020,20,"Air travel is always awful, particularly United from Newark",No worse that most flights on United and from Newark Airport -- something merely to endure. The airport is really terribly crowded as are the flights.
Mar 2020,40,"Non Stop service from NYC to Capetown, South Africa","New great non-stop service from NYC to Capetown, South Africa. A 14 hour trip, but very compfortable seats, great food and service."
Mar 2020,40,Return from Disney,Very good flight. Left on time. Did a very nice job loading plane. One low point was that it took forever for our luggage to arrive on the carouselin Newark
Mar 2020,10,"Booked Nov 9th. Cancelled by United March 10, 2020","So looking forward to trip, but this AM United emailed me to tell me that United had cancelled my flights, offering me 2 options going and 2 options returning. Going options were 1 day later and now approx 39 hours instead of 12 hours. Return options were now 21 hrs rather than 9 1/2 hours and a day later. 2 days wasted of hotel stay and where was I going to stay for additional night?    Refund application made but who knows if it will be granted?    A couple of trips ago, due to airline issues, I arrived in Roatan a day late, and then I found out that United had cancelled my return trip. Don't ever try to phone long distance on a cell phone to United, because I ended up talking to someone who I could hardly understand likely in India who refused to believe my situation and then hung up on me."
Mar 2020,30,Good entertainment,"Newark airport is crazy expensive for bad food. 40$ for 2 coffee and 2 deserts ! Just insane. Food on the flight was bad, very salty. Service ok. American airlines are very pleasant if you are used to European and Asian service."
Mar 2020,40,On time,On time flight is really important between airlines.UA was really good on this flight.Staff were so nice and helpfull.
Mar 2020,40,Good Flight,The aircraft was clean and staff attentive to needs of passagers. The flight left on schedule and arrived ontime.
Mar 2020,40,Excellent on the way to Fort Lauderdale ok on the way back,It was worth the money unlocked on the way back last row middle seat the staff was good but could not hear tv because it was so loud
Mar 2020,50,Winter Break,The flight going to Arizona was great since we had a tv screen and were able to watch Direct TV.. so that made the trip very enjoyable and relaxing. The flight attendants were very nice and pleasant to chat with another plus! The flight back wasn’t as pleasant since I had back row seat in the middle and couldn’t move and no movies to watch to make my flight pleasant but the flight attendants were very nice so that was a was good.
Mar 2020,50,Polaris is good,"The bed in the Polaris cabin is very comfortable, getting spoiled, particularly for long flights.  Food and service very good"
Mar 2020,50,Flying home,"The flight was in time. A very long flight home and staff are always pleasant, offering water, or feeding patrons. I had an aisle seat so could come and go as I liked. I also took advantage of the airlines website to watch free movies which makes the flight seem shorter.  While they don’t have snacks to offer, there are always wrapped leftovers from lunch plates such as crackers and cheese to hold a hungry belly. We were at our next destination in no time. The flight arrived early."
Mar 2020,50,Vacation to Big Island Hawaii,On return flight the cs agents were a bit rigid and didn't want to discuss seat selections. They did give us ok seats but we moved to better after getting on.
Mar 2020,40,Very Professional,"Right on time from beginning to end. Nice leg room when you pay for the ""premium economy"" upgrade. A must for any flight over two hours. Service was good. Everything worked well. Had a wheelchair waiting as ordered. Baggage came quickly. Overall good experience."
Mar 2020,40,normal--same old stuff buy your own food-free soft drinks,Ok flight-- same old story people carry on too much and take up overhead space not even above their seats
Mar 2020,20,Red eye from Newark to Savannah is quite a trip.,"If you plan to take this flight, be prepared to take a shuttle to the farthest end of the airport with your carry-on. There is no place to eat there. If before boarding the shuttle."
Mar 2020,20,Don't book last minute with United,"This was a last minute trip, leaving in a day and staying for five nights. Thinking I would get a better airfare, I tried to book online with United. The flight in premium economy was $1,700 (2 seats). Since I had just seen fares for the same route for $348/ticket I checked on Orbitz. At Orbitz, I got basic economy and a car for $1,200. The only problem with Orbitz was that you couldn't upgrade to a better seat. United punished us for our 'sin' of trying to not pay an arm and a leg by sticking us in middle seats both ways, not allowing a carry-on back, and you don't get full mileage credit . I have have over 700,000 lifetime miles on United so I pretty disappointed in this treatment. I will be re-thinking booking on United again.    Additionally the flight attendant was really rude. I was trying to assist a hearing impaired person beside me who wanted two snacks, the attendant took the basket away before I had a chance to get her second choice. The flight attendant said, ""she already has one."" The guy next to me was nice enough to give her one of his."
Mar 2020,50,united were excellent overall.,Really good cabin staff. Good food. Kept offering items for your comfort without needing to be asked. Everything worked & was in good order. Clean. Great pilots. When I had a problem with flights which was not their fault anyway they went out of their way to solve it for me & waived any extra payment. Can’t speak too highly of the service I received which was over a few international & domestic flights.
Mar 2020,40,"good, solid experience","outbound flight was excellent, on time, was able to change seats since plane was only about 60% full. Seating is comfortable and entertainment selection is good. Return flight was delayed about 45 minutes and never told why, plane arrived to Dulles late. We were kept aware of delays with frequent texts. United does a great job sending reminder texts...almost too many. Flight attendants were profession though not terribly friendly."
Mar 2020,50,no problems,"well done no issues great free entertainment, probably could have offered more in the way of food, but all was OK"
Mar 2020,50,Great Customer service - Check in,"Our flight was cancelled. We about to be stranded in the airport the flight people at the gate were not helpful and rude and told up to more or less suck it up and sleep in the airport, mind you I am slightly handicap. We went back to the check in counter and the ladies there were very nice, helpful and caring and took great care of me and my son with a room and food. Thank you United."
Mar 2020,40,Las Vegas Trip,"Very good flight, check in and all-around good experience. With basic economy ticket had to have an agent approve my carry on bag."
Mar 2020,20,Money Pit $,Very disappointed that we needed to pay for our carry-on bags!!! Considering how much you pay for a ticket....then tack on another $100 for one check-on bag and two carry-on bags not included!! Need to check into Southwest next time (although they don't fly out of ABE )
Mar 2020,50,Flight to Belize City,"I had bad experience prevously on United, but my opinion changed after this flight. Great flight good crew and clean plane. I would not hesistate to fly with them again."
Mar 2020,40,excellent people working the gate ad on the plane.,"Have had some really bad experiences with United in the recent past. This week was much better. Hoping they learn that since we have little choice in choosing our airlines these days that when I do choose , the service and value do matter."
Mar 2020,50,Last minute flight,"I had a last minute funeral to attend and made reservations only with a couple of days to spare. As reserved, my flight was to be made to Minneapolis with a moderate layover in Denver. The return was awful...14-hour layover in Denver arriving home the day after I left. I checked in at the counter on the first leg of my journey and inquired from the representative on duty if she could help me get home sooner. She checked the schedules and got me on a flight with only a one hour layover in Denver. Much improved. Certainly the seating is a bit crowded nowadays, but all flights were on time although packed. I will not complain because it met with better than what I expected to happen."
Mar 2020,30,Connecting flight to SFO,We took this flight on a Sunday night. Pretty full flight. The boarding was orderly and and the ground crew was friendly and efficient. The flight crew was good too.
Mar 2020,10,Horrible,Thirty bucks to check in a carry-on? Horrible! Avoid this airline at all costs! Took an hour to get any luggage that was checked-in!
Mar 2020,50,On time in winter!,United is the only option flying out of Presque Isle but I have to say that they are on time (weather permitting) and they have my vote if I have the option of flying with other airlines. The staff is helpful and the bags arrive with the flight. I've had nothing but good service from United.
Mar 2020,50,Wonderful Flight,"Even for a 11 hour flight was prepared myself before hand. Choose a seat in back, one over from the middle section so won't get bumped by people going done the isle. wore compression socks with slip on shoes. Neck pillow with an eye mask helped with my sleeping. The flight crew was pleasant and the plane was clean which I took extra care by wiping down my own area again as well. On time flight."
Mar 2020,50,As expected in economy for a roundtrip,"I really like the ease of using Evansville Dress Regional Airport. I'm happy that United has this flight. It's simple for TSA check-in and the flight is a quick way to get to other airports.    Yes, water and soda are available and a cookie or bag of pretzels are complimentary. Nothing fancy and you check your carry on at the end of the ramp as overhead storage is not available. On the return trip from MCI through ORD, I was given the option to check my carry on (for no fee) and I didn't have to lug it around ORD during my layover. I LIKE THAT OPTION!!!    I will consider this economical way to fly, again."
Mar 2020,50,Nice Flight,Nice flight. Very smooth and on time. Meal served was good. Service was very good. Plenty of room and clean. Check-in and boarding was easy.
Mar 2020,50,We have been very happy with United,"This recent flight from Ft Lauderdale to EWR was short but the service was great, as it usually is on United. We have not had a problem in years. I can't comment on in flight entertainment. I travel with downloaded books and movies on my tablet."
Mar 2020,40,Nice Amount of Room in Premium Economy Section,"We upgraded to Economy Plus seats. Shortly before our flight United changed our seats because they switched the aircraft to one with a different seating arrangement. We ended up in one of the new Premium Economy sections (without an upgrade or cost increase). Premium Economy has more leg room and width than Economy Plus, and the seats themselves are more comfortable. (We flew back in Economy Plus and missed the comfort of Premium Economy.)  The flights themselves were fine, and the crew on both flights were excellent. They have to have the patience of a Saint to deal with the people who are trying to jamb large bags into the overhead bins and who do not follow the crews' boarding instructions.  I'd give United 5 stars for the flights, even the food was quite acceptable, but my rating is apparently supposed to be for the airline, not the flight, so I knocked it down a star to reflect how incredibly hard is has been to check on the status of a refund for an upgrade we did not receive. Forget about calling United. We understand that they are probably dealing with zillions of panicked people calling about the virus, but even the website is hard to use and buggy. (Venting: The other problem United has is one they share with the other main-line carriers. We were willing to pay to upgrade to Business Class, but our tickets were not eligible for a paid upgrade at any cost. However, we were able to request a Mileage Plus upgrade. Now, I'm no financial genius, but wouldn't it make more sense for the airline to take our money for the upgrade then to fool around with the miles stuff?)  Bottom line: United is a safe way to fly and has some really great people. For long flights like this one, we will always try to fly in Business or the new Premium Economy section. I'm too big for Economy seats!"
Mar 2020,50,Trip to Denver,The trip was great! All flights left and arrived on time! Time of wait between connecting flights was reasonable. Airplanes were clean. Employees were friendly and helpful.
Mar 2020,40,organized boarding and very clean in the cabin,"Boarded on time, very organized which is nice as compared to a ""cattle call"" on some airlines. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful in getting everyone seated in a timely manner. Our flight left on time and arrived early. Everything was clean, we wiped down everything with a sanitizing cloth(because of the Coronavirus) anyway. We pay more on United but feel it is worth it as a gold premier member."
Mar 2020,20,Safe arrival,"Other than a safe arrival, which of course is paramount, I can’t think of anything positive to report."
Mar 2020,10,The usual minimal service,"From the service in Newark, when we left to our return, united’s customer service is nonexistent. Nice to be a monopoly!"
Mar 2020,30,Is loyalty to an airline worth it?,"Is loyalty to an airline worth it?  We have been loyal to United Air since 1990’s & used MileagePlus credit cards. United is a so so airline, MSN has limited carriers, thus unless we opt for O’Hare, options are limited.  We often have layover at O’Hare or Denver, wasting almost a day in transition. Within the last several years most comforts have been removed or for purchase. Legroom is nonexistent, my 6’4” husband is squeezed in on most flights.    We are offered 2 complimentary Club Passes annually yet haven’t been able to use any for years. Clubs exist only in big hubs & often are NOT open or available during certain hours or due to renovations.    Both our December 2019 trip ps West had layovers in Denver. Its North & South Clubs denied us access while obviously opened to higher tiered members!    United launched new policy effective January 2020, clearly demonstrates it prefers “higher paying customers over commoners”. This added insult to injury and made us feel treated as second class customers.    As retirees, we travel leisurely, don’t see any point in paying thousands to access Clubs with questionable services.  With NO regrets, we have flown other airlines & stopped using our MileagePlus Class ever since."
Mar 2020,30,challenging,"First of all I paid $50. more for my round trip ticket than the other 3 with whom I was traveling thinking that it included allowance for checking one bag-Wrong. I had to pay an additional $30. each way. Second, coming from a cruise ship we arrived 4 hrs before flight time & we were not allowed to check in or our baggage no sooner than 2 hrs. We had to stand and sit on the floor of the airport where travelers were entering from the outside. Not to mention that the seats are so cramped that the airlines should be ashamed & there couldn't be a better industry to hurt for business."
Mar 2020,30,...a little disappointed in crew,"The flight was on time. The flight was good. BUT, my daughter became ill (she's a medical professional) and told me she had to have some protein....I asked a stewardess if they had anything on board with protein on it I could give her. The answer was ""No""...that's it. Then we were served yogurt at a meal which is good protein."
Mar 2020,50,"Annual trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mx","Everything was great. We were in business class going to PVR on December 28, 2019.  Came home in economy plus on January 25, 2020."
Mar 2020,50,Great Flight from Snow to Beach!,This is a non stop flight! In 4 hours you leave the snow and land at the beach. As long as you get airborne you are going to arrive at your destination which beats the usual layover in Dallas or Houston.
Mar 2020,30,No wheelchair and a very long wait until the whole plane unloaded,"Although my son had ordered a wheelchair to meet us on arrival, none was there for me. There was one for someone else, so they motioned for me to take it. The attendant said we would have to wait to find out if the other person came to claim it. We were eager to get a cab and go home wince it had been a long day and we were very tired. We kept being told we needed to continue to wait rather than their ordering a wheelchair for me. After the whole plane was emptied she finally took us through customs, etc. This was a mistake on the part of the airline that they really did nothing to correct, and a very long and needless wait on our part."
Mar 2020,40,Surprisingly good,"To be honest I've expected worst flight experience, but it was pretty nice flight with Embraer 175 plane. The seat was very comfortable and wide. The crew was very friendly. There was a 15 minutes delay before boarding, but it is not an issue."
Mar 2020,30,People were nice!,"The people were nice, the service was nice. My flight attendant in the return flight remembered me after 18 days.    The clubs were nice.    Now for the BIG problems. No one told us that the airlines did not open until 6 pm. The cruise ship dropped us off in Buenos Aires at noon, and we got to stand around with all of our luggage until 6 pm. Had we known that, we could have made other arrangements. Oh, we could have sat on the floor since there were not seats.    Then on our next flight we had to fly in the back of a little tiny plane without even snacks from Houston to Nashville. We paid a LOT extra to be business class!!    Finally on each leg of the return trip, they damaged a different part of my scooter. They are promising to fix it, being diligent about it, but it has now been 3 weeks and it still hasn’t been fixed. It has flown American, British Air, and Southwest without a scratch in the past."
Mar 2020,50,Business Class to Zurich,"It was wonderful. the seats were comfortable in all positions, the movies offered were great (watched 5 going over), the food was excellent. Had their famous braised beef ribs (yum) and the ice cream sundae they made first in front of me. Service was exceptional, and I would fly United again."
Mar 2020,40,Visiting family,"I usually use this airline, because I always have good experience with this airline, their customer service is excellent, they work with you, the planes are clean and the best is that their fares are reasonable."
Mar 2020,30,normal,"flight and plane were normal and fine as well as the staff. Could of used more leg room, but wasn't willing to pay for 1st class, so you get what you get"
Mar 2020,40,Direct flight from Akron-Canton to Newark! But then what...,"It's great to have direct flights from our local regional airport -- short drive, easy parking, few crowds. But the flight goes to Newark, and it's a bit of challenge to get to New York City.    The inexpensive way: buy a ticket from a kiosk at the airport, take a train from the airport to a larger terminal, then a NJ Transit train to Penn Station. And then, a subway or taxi to the destination. We missed our first train from the airport and waited just a short time for another, but because of that we had to wait quite a while for the next NJ Transit train, then a loooong time for a taxi. And it was one of the few really cold, windy days this winter.    Next time, we'll drive a little farther to Cleveland and take the direct flight on Delta to LaGuardia and then a taxi to the city! A bit more expensive but MUCH quicker, and much less hassle!    The flight itself was fine, on little Embraer 145 planes, and United offers several flights a day to Newark."
Mar 2020,50,Newark to San Francisco RT is a Great Flight,"I've taken this long cross-country trip at least a half dozen times in the past year. Never a problem - check-in in both locations and access to the concourses always goes smoothly. (I am a 1K and also have TSA). Food is acceptable but that doesn't really matter as no one takes a particular airline for the food. Cabin crew is almost always professional, courteous, and aware. You do run into a few jerks in 1st (chair pushing, wanting to change seats so two people can sit together) but I think that is just a circumstance you and every airline has to deal with. I don't blame the flight crew for not intervening. Failure to book a flight together for two is not the airline's fault - it's the passengers' fault.    I do suggest that passenger etiquette is something that could be emphasized more in the pre-flight video.    Overall, I give United strong positive ratings."
Mar 2020,50,Buisnes First,"What an experience, the service, food, and amenities. Made the 15 hour flight a piece of cake. Would Ride United again in a heartbeat!"
Mar 2020,30,upgrade and take food,Unless you upgrade even if you are a thin short person your knees will be hitting the seat ahead of you which gets uncomfortable on a 14 hour flight. Take food with you that served on the airline is terrible..
Mar 2020,20,Cattle call,First class is getting smaller and the service is getting worse. On one flight we were sitting facing the tail of the plane in first class.    You have to ask and then ask again to get any beverages or service. I now have learned that United does not change. Still poor service.
Mar 2020,30,United flight to Las Vegas,Wish you had more room in Basic Economy. Flight was full so the seating wasn't comfortable and it was difficult to utilize the bathrooms. Flight attendants were efficient and distributed food and drink plus collected trash consistently. Flight home from Vegas was delayed 2 hours which made several people miss their connections in Houston. Still better than American Airlines from my experience.
Mar 2020,50,Made an exhausting business trip stress free,"Flew United to New Orleans for an exhausting business trip judging a dance competition. These are always exhausting but flying United made the travel part of the trip stress free. On time, easy process for checking in (using the ap) and the flight crew were super friendly and competent. Really helped make the traveling relaxing."
Mar 2020,50,Rebooking Grace,"Due to a family emergency we needed to return early, and since our tickets were bought with points it was a bit trick getting them changed.In the end the United rep made the changes, including similar seating, with no charge, on very short notice!"
Mar 2020,40,Great flight experience a starting with check-in,"Friendly service, helpful staff from check in to on board service. I need travel assistance, plenty of wheelchairs available at both airports."
Mar 2020,40,Surprise,"I was surprised that we took off on time, arrived on time, and was a decent flight. I had a bad experience with United Airlines on a trip from Edmonton to San Diego got delayed both ways. In San Diego we got delayed by United Airlines because they didn’t have enough people to fill the first plane. However I did catch a cold n this flight."
Mar 2020,30,Bad infection control practice by United personnel,"For the most part, this United flight was like most of their's - vanilla basic service with no flair. They get you there safely. However, as we boarded this flight, after all the other check-in procedures, United personnel inspected all carryon bags by passengers. They touched internal contents of purses, backpacks, small suitcases, etc., then proceeded to touch the same of the next passenger, etc etc etc. Without ever changing gloves. When questioned about changing gloves to reduce risk of transmitting Covid-19 or other pathogens, I was met with indifference and ignorance."
Mar 2020,10,Bad experience,"Seats are MUCH too narrow.    I did not know until after having paid for the ticket that I would not be allowed to have a carry-on.    Flight time was changed to about an hour earler that morning. I had been specific in saying that for any changes, I had to be notified by text, as I would not have access to my email. I received no text about the change in time, and missed the flight as a result. I did receive an email, but it was time-stamped later that afternoon, so I could not have made the flight anyway.    The only positive aspect of the trip was the courtesy and helpfulness of the staff."
Mar 2020,20,Find another airline,"With weather in January causing delays and cancellations, all airlines were having difficulties. But United's ticket counter response to help stranded passengers was atrocious. Everyone was left without any information at all. If it wasn't bad enough, several fellow passengers and I had our baggage delayed four days without any info from United about when they might be delivered. Finally, a claim I put in for reimbursement for toiletries and clothing has not even been selected for review for over a month and a half. Bottom line - do not fly United."
Mar 2020,50,"Great flight, great crew","Flew today from CLT-IAH on UA 6192. On time departure and arrived early in Houston. Sat in economy. On an ERJ 175, there’s no noticeable difference in legroom between premium economy and economy. However, premium economy costs $20 more. Not worth it on a 2 hr flight. It’s prob worth it if you’re over 6’ tho,    Great flight, great crew. Captain kept us updated throughout the flight, esp during turbulence. It’s nice to hear a reassuring voice when you’re a nervous flyer and the plane is rocking and bumping. There were multiple snack choices. Flight attendants were visible and friendly. Overall, great flight."
Mar 2020,50,It was quite,"The flight was quite and because it was a night flight, it was short. The worst think was the AirPort in Washington, which is not so nice."
Mar 2020,50,Very good red eye,"First time on this non-stop flight. It was a very good flight, leaving nearly 9pm from Maui. Very convenient since it allowed us to spend the day enjoying the island and have a great dinner before going to the Airport. Be sure to eat before going to the airport since by this time most services are closed. There was a quick service soon after take-off, then lights off and mostly quiet allowing folks to sleep. The pilot announcements were limited dealing with bumpy period during the flight. Arrived at Denver early and luggage was delivered reasonably rapidly."
Mar 2020,50,Always well taken care of.,"We arrived from Chicago to Honolulu ahead of schedule. The attendants were so friendly and attentive. There was a slight mix up with my food service which was not, in my opinion, a big deal. They went out of their way to compensate me."
Mar 2020,50,United express experience,Flew United express which is cheaper. We reserved our seats for a charge and were not allowed a Carry on. It was awesome. Not having a bag to roll around everywhere was liberating. The plane was small; only 3 seats across - and you could see out both sides. Was nice as boarding and deplaning were a snap. The plane was half empty so I had had two seats for spreading out.
Mar 2020,50,Typical Excellent United Service,"I have flown United several times and have always found them to be punctual and professional.  This trip was an overnighter from Buenos Aires to Indianapolis with a layover in Houston. I always book well in advance in order to get seats that fit my 6’4” frame, but I learned when at check in that they had switched aircraft and our seating assignment. I was particularly concerned that we were in the center of a 3-4-3 configuration. However, the agent checking us in assured us that we would like these seats better than the ones we had originally chosen, and he was right. We were on their newest plane and in the middle bulkhead. Being by a window was irrelevant since we were flying at night. Our seats were wider and we had more than enough leg room. We were served dinner almost right away (nearly 11:00 PM) and were able to sleep off and on. Breakfast, such as it was, was served about 90 minutes before we arrived in Houston. Flight time was about 10 hours.    We have had Global Entry passes ever since they were offered 6 or 7 years ago, and they have saved us so much time. However, when you enter a country you still have to claim your luggage, go through customs, and return the luggage for the last leg. Sometimes this can be very confusing with lots of walking, etc. This time, we literally picked up our luggage, never broke stride as we walked by a police dog, and then returned it to the belt to be reloaded onto the next plane. The airport in Houston is beautiful, clean, and accessible, but the personnel with which we came in contact was just plain surly.  We had about a 3-hour layover, but by the time we jumped through all necessary hoops, we only had an hour and a half or so.    We arrived in Indy a few minutes ahead of time, about 12:35 PM. We picked up our luggage, caught the shuttle, and were back in our car on the way home in about 50 minutes. Indianapolis has to be the best airport in the U.S."
Mar 2020,40,Easy Does It,Everything about our flight went very smoothly from booking to landing. The best feature of any of the flights we have taken with United is the in-flight staff. All of the flight attendants were both friendly and helpful without being intrusive. The only slight criticism is with the on-board entertainment. Even though there were lots of movies the selection was poor and the tv shows that were offered were limited. Our flight took off on time and landed early. Will definitely fly United again.
Mar 2020,20,I miss Continental,"The First Class seats were larger than coach, but too firm and was stressful to my injured back muscles. I fly First because of this injury so its not aggravated. United food is typically just OK, and often what I would not tolerate at a Diner. As usual the on board WiFi was not working. No TV provided so I tried to sleep for the short flight. To my surprise the flight was on time, though it did take 15 minutes for the jet way to deploy so we could deplane. I regret to say I fly often, and this over all experience is not unusual."
Mar 2020,40,My usual flight from EWR to TXL (Berlin),"As always, a very good flight with no issues in both terminals and great service on the plane. Check In, security control,access to the First Class lounge and priority boarding. In Flight accommodations were good and luggage claim and security at the Berlin airport were quick."
Mar 2020,40,This airline is well organized and sends helpful emails,"If you sign up for it, United will text &/or email you updates and reminders of your flight. This function was very helpful especially for people who do not fly very often."
Mar 2020,30,Comedy of errors,"Leaving Charleston to Dulles for transfer to NY, no problem, even with late departure, but picked up some time. BUT...when arriving at Dulles I only had 20 minutes to transfer from outer terminal via bus. Made it to gate with 2 minutes to spare, only to find flight was delayed. Now, incoming message said flight was delayed. Another posting, flight delayed further. Another message again, posted another time, due to waiting for a plane to arrive. Plane arrived but had mechanical problems and now had to wait for maintenance crew to repair. NOW close to 4 hour delay, I felt the airline should have given out food vouchers, even though they put out chips and bottled water for the waiting passengers. The counter people referring to posted sign when asked about delay. When all said and done, flight was comfortable and calm with all the delay involved. United needs to give counter people more leadway to authorize food vouchers or other services when they see delays backing up more than posted"
Mar 2020,30,No leg and seat room - I am 5’5”,"Horribly cramped seating, couldn’t fit dinner tray and beverage together. Food was below average. Breakfast bagel - no cream cheese, butter or any topping! Dry!    Flight did not have bottled water or offer it rarely. One time in 12 hour 20 minute flight!    I tried their website for comments and every time I hit submit- doesn’t work. Customer service line puts you in circles then 20 minute wait."
Mar 2020,40,"Good flight, but airport experience was lacking","Monitors in the lounge said the flight was ready for boarding, but when I got to the gate everyone was standing around waiting. It took at least another 20 minutes before boarding started."
Mar 2020,40,"United airlines flight March 02 ,2020","I change my flight when I arrive early at Las Vegas airport and noted there was another United flight departing about 50 mins to Denver, I looked up at my cell and show economy plus seats available. I was able to booked a seat for the earlier flight. Prior to boarding I was upgraded to Business class to my surprise. I am a gold member and really appreciated the upgrade. The service was great and flight attendants are all very nice and courteous. Flight was on time and able to get back to my office earlier."
Mar 2020,20,regular,"I bought two tickets in a single order for me and my wife. The company put us in separate seats, in different rows. I asked to put us together but I should need to pay more than US$ 100! Disgusting..."
Mar 2020,30,Visiting family,"My grandson and I went to the UK to visit my family. We flew United. The flight was uneventful however the food sucked. I am a diabetic and there was not for me to eat. The food that I brought with me was taken by TSA and no time to get more at the gate. I asked the attendant if there was a diabetic meal. No they had vegetarian, vegan, kosher, Muslim. I could not buy anything either because it was an international flight. I will still use United, but only on domestic flights"
Mar 2020,50,Nice flight and friendly crew but very slow baggage recovery in Detroit,The ground attendants and in-air flight attendants were friendly; the plane was clean and my wife and I were given seats next to each other even though we had basic economy tickets. The flight took off 10 mins late only because the gate agent was answering questions instead of watching the clock to begin boarding on time. We landed 10 mins late but had to wait almost 40 mins for our bags after stepping off the plane - the longest I have ever waited and no explanation.
Mar 2020,40,If you have a 13 hour flight try to buy the first class ticket,"United Airlines is great except, there is no room in Premium Economy. I ruined my back trying to sit cramped up for 13 hours. If you have a long flight save up for the First Class Ticket. If not you may be paying a physician to look at your back pain.  The flight attendants, entertainment console, snacks were all excellent. I will never torture myself again, trying to sit in those seats. I will more likely just stay home if these seats are going to be standard for now on."
Mar 2020,50,Great Flight,"Although this is a long flight, the 787 is a great plane to fly in. We like the large windows, the adequate seat space and the air ventilation. Also there was a huge selection of movies to watch. We didn’t feel all that tired at the end. The only thing that would have made it better was if the attendance were a little friendlier."
Mar 2020,30,Great flight from Newark,"We departed in the evening with no delay which is a miracle because I notice many United flights taking off and coming back with delay. We were fortunate enough to get a tail wind that shaved about 1/2 hour off the flight. Newark Airport was great but the problem is with Barcelona, they share with another airlines causing huge backup at check in. I was the first one to check in but when they open the line it wasn't at the area, they moved it causing me to be the last in line. You have to be familiar with the location of check in. Check in was moved to the center instead of the side causing a massive rush to another location. Plus United employees in Barcelona were terrible and I give them a 1 out of 10. Barcelona needs work, they let lines pile up even at the gate. United was posted no where in the terminal you had to ask. At this time it was all the way on the left side of the terminal. Airport very poorly run especially finding your hotel shuttle but they have improoved with this. How hard is it to post a sign at every gate where the hotel shuttle his. Plus they lie to you about tax return on puchases. Don't waist your time, few years ago I got in line to receive tax status, it took over one hour, as of this day haven't received a thing, they are liars, plus it causes a delay trying to get on your plane. Cabin attendees were not the best and at times were lazy."
Mar 2020,40,"Newer plane, more leg room!","I gave it an above average review because the newer plane that we flew on had more leg room! Other than that, it was average."
Mar 2020,50,Panama City,"Wonderful direct flt to Panama City. Excellent service, flight crew was pleasant, professional, and very helpful. Panama CIty was amazing - it is a huge beautiful city!"
Mar 2020,20,Quality?,"Unfortunately flying has become a major chore. The airlines have really reduced the quality of the product to a minimum, an ever decreasing circle of reducing product value to accommodate cheaper prices. Value of the product should supercede the price. An international flight from Panama to Houston to connect to London is deemed to be an internal US flight, no inclusive food service, all about profit for the airline, poor legroom and poor seat confort, but then Houston to London the seat pitch was bigger, but the seats are wafer thin and the food served was simply awful. I was told it was a choice of Pasta or chicken. I particularly do not like pasta... the chicken slop was served with pasta.. Cheap and profitable to United, unappealing to passengers. It said a great deal when I considered the 'small bread offering', it had a use by date of November 2020, 9 months in the future. The company could not be bothered to even serve fresh bread. I feel that value in flying has been lost in general in the long haul airline industry allowing price and profit to overcome all things. Basic service on flights up to 4 hours is OK, but after that a value (comfort) product is so much more important."
Mar 2020,30,Mexico flight,Chairs don't recline as far as other airlines  You need to use your phone to download their app to watch a movie  Charges for check in baggage
Mar 2020,40,Worth to upgrade,"I booked through Flight Hub, which was a big mistake, they played their middle man part poorly because the 1st class tickets they issued me were for mix Air Canada and United flights from Calgary to Tampa, Air Canada used their yucky low cost airplanes which don't have first class seats, both Air Canada and Flight Hub pointed fingers at each other, I lost out.  I ended up paying United less than CND$200 to 1st class upgrade, worth every pennies!"
Mar 2020,50,Very attentive crew,"Took this flight to go for my first time to Mexico to celebrate my 60th birthday. The crew were very pleasant friendly people but the reason for the review is because about 15/20 minutes before landing the plane hit some very severe turbulence, so much so that one of the female flight attendants dropped to the floor and told me to put my hands on her shoulders to steady her. I am a very nervous flier to begin with and she saw that I was freaking out with the turbulence which is correct. However, she stayed with me calming me and really helping me get through it. She really helped me overcome the fear that I was experiencing. Finally, when she was able to get up she brought me m and m's and a cup to count the m and m's into to take my mind off of the now less severe turbulence. Just before we landed, she then  brought me a birthday card from the crew and a packet of gummy bears. I believe her name was Maria. She was flying back to Chicago that night. Those very kind touches that she gave me on that flight were so very much appreciated by this nervous flier. Thank you ."
Mar 2020,30,Short early morning Flight - no worries or concerns.,Booking and Check in online was quick and easy.  You tag your own baggage by yourself and then you drop it off at the counter.  Flight was on time.  Service was satisfactory. Light snack and drink offers  Plane was clean.  Seats average - like most airline seats.
Mar 2020,40,Nice Flight,"This was a nice flight - quiet with no issues or problems. The flight arrived early to my destination and on the return flight as well. I wish they would do something about the bag fees but ... overall, it was a good experience."
Mar 2020,50,Good experience with United,We had a very good flight with United-All the staff was very professional-helpfull-Our flight arrived on time-We got a very good price-A wheelchair was waiting for me when we dis-embarked in Tampa and when we arrived at EWR it was provided within minutes-The staff was very courteous and was very much appreciated
Mar 2020,50,Safety first,Our plane had mechanical problems after we boarded but were still at the gate. United kept us informed with in cabin announcements and texts to my phone. Unfortunately they were unable to fix the problem so we had to change planes. We were moved just two gates away and boarded another aircraft. While the total delay on the ground was almost two hours we arrived just over an hour late as the crew made up some of the time. Sometimes problems occur and how a company handles them speaks volumes. United did what was needed to get us to our destination safely.
Mar 2020,30,Flight to Dulles to see Family and Travel,"I accidently purchased Basic Economy and it was extremely cramped. I am 145 lbs and the gentleman next to me was tall and slim and we were still touching shoulders. The cramped seating for that class should be outlawed. Because we were so cramped, I began to experience restless legs due to not being able to have enough room to move my legs at all. It is absolutely ridicious! I could not comfortable use the controls on my arm rest because the guy next to me was so close. It was a miserable flight!"
Mar 2020,30,Red-eye ending to a Maui vacation,"The plan--and the reality--of escaping the Midwest in February were great; the flights not so much. Outgoing, a weather delay at O'Hare forced an overnight in Schaumberg, and we could find no return flights that weren't red-eyes--leaving Maui about 5PM and arriving in Chicago about 5AM. Especially on a two-aisle widebody, overnight in coach is never fun. Flight attendants did what they could, and we got a thin blanket, but the eats were spartan, the seats narrow, the legroom short, and the bathrooms crowded. Even with an Ambien, the night was painful and long. My best advice is to save up and splurge on first class--or business class if you can find it."
Mar 2020,50,Birthday Flight,"Super good connection to Chicago from Fort Wayne, Indiana. The flight was fast and easy in a nice, clean comfortable smaller plane. Short lay over and on to San Juan. Great flight, smooth and comfortable. Coming back we had excellent customer service with our bags and everybody was helpful. I will fly with United Airline again."
Mar 2020,50,Nice flight,"Nice smooth flights, clean planes, left and arrived early with adequate time to get to the next gate. Was very pleased!"
Mar 2020,30,"We got there and back, but...","I'm not a seasoned traveller. I've been in about 6 round trips dating back to the 1970s. Now, if you want to sit with your spouse, you pay extra. There is no overhead storage unless you pay extra. And, legroom, or seat room for that matter, is non-existent. Heaven forbid you should have to get up. Hate flying. I gave it an average rating only because we got there and back."
Mar 2020,40,"Seats were changed because sceduled plane size was change, however no issues with check in or seats assigned",Flight was comfortable with no issues. Staff at boarding and attendant staff were all very friendly.
Mar 2020,30,The same Airline?,"We usually enjoy flying United, but this flight was not enjoyable. The service was not up to United standards. The flight attendant was not considerate of the passengers trying to catch some sleep on the early flight - carrying on talking loudly the entire flight. She neglected asking if anyone would like a blanket and did not offer anything other than the in flight breakfast. The breakfast was an egg white sandwich - it was terrible and ridiculously sloppy. That item should never be served on a flight. It was not a positive experience.  BUT - on Saturday, March 7th we flew United (UA661) from LAX back to our final destination Chicago. That flight was absolutely amazing. The service was over the top. It is why I choose United over other airlines. A true first class experience!"
Mar 2020,30,Code share choice,Lufthansa codeshares with United on this Non-stop flight. Check your preferred flight times and choose Lufthansa operated rather United operated planes. Lufthansa offers a much better customer service experience. Also in FRA LH staff were extremely knowledgeable and helpful in arranging an alternate flight
Mar 2020,10,they just suck. took my seat without even a hand shake,now i know why domestic carriers get such a bad name. you hear of totally heavy handed and dishonest behavior by the carrier. but this is my first experience. wow. pretty sorry. they just suck. took my seat without even a hand shake
Mar 2020,10,Unreliable service,"I Purchased round-trip United airline tickets from Muskegon Michigan to Cancun Mexico. Both return flights ended up being canceled and rerouted to return to grand Rapids Michigan without any reason given. I was not given the option unless I wanted to pay full price to leave out of Grand Rapids, MI in order to have our car there upon returning. This cancellation by United was after ticket was paid for in full but 4+ months prior to departure. This makes our flight inconvenient because of no car, an increase cost to have other transportation to and from the airport to our home. The night before an early morning flight to Cancun, a text was received that outbound United flight was cancelled and a mad scramble was made to arrange alternate flight and transport to airport. This cancellation was due to the plane did not pass inspection! Why is this being done less than 12 hours prior to the flight?? Why can’t United bring in another plane? Obviously both United airlines AND Muskegon airport are unreliable if you want a carefree, on time or customer service experience! I will not plan again to fly from a small airport even though it is convenient nor will I use United airlines as a first choice as I have had other issues with them that are not addressed, poor customer service. This is sad as I did try to support my local business, however my time/money/vacation are important too! As far as United airlines, well I may need to use them at some point BUT, like they treated me, THEY will be a last thought!"
Mar 2020,40,Germany Christmas Markets,"Check in was easy, no problems. Flight was great, very good attendants.  Baggage claim in Germany was slow.  Paid extra for legroom. Saw no difference with other seats."
Mar 2020,40,"Newark to Punta Cana, easy as pie","Surprisingly fast to get into Newark, check in and through security. Same when arriving in the DR, we got through customs and got our bags quickly. The flight was smooth and left and arrived on time."
Mar 2020,30,Repairs delay flight. Entire flight misses overseas connections.,"After fully boarding there were mechanical problems, one after another until we had to deplane and get a new plane and crew. Total delay, 10 hours."
Mar 2020,40,"Ok flight, no headphones on board",Flight was good but there were no headphones and I use bluetooth ones which wouldn't connect to the TV's in the seatbacks. Flight attendants were friendly on the way there but not on the flight home.
Mar 2020,30,Very Disappointing,"Boarding was a fiasco. It was delayed for unexplained reasons and went slowly despite a fairly uncrowded flight. We boarded, sat, waited for 45 minutes, and then were told to disembark the aircraft due to potential weather-related problems on the route. The last of the people off the plane had not yet sat down in the waiting area when we were told to re-board the aircraft! Of course we had to queue up and scan our tickets again, and re-pack all the overhead bins again. Interesting thing happened in this timeline: suddenly this flight was absolutely booked to capacity and they forced many to check carry-ons at the door because there was no room in the overhead bins. This experience certainly had the appearance of United making a bogus excuse for a delay and sacrificing every imaginable customer service in order to simply fill a plane and maximize profits.    Second complaint--the plane itself was an older model with badly worn seats that sunk in and forced your back into the most unnatural and uncomfortable position imaginable, with headrests that jutted so far forward as to disallow your head from being upright. Several people complained about this during the flight.    Finally, the entertainment offered was the most limited I've ever experienced on an international flight. They offered the Star Wars series of movies and that's it. No TV, documentaries, or even music channels--just Star Wars.    We'll shop flights far more carefully in the future, and would hope that United would take note of the many areas in which they need to improve."
Mar 2020,30,We got there and back in one piece,The only thing I give them credit for is that we’re alive - but the rest was the worst. I couldn’t believe the food - I believe dog food would have tasted better. Since I couldn’t eat the food and I was so hungry I went to the back to see if they had any snacks and I got scolded by the steward for not bringing my own food.
Mar 2020,40,United's Basic Economy Works for Us!,"My husband and I have now flown Basic Economy twice this winter and it has worked well for us. We travel for 5-8 days total and can pack and check one suitcase for both of us and we each take a backpack that fits under the seat in front of us. We are NOT allowed to take a regular carry on suitcase that would go in the overhead bins. We even bring a few items for our son in the suitcase! Basic Economy also means you are in the last boarding group BUT it doesn't matter as you are not trying to fit anything in the overhead bins anyways. We get the same service on board as everyone else except First Class. You can't choose your seats; they are assigned after all seats are accounted for BUT if it's not a full flight, you can move to another seat. So, you may not be able to sit next to your partner/family with Basic Economy. United passed out blankets to all passengers on this flight which was nice. Our flight from Chicago to Spokane was on an Airbus but it did not have screens on board; they instead offered the ability to stream TV or movies on your own device during the flight. I thought it strange to not have a screen at least hanging down from the ceiling, but my hubby said he thinks they are doing away with all screens on planes as everyone has electronic devices they can use. This is only our 2nd flight ever on United and considering the class of tix, we think things went well. We'll see if our new United Mileage Plus Visa works out and we can use miles towards tix."
Mar 2020,30,'Insult to Injury' flight,"This was the longest flight I have ever taken at 7,400 miles. Unfortunately, it was an old plane with poor quality seats that wouldn't stay fixed in any given position. It took over 45 minutes just to do bag drop at check in. I was in a window seat where the side of the plane was so cold I had to wear my winter jacket with hat and mittens to stay warm - a first. We were served the worst dinner, lunch and breakfast meals (yes in that order) that I can recall on the over 1,600 flights I have flown on. It is rare for me not to eat everything served (just ask my family :)). I didn't finish any of these meals and we were lucky enough to have brought plenty of snacks on the flight. Finally to top it off, I only earned 800 frequent flier miles for this 7,400 mile flight....Overall I flew 17,157 miles on UA and its Star Alliance partners on this trip. I was 'rewarded' with only 4,417 total frequent flier miles. Then only 830 PQP towards status with their revised program. Just insult to injury...."
Mar 2020,40,Good experience,"I'll start by saying the obvious - first class is always pretty nice - but what made the flights really good had nothing to do with cabin class. The flights were smooth, uneventful and on-time. United staff was pleasant and helpful on the ground and in the air. I've had bad experiences with United in the past and still had my doubts when we booked our trip to Mexico, but the flights were great."
Mar 2020,50,Inexpensive airfare .,"Great I expensive airfare. Nice airline, no complications. We were assigned seats and our party of 3 were able to sit together . Will fly again"
Mar 2020,50,50th Aniversario of a cousin,"Everything excelent, the plane, allways in time, the crew with very nice attention during the fly on board and in the stops"
Mar 2020,30,Economy plus/bust,Never again...I paid nearly $400 for four flights of Economy Plus or whatever the upgraded economy is called and all you get is 2 inches extra of leg room and maybe a extra glass of tomato juice...maybe. Call me stupid...I deserve it.
Mar 2020,50,"Great staff ., Plenty of good entertainment for long haul flight and food satisfactory","Staff were very helpful and flight was perfect in both directions , Only issue is I could not sleep on the way back and think I would look at other flights rather than a night flight back"
Mar 2020,50,STL to IAD on Untied,For a relatively short fight (under 2 hours) on a smaller aircraft It was reasonably comfortable. Service was very good and the aircraft was clean.  St. Louis Lambert is a great airport to fly into and out of. It is compact and well organized. And never overly crowed.
Mar 2020,50,Outstanding Flight Experience,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the two flights on United that made up this international trip. The staff members of United were very friendly and accommodating. The staff members made us feel that they truly appreciated our business. Having such excellent flights on United made our travels even more enjoyable.
Mar 2020,30,Average Short Flight with very good check in process,"Nothing major to report, they did a great job in the check in (premier member), the flight was on time, clean plane, and good snacks."
Mar 2020,50,nonstop dc to honolulu,"yeah. not at all the cheapest option. took 2 infants, just got it over with. would do it again. and again"
Mar 2020,10,It didn't crash,"One star because we didn't crash - every other aspect of this flight was a nightmare:  1. even though I strictly followed the carry-on limitations, most passengers were required to check our carry-ons (even medical devices), and, upon landing, the airline personnel gave us incorrect info on where to pick up, and sent us racing from the departure gate to the baggage claim & back to the departure gate - causing inconvenience & losing valuable time.  2. the flight was jammed - not just a full capacity of passengers, but the plane was simply too small to carry the minimal amount of space that human bodies require. One passenger was well over 6ft tall, and there was not enough clearance for him to walk erect.  Besides the discomfort, I wonder how any safety regulations could allow such conditions to exist."
Mar 2020,20,Polaris Business Class SFO-LHR,"Very mixed experience - cabin service was poor. We spent two hours on the runway because of a passenger emergency before finally taking off . Nothing to be done about that. However, during those two hours not once did cabin crew offer a drink or anything else to business class passengers. Given that the Polaris cabin was less than half full, there seemed to be no excuse. When I asked if I could get a drink, after we had finally taken off and the sign was off, I was told that the drinks cart would be around before dinner. Really. Apart from poor beginning, the flight was uneventful and the service, once it started, passable. The food and wine were fine. The Polaris business seat was comfortable, if a little narrow. The entertainment system was disappointing, with no way with flag movies while browsing. The range of films was quite narrow - nothing like what you find on Singapore. Overall, quite a disappointing experience with United, primarily because of the cabin crew's neglect of passengers. Why pay to be neglected in business when I can have that for nothing in economy?"
Mar 2020,50,Pleasantly Surprised,Round trip flight on a new aircraft. Since I was flying basic economy I was expecting the worst but the flight exceeded my expectations. Food was average but I was pleased with everything else. The flights in both direction arrived ahead of schedule.
Mar 2020,40,"Good service, on-time","Reasonable service considering today's level of service across the industry. Nice leg room but for extra fee. Other than Southwest, booking a flight today is like buying a car - the options and fees are endless."
Mar 2020,50,Excellent International Travel Experience With United,"Had a connection in Houston of less than an hour. This made me a bit nervous, but everything went smoothly. Both flights on United were excellent without a single issue. The flights were smooth, the United staff was friendly, and arrivals were on time."
Mar 2020,30,Flying United better than most,"Flying United from LA to Boston which was the return leg of our flight was satisfactory. The flight was pleasant and smooth, and we got in a bit before our scheduled arrival. Sadly, like most airlines they have crammed more of us in and have the well established caste system in full working order. I remember when flying was part of the excitement of a trip. That is no longer the case, unless of course you fly business or first class. The flight attendants were professional and courteous and the cabin clean. I guess these days that about all you can ask for. I miss the old days, when the eats even in coach were comfortable, and meals were served and it was part of the enjoyment of traveling. Oh well."
Mar 2020,50,Flight Home,"My initial leg of the trip was departing from Tegucigalpa, Honduras flying to Houston. I only had a 1 hour layover until I caught my flight to Toronto. Both flights were very good. The staff were very nice and all in all it was a pleasant trip home. Thank you."
Mar 2020,20,Too many maintenance issues on flights between Milwaukee and Chicago.,"This was the first first leg of our trip to Key West, FL. About 2 hours before flight time we received a text that our flight was having maintenance problems and it wold be delayed 2 hours. Unfortunately, that would not have allowed us to make our connection on another United Flight. Fortunately, I was able to get online and they helped me find another flight that did allow us to make our connection.    On the return flight, same problem. The flight from Key West to Chicago was fine, but when we got on the plane in Chicago to return to Milwaukee the pilot suddenly told us a few minutes before takeoff time that there was a mechanical problem that was exposed during the safety checks. We sat on the airplane for about 2 hours waiting for a mechanic and getting it fixed. We were supposed to return to Milwaukee around 10:00 PM. We did not get here until about 12:30 AM."
Mar 2020,40,visiting family.,"I like to fly with United Airlines, they offer a good service.The food is good ,the crew are very attentive , they offer water all night.We no need to call .I had a good time in the air."
Mar 2020,30,Comfortable Business Class flight,"The upside - going to the Polaris Lounge at SFO. Very comfortable. Friendly personnel. Options for sit down meal service or buffet. Very nice bar. My husband was in a wheelchair and someone came and got us when it was time for us to leave the lounge and board. Downside - Boarding the plane was a find your own seat affair. No smiling, helpful flight attendants. They seemed to be cluttered in the galley and ignoring the boarding passengers. Not what I expected in business class. Another upside - The seats were very comfortable. Entertainment center at each seat offered many options. The lie flat seats made for a very comfortable flight (14+ hours in flight!). The pillows and blankets were wonderful. You can request a mattress pad to use when you decided to lay down. Plenty of room to store you personal items and carry on bag."
Mar 2020,50,Amazingly Pleasant 12 Hour Flight,"I give this United flight the highest rating. The flight left Tel Aviv just after 11 PM, and arrived in Newark after 4 AM, EST. So, the ""hours"" were awkward.    The passengers were well cared for. Two delicious meals, and a sandwich offered in between those meals. Excellent cabin crew, worked beautifully together. This is a ""sought for flight"" by the cabin crew. Spoke many languages. Water offered regularly.  A bottle of water was immediately given (no water in bottles was allowed from Tel Aviv) at start of trip.    I have never experienced a smoother landing."
Mar 2020,50,"Surprise- I rated United ""Excellant""","I have not flown United for many years; partially because Delta, Southwest & American are the major airlines in Ft. Myers and partially because they had become more of a ""discount"" airline with services geared to that market. As a business traveler, I need more than just a good fare. My experience last week to and from Chicago was outstanding. Planes were on time, clean and the attendants were first rate. Free DirecTV and WIFI for texts (I think for streaming as well but I did not use that) for all classes of passenger were great features. The fact that the flights were non-stop to and from RSW was a great bonus."
Mar 2020,40,Not too bad,"Boeing 767 aircraft was uncomfortable. Very small seats with very little room for legs. The seat in front is very close.  Airbus A300 was much better; newer, roomier, cleaner."
Mar 2020,50,Tampa,The staff was pleasent and the plane was on time. We got into Newark 15 minutes early...so all in all the smooth sailing.
Mar 2020,50,Great crew,"The crew was so wonderful especially the captain, very friendly and so nice. Took really great care of everyone..."
Mar 2020,50,United - safe and sound,"Though delayed, communications were good at the gate, and the Captain took charge when he arrived. On arrival, they could not open the airplane door from the outside, but Laquan, the flight attendant, knew how and said he was not supposed to, somehow it got done and we got off the plane. Was a short night of sleep but we were safe, the United staff were pleasant and it just added to one more travel adventure."
Mar 2020,40,"Regional jets are too small, larger planes have great services and comfort","Regional 50 seat jets are too tight, Im 6'4"" tall and had no leg room. The larger planes from EWR to STI (and return flight) were comfortable, and had entertainment screens. Employees were helpful and all flight legs were smooth and on time."
Mar 2020,50,Great Flight,I took this flight from San Francisco to New Delhi was a 15 hour flight nonstop. I didn’t have to change planes it was a wonderful flight they do serve India food. It might’ve been a long flight but it was so much easier not to have change planes at another airport
Mar 2020,40,relaxing,"The flight was a bit bump, but the captain make sure we all knew about the situation. what I did not like in the flight was not having audio in my chair. It took about 2 hours for them the reboot the system, too long in my opinion. One other thing was the food, it was very spice, I could not eat, neither the dinner nor the breakfast."
Mar 2020,30,Lesson learned!!,"I haven't taken a flight in years, so I just wasn't prepared for just how close the are now. The seat in front of me was practically in my lap! My husband is a big guy, I felt sorry for him! I raised my are rest, just so he could get a little more room. Airlines are squeezing in so many seats, it just makes air travel so uncomfortable! And to have to pay $30 a bag to check luggage, is ridiculous!! Pay the extra money to get a better seat and the ability to travel with a large carry-on. Lesson learned!!"
Mar 2020,50,"United Polaris class is amazing for long flights, with access to airport Polaris lounges, too!","Don't know if Polaris is considered business or first class, but it was amazingly wonderful. Cheap , it isn't, but if you have oodles of reward points and are willing to add several hundred dollars in addition, nothing beats flying Polaris for long flights -- the bed, the service, the space: wow! Also, you get to use the Polaris lounges at airports -- in Sydney, that lounge has not only complementary food, but showers as well.  The only downside: flying economy will be difficult after Polaris."
Mar 2020,30,Too many add on costs,"I chose to fly United because the original price was less expensive. However, after a charge for a seat assignment, baggage charges and fees, I was over my original budget. Make sure to read ALL fine print with United."
Mar 2020,10,"Rude Flight Attendant, no food and no inflight entertainment!","During this four hour flight we were offered the purchase of a snack box. I asked what was in the snack boxes and the male flight attendant pointed at the magazine in front of me. By the time I located the page and figured out what was in the boxes, he had moved on, never to return.    There were no in flight entertainment options on this flight, despite there being various options on the flight out the week before. On a good note, at least they didn't lose my luggage this time!"
Mar 2020,20,Very disappointed in United’s service,"We flew United for the first (and last) time in years. Their carry-on restrictions are ridiculous. Basically we couldn’t have any and were forced to check out carry on bags. The seats are narrower than ever and not comfortable. Bag fees are charged. There is minimal service.  I will not choose United again no matter how much cheaper their flights are. I’ve flown in Spirit, Allegiant and Southwest with Southwest being the best in recent years.  Very disappointed in United Airlines."
Mar 2020,50,Military Mission,Flight attendants were great seats could be better cusions were broken down. Other than that the flight was very good
Mar 2020,40,Friendly Staff,Very good flight with courteous and helpful staff. The food and service was good. The plane was clean
Mar 2020,10,Business training,Restrictions on carry ons made the flight and trip miserable. At least the airports were pleasant! Will not park at the airport again though. I can only hope for high speed trains in this country. It is too inconvenient to fly!
Mar 2020,50,Our Airline of Choice -- but this flight was delayed due to weather and then things broke on the plane,"It was very nice to find that United has a direct flight (not every day) to Grand Cayman where we went in January for a dive trip. Our afternoon take off was delayed because of bad weather in the states which had a domino effect on planes departing and returning to the States. Once we finally got on board we were told over the intercom that one of the bathrooms had a plumbing problem and had overflowed so only one toilet would be operational for the flight and be sure to wear your shoes if you went to that one. That was certainly disappointing although we were glad to finally depart. Although it wasn't announced, I found when ordering a drink that they weren't charging for it. That helped a bit. Normally we have excellent service with United and travel with them almost always, although their pricing is really getting out of hand."
Mar 2020,40,Great Flight and Service,"Great Flight with easy booking and check-in (on-line and at the airport), smooth flight and landing, adequate luggage retrieval. Seats and seat spacing remain too small and problematic. Airlines have lost their sanity with regards to customer comfort!    Baggage fees are ridiculous and do not reflect the reality of travelers on extended trips. If I could travel long distances without flying, I would.    Where are the general public's rights?"
Mar 2020,30,Average Skies,"Average experience, slow beverage cart service, luggage arrived a little late but no losses. Pilots were good at explaining details and gate arrivals."
Mar 2020,50,Great direct flight,We were Returning home from Florida at 6:00;pm it was a  Direct quick flight and very reasonable price we were very surprised that this was available on United but very happy that we found it.
Mar 2020,30,Typical Flight nothing above average,Delay Delay Delay. Spent 10 hours in the airport waiting.. Typical lack of real information. Seems all airlines are guilty of the same thing.
Mar 2020,30,My birthday,Service was ok. Didn't like that my wife & I was sitting separate. I have fly on different airlines but this was the worst.
Mar 2020,30,"Overall, not bad for cheap flights","Let's just say that I'm extremely thankful that I have to take medication to fly. I was able to sleep through all of my flights. However, this airline loves to cram as many people into its planes as possible. So while I was asleep most of the time, I was extremely cramped and ended up with excruciating back pain. My back pain finally ended, only in time for me to get back on a plane and come home. I'm not an overly tall person (5ft9in), and my knees touched the seat in front of me on every flight (2 stop route).  While I did make it there safely, and there were no issues with luggage or other people, the seats are hands down THE HARDEST, most uncomfortable seats I've ever experienced on an airline. Time for an update United!  I would only take this airline again if I absolutely had to."
Mar 2020,50,Gold flyer and got an upgrade to First Class,"I’m a gold member since my husband has flown 1,000,000 miles with United and chose me to be the companion flyer. (He’d better! Lol) This means we get priority boarding, upgrades, and free bags. The upgrade happened this time! Love it up there with actual silverware, unlimited drinks in a glass, bowl of warm nuts, and impeccable service. Had a chicken Caesar salad and wine. Very nice and comfortable experience."
Mar 2020,30,"Usually a dedicated United traveler, terrible experience in Lima","This flight is the only united flight between Lima and Newark daily, so if it is canceled or delayed, there is a major problem. Our 7 March flight was canceled due to mechanical problems, so after sitting on the runway for about an hour and a half we have to deplane, at which point it was 1am and they said, well the airport is closing and we will have to get your rebooked. So 200+ passengers later are standing in line for three people to help rebook at 1:30am. This isn't novel airline cancellation behavior, but just beware that this is the only United plane at this airport (I am pretty sure of this, it is the only United flight to the country daily from what I can tell) and it's not going to be easy for them to just find another plane. We were rebooked and ended up getting home only 12 hours after we were supposed to (and of course not sleeping for 36 hours or so), but I'm sure not everyone else was as lucky."
Mar 2020,50,No problems for me,"I generally travel solo. I realize not everyone can do that. As a society, we expect nothing but the best and too often it's someone else's fault for something not going right when we should be looking inward. Don't sweat the small stuff."
Mar 2020,40,Good amidst high winds,"Despite high winds it was a smooth flight both ways...a bit delayed leaving IAH to head home to EWR but the winds were rough. Pilot crushed it though, and the bumps were minimal! Great job!"
Mar 2020,30,Poor Service,"On our flight (also on United) to Puerto Vallarta, a flight attendant immediately distributed head sets to all passengers. However, on our return flight, no such offer was made, so I requested sets for my wife and myself. Almost two hours passed (during which food/drink service was made)....and no headsets. When i asked again, they finally came...now almost three hours into the flight. Beyond that, there were two screaming children in the row directly behind us...and not once did a flight attendant come to the distressed parents asking if they could help. Overall, I give the flight attendant “service” on that flight an “absent/failure” mark."
Mar 2020,50,None,"I usually fly out of Midway, but I needed to be at an event that afternoon near O Hare, so I looked at flights from there. Flying first class was $200 cheaper than coach out of Midway. The flight went like clockwork! And it was first class all the way!"
Mar 2020,50,Good flight,"plane left on time, arrived on time, crew was very pleasant and, there were no crying babies on the red-eye"
Mar 2020,30,Got us home,"Everything was as expected. Not great, but ok. Food was also ok. Took off on time and landed on time. No problem flying with them again if nothing better available."
Mar 2020,30,early but late,Flight service OK. Sound did not work on entertainment system so I watched basketball game. Filght landed 10 minutes early when flight tracker said it was 15 minutes late. Didn't matter much...baggage conveyor broke and had to wait 45 minutes on my bag
Mar 2020,50,Great steward on our flight,"Our steward, Boudreaux, did everything in his power to make us and the passengers around us feel safe, happy and cared for. The man never stopped smiling! He made me laugh out loud several times!"
Mar 2020,20,Damaged luggage,"Somehow the UA baggage handlers managed to put a large tear in the toughest material on my checked luggage. See photo.    I've flown many many flights all over the world (1st and 3rd world) and never seen my bag as abused as this. What person, tool or machine handles bags with such force and penetration that a 2 inch gouge is taken out?    Add to that the incredibly crappy snack service."
Mar 2020,40,Not excellent,"Nice flight direct on-stop to Newark. Service just can't compare with Qutar, lufthanas, Turkish or Emirates. Service on these airlines is GREAT. They are very attentive to your needs and do an excellent job! US airlines just can't compete. But give credit to United for trying. They need to train staff to be more involved and attentive to business class clients. When you fly the others lines, restrooms are always keep clean. Will only fly US airlines when I have no other option."
Mar 2020,40,USA to Ukraine,"Comfortable and on time. Airline made a few changes....going through Warsaw, Poland instead of Vienna, Austria but overall great flight."
Mar 2020,30,Pre checking baggage was a bust!,"I was traveling with a large group, and It was recommended by travel agent to precheck our baggage. After Multiple attempts, most of us were unable to precheck or ended up getting charged for extra bags. We almost missed our flights as there were very few United personnel working and they had to check in bags or make refunds. Their computer seemed to constantly glitch! Same on the way back we had the same situation! Otherwise flight was good, the basic economy seats were definitely roomier than American Airlines and baggage came right away with no lost bags for a group of 72!"
Mar 2020,40,Good flight but crazy experience!,The original flight I booked was changed several times! Due to weather there was a delay on way home. Some said the flight was cancelled and some said it wasn't. No one had the correct answers and it kept changing with each person we spoke to. We did get home that night on the scheduled flight but just the unknown was frustrating!
Mar 2020,20,Not a fan,"United has just gotten worse and worse in my opinion. First, they nickel and dime you for everything. On many flights, one even has to pay extra for carry-ons! Also, I had to pay $25 per seat, just so my wife and I could sit near each other in the plane, on this particular flight. Then, at least three times during the flight, they were making pitches for the purchase of a UA credit card!  Also, while this was a non-stop flight, and about 4.5 to 5 hours, there was no meal offered....only extra expense meals. If I don't have to travel United, I will do everything in my power not to.  And it may be trivial, but the entertainment offering was terrible! Old, tired movies and tv shows....just a terrible selection. And in the sections where we had to sit, we couldn't even charge phones.  Also, the interior of the plane was just dirty. Everywhere I looked, crumbs from the last trip, there was even trash in the seat back in front of me."
Mar 2020,50,Great flight,Got to airport 30 minutes before flight and was trasnferred to a later flight. Original flight I had one stop. With resceduled flight I was given a non-stop flight.
Mar 2020,40,Winter Flight,We liked this flight because it was non-stop and the plane was not crowded. We enjoyed plenty of shoulder room. The free movies made time go by quickly. What we didn’t like were the baggage fees. There was no option to carryon any baggage (only one back pack allowed per person).
Mar 2020,40,Everything worked,"Sometimes the wifi and entertainment doesn't work on United, but this time everything worked as advertised, including their United app. There were no electrical outlets below the seat, however. But overall it was a pleasant flight with an empty middle seat. Flight was also on time."
Mar 2020,10,Terrible customer service at check in,"The flight was actually on February 29. We were going to Minneapolis to pick up a new car and for my companion to work a 30 day assignment. We decided to upgrade to first class. We had extensive conversations with two different service representatives on two different phone calls and were told that we would have an allowance of six bags total, two for my companion who had successfully upgraded, two previously purchased when we were coach plus and two for my status (I wasn’t sure about that ). We were rudely informed the information was incorrect, and charged very high fees. One agent, Toni, was particularly rude. I will avoid United whenever I can.  The flight crew was wonderful. They helped get rid of the sour taste from the desk agent.  I understand they have a tough job dealing with people. That being said I am not used to being treated so poorly. I really began to wonder what ever happened to the friendly skies of United Airlines."
Mar 2020,40,Uneventful flight,"This flight was as uneventful as they come -- the way we like them. As expected, the basic economy is helpful in the cost department, but passengers are packed in. Thankfully, it was a short flight that left and arrived on time."
Mar 2020,20,Flight was worse than other airline’s economy class,"The lounge at San Francisco was amazing, one of the best I’ve seen in the US, with a great restaurant and bar, enough seating and space for everyone. The flight was a different story. The seat was the new layout with private pods, it was comfortable, but already showed signes of wear even though they are very new. My seat had candy and crumbs all over it, it was filthy. There was no hot towel or drink upon entry or for two hours after boarding. The flight attendant taking food orders was not friendly and told everyone to pick two options in case their preference was gone. The food was thrown down on a plastic tray and there was no wine list. When I asked what type they had the description was just red or white and which country it came from and the one I tried was not good. When I asked for a beer later in the flight they were all out. The flight was understaffed and the service was not well thought out. I would go out of my way to avoid this flight and airline for business class travel in the future, there are much higher quality airlines that fly the same route for the same price or less."
Mar 2020,50,Appreciate their efforts to get all luggage and gear to destination!,"Recently returned with 24 members of my local ski club from a trip to Banff, Canada. Our plane from Calgary was small, so baggage capacity was limited and overhead space small. With so much ski and snowboarding gear, there was a larger than normal amount of baggage and gear to get on the plane. The handlers made every effort to get all gear and luggage on the plane, bringing small bags into the cabin to place in available overhead space. Kudos!!"
Mar 2020,40,High in the Clouds,"Flight was smooth and service was standard. However, when I asked for a blanket they stated that they did not have any and then magically one appeared. As I was leaving the plane I noticed many more blankets in seats. The crew was cordial when handing out our pretzel and soda. Check in at the gate was ok. The overhead luggage filled up and my suitcase had to be checked in. Directions on where to leave my luggage was hard to follow. I had an empty cup to pour my drinks in so that I could take it with me. The flight attendants joked with me about hanging onto my cup. Did not know how to work the movie until the last 30 minutes of the flight because the instructions were not clear due to the interruptions from the captain. Seat left me cramped. The bathroom was so small and the hand washing was difficult to maneuver while standing. Direct flights are always better."
Mar 2020,50,California Trip,I traveled with my 88 year old mother. Requested assistance for her. Service was excellent wheelchair was waiting for her as we deplaned
Mar 2020,10,Delays,"Extreme delays, multiple gate changes. Very exhausting. Also very hungry because estimated time kept changing so I didn’t dare get anything to eat. Close to 24 hrs and just a few snacks that I had brought."
Mar 2020,50,Nice flights from SFO to IAH,We took a flights between SFO and IAH in February. They were both the hubs of UA. The flights were excellent with on time departures and earlier arrivals. The services were good. Everything was perfect.
Mar 2020,30,No airline I've flown has really comfortable seating. United was no exception,"The seats were narrow and the arm rest was narrow, and poorly designed and I kept changing the channel on my seat mate's video by leaning on the arm rest. Of course there was only food to buy except a single small package of cookies. Wait staff was pleasant but disengaged, and who can blame them. People are so annoyed with the price of baggage checking that they stuffed the overhead bins with roll on bags. My small backpack had to go under the seat of me, leaving no space for my feet."
Mar 2020,40,United Rio-Houston-Salt Lake City,"Trecho Rio Houston Boeing 767-400 muito bom. Houston Salt Lake City, Airbus 319 velhinho.... Sem entretenimento"
Mar 2020,30,United just doesn't get it.,"Nothing new or different. One thing that I don't like about United is that they won't let you change seats without paying. Flight to Cozumel was about half empty and everyone had to stay in their assigned seats. Generally United is a crummy airline, but was cheap enough and got us there. Service was good."
Mar 2020,40,Straight flight to Puerto Vallarta,"Bumpy flight both ways, but comfortable seating. Service was good. Baggage was expensive, checked two bags both ways. Even though I saved on the flight, with baggage it came to approximately the same. So not as good of savings as I had originally estimated. Slightly disappointing."
Mar 2020,40,Delayed flight handled well,My flight on Feb. 17th was canceled due to mechanical problems with the plane. All in all United handle this unforeseen circumstances well. They put us in hotel and gave us vouchers for food. The process to get the voucher was grueling especially with a sick wife. After getting voucher we went to a bus that had to be full before we left for our hotel/. At this point because of my wife illness and we where in the airport for 10 hours we took a cab our hotel was about 40 minutes away.
Mar 2020,10,Never Again,"The only airline to charge for a carry on bag. The plane was filthy having dirty trays, seats and bathrooms. I will avoid United when possible."
Mar 2020,50,United has gotten better,"I stopped using United for around 2 yrs. They were just bad. Losing bags,flight delays no on board entertainment.  In February 2020 I had to fly roundtrip to LAX from EWR and EWR to SJU  Both flights were full. However we left on time,arrived early on all 4 flights But here is the big thing My checked bag was out in minutes! Yes are the seats tight ( I refuse to pay for upgrade) of course. They also had FREE entertainment I will begin to use United again"
Mar 2020,50,Nice flight to Puerto Rico,"Plane was clean, flights were on time. Staff was helpful and friendly. Received snacks on flight, free movies and WiFi was great for the kids!"
Mar 2020,40,Overall good flight,"On time, flight crew pleasant, took care of passengers first, bumpy ride, made sure we were safe. Good crew."
Mar 2020,40,airtrip,Excellent flights and great crew all around.  Take care of passengers with personality and sense of humor.  Only drawback is the long walk from exiting plane to next gate at Newark. Miles....
Mar 2020,50,Great Handicap Service,Excellent handicap service at O'Hare. Easiest travel assistance ever! Entered at the Handicap gate and they took over with great assistance to the gate.
Mar 2020,40,Food nonstop flight,"We flew nonstop by Boeing 787-9 from SFO to AMS. Good seats, inflight entertainment. Enough leg space (average height/weight).Flight attendances very good. An extra service was at the airport, where we could drop our luggage at the entry of the airport."
Mar 2020,30,Need better planning for Gates,"I have never really had a problem flying with United until this last trip. Everything was great leaving Atlanta as well as in flight. The problems started when we landed in Newark. We had landed early and our gate was still occupied. In my opinion, not a big deal. The pilot came on and informed us of a 10 minute delay. 20 minutes later he came back on and said the plane was stuck in our gate and had requested a new one. Bottom line, we finally deplaned 1 hour after landing. To me this was unacceptable and better planning in need in the future. Several people on my flight missed their connecting flights due to this. Despite landing 30 mins early our flight was deemed late because of the gate issue."
Mar 2020,40,was regular,was just fine the price was cheaper when i book it 4 mouth earlier  so was based on price and the airport location
Mar 2020,50,Long but comfortable,"We took a 13.5 hour flight from San Francisco to Auckland, New Zealand. The combination of comfortable seats, long nighttime, and noise canceling headphones allowed me a few hours of sleep. We still had plenty of time to watch 2 movies and relax."
Mar 2020,40,Flying with ESA,I always fly united with my small ESA. They accommodate and make it as easy as possible considering flying these days. Highly recommend.
Mar 2020,50,Pleasant experience,"This flight was actually a pleasant experience with United. I hadn’t flown United in over 5 years due to numerous reasons. The first being delays, their uncomfortable seating, and horrid employees, but all that has changed. We were on time to and fro, and though we sat in basic economy, their seats weren’t to small and I had leg room. Their employees from the check in process all the way to arrival were fantastic. They seemed to enjoy their jobs! The highlight was watching movies with their previously downloaded app."
Mar 2020,50,Easy Peasy Flight,"These flights ran like clockwork. Ontime and smooth sailing. Not bad for small airport to small airport with only one layover (Chicago). Fortunately, weather was in our favor."
Mar 2020,10,Regional jets are the worst,"United continues to fly tiny, uncomfortable planes that don't even use gates. You deplane on the tarmac- in the rain or snow and it is just ridiculous. But the price is often higher than larger planes used by competition. There is no in flight entertainment and often not even beverage service."
Mar 2020,50,Smooth and professional,"Although very full the crew was effective, pleasant and helpful. On way back arrived almost an hour early."
Mar 2020,50,Great Service,"When flying during the night, I try to get 1st class on the way to my destination so I’m not as tired when I start the day. United has always treated me so well, and feel like they really care about their passengers.  On the way back I sat in row 29 where I had a couple with a fussy baby, but the nicest young couple! The flight attendant saw the stress from their body language and the exhaustion as our flight was delayed due to mechanical issues. The flight attendant walked the baby up and down the isle so the couple could get some relief only for a few minutes. To me, this not only showed how the United staff cares, but they treat us like family! This truly warmed my heart. I’m a true and true United loyalist!"
Mar 2020,50,Heading To The Beach,"Our departure was on time and the crew did an excellent job during the flight! And we landed earlier than scheduled! It was a very smooth flight as was our landing in Cancun!  So, I ask - what more could you as k for?!"
Mar 2020,50,A FLIGHT THAT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS!,"Well I never thought I would be able to share a flight experience that was better than expected.  Check in was well resourced, efficient and the queue well managed. the crew were polite and attentive and unlike some US airlines not just there for the pay cheque.  the biggest surprise was the quality of the basic economy food. It was not just edible but actually enjoyable! I was so taken aback that I complemented the steward.  The plane left on time and arrived on time and my bags were reunited with me in good time as well.  I will use them again"
Mar 2020,50,South America Vacation,"i flew from Ottawa to Toronto and then from Toronto to Houston and then to Bogota. I will say this, the flights were comfortable and the staff were very professional and friendly. I would recommend this Airline, i was very satisfied. Just a note , if flew this route once before with United and the trip was the same, Excellent"
Mar 2020,50,smooth sailing into paradise,food and drinks came quickly and were refreshing and tasty... stewardesses were friendly and helpful with immigration paperwork and everything else... good choice of movies... free earbuds... but save them for the return trip! great service united!
Mar 2020,40,personal service touch for our son Sybe,"the cabin crew was very service minded, very specific to our son Sybe; he would like to become a pilot, so the stewardess introduced him to captain in the cockpit before the push back at Schiphol; wonderful;  and also we enjoyed the seat ptich in the B767, 2 - 4 -2, so we had seats for mom and daughter and direc behind for dad and son.  so an easy ride to the States"
Mar 2020,40,United direct DIA-IAD -,"The flight was delayed 2 hours and they had to send a new plane from MN. The actual flight was smooth and they made up some time getting there. since this was a direct flight, no missed connection s."
Mar 2020,50,Perfect flight to Atlanta,"The flight was full despite Corona virus scare. The salon was clean, the service is the same as usual. We arrived 30 minutes earlies, everything was good."
Mar 2020,10,No entertainment to Hawaii maui,"Flight attendants tell us entertainment doesn’t work. We tried it both ways, does not work. Only from Minneapolis to Denver. Hawaii trios no go.  Choose a different airline or come prepared.  Super frustrating!!!"
Mar 2020,30,Transfer was a major problem,"The actual flight was OK, however although it was a international flight [Mexico to USA] no meal was included. The plane was only about a third full so there was plenty of room to stretch out. The problems came when we arrived at LA where I had to connect to another United flight to Sydney two hours later. We came into Terminal 7 and just before landing we were told that our luggage would have to be collected at Tom Bradley Terminal so we had to go there by bus and then also go through immigration before collecting luggage. United terminal staff didn't seem to understand the procedure so it took some time to get to and go through that terminal. I then had to check in for my next flight at Tom Bradley before waiting some time for the terminal bus back to Terminal 7. I just managed to get there on time. I was a nervous wreck!"
Mar 2020,20,Disappointing travel yet again on United,"My husband and I have been to Hawaii now for the 3rd time. We are getting older and the flight back home to the east coast at night is really hard so this time we ""splurged"" for Business First to get us out of Honolulu to Denver on the first leg. We flew economy plus back to the east coast. When I booked the ticket, I tried desperately to use the > 250K miles to defray the cost. Ha! Not to possible. I must share that I fly business class around the world on various airlines (KLM, Ethiopian Air, Emirates, British Airways, etc) for work and thought the ""lay flat seats"" would help us both weather the night travel from Hawaii to Denver. The first thing I did not know is that even though we were flying ""first class"", we were not allowed to use the lounge in Honolulu because it was not an international flight. I never knew this was a condition. But we walked really far in the terminal only to get to United's lounge and as a ""silver"" member, I could not use my points for the lounge but could pay $69 for each of us to use the lounge. I declined. Ok, my bad not to know that this was the case. So then we get on the 6.5 hour flight and 1) they had no ""amenity"" kits so we had no ear plugs or eyeshades. I would have brought those had I known. I've been on shorter flights internationally and they always have them. Then, when we didn't want a ""meal"" but just some nuts or cheese, they did not have that either. They said they could get us some ""trail mix"". In addition, my husbands in flight entertainment did not work. Our goal was to sleep. And of course the bathroom sink two rows back had a problem with the drain and made a horrible noise for the entire flight. If we'd had earplugs, maybe this would not have been a problem. Then for breakfast, there was a cold scone. Again, I have traveled shorter segments internationally even on United and got far better service. You'd think an American airline would treat the domestic passengers at least as well as the international ones. Having traveled the world for 10 years, I hate to say it but I despise traveling on US airlines due to the poor quality. Sad state of affairs."
Mar 2020,10,Horrible Customer Service,"United Airlines has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I had a flight booked for myself and one other person and all I needed to do was cancel the other individuals flight as they could no longer attend the trip. I went to uniteds website and followed the instructions as to do so. Got everything to the point and all I needed to do was hit cancel. I hit cancel and an error pops up saying I need to call and contact them. So I call and contact them, I wait on hold for over an hour. Then the person I talk to ask if this is regarding my domestic flight. Which I said no it was for an international flight. He informs me that he has not been trained in international flights so he needs to transfer me to someone else. I thought it would be an instant transfer since I have already been on hold for over an hour. Nope, I had to sit on the phone for over another hour. I am honestly writing this review right now while I am on hold with United Airlines. Because this is how much time I have while being on hold. It is just absolutely ridiculous to make someone wait an hour and then have someone answer the phone who isn't even trained. Mind you they do not even offer an option for selecting domestic or international when you call. First and last time I will be dealing with United Airlines."
Mar 2020,50,"Took off early, landed very early","Admittedly, this was not a full flight, probably about 40% full. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant experience, as pleasant as 5+ hours can be on a plane. The service was nice, and personable. They came around with drinks, food offerings, and then with water several times. My wife and I were in the Exit Row with no one between us and it was very comfortable.    I look forward to my next similar flight on United."
Mar 2020,10,Took off early without me,"My flight was scheduled for takeoff at 2:05 from ABQ to IAH. Oddly enough, United began texting me several hours before the flight saying ""see you soon"". I arrived at the airport in ample time, checked my luggage and got a boarding pass. The agent stated boarding would begin at 1:40. I grabbed a coffee and proceeded to the TSA checkpoint. They delayed my progression somewhat. I arrived at the gate at 1:50 and the door was closed and locked. I banged on the door and no one responded. I waited 10 more minutes and an agent emerged from the locked door and said the flight had already left. It was 2:02. The agent was unapologetic and said she had called my name on the PA speaker (if she had, her accent was so thick I am sure I would not have understood). She said boarding only lasts 10 minutes! I had to wait an extra 3 hours and 40 minutes for the next flight. I noted that a subsequent text said they began boarding at 1:34. In times past, I would have received a free flight in compensation. Hope to take Southwest on my next trips."
Mar 2020,40,Comfortable flight in business class round trip to Osaka,"It is flat bad, decent video screen, and good food. The seats is not as large as some other airlines though, and there is not many space by the seat to put in your belongs such as glasses, iphone and iPad, wallet etc. overall it is quite good."
Mar 2020,40,Great Airline,"We flew down there on Feb 19 and returned a week later on Feb 26. We were on our way to Playa del Carmen, Mexico and Cancun id the nearest International airport. The hotel arranged transport for use ( The Hilton All inclusive, adults only hotel for a very reasonable price of $140, I did not want to rent a car as it would cost much more and the last time I drove myself in Cancun we were stopped by a policeman for running a red light, which I didn't do and the policeman demanded a $100 upfront otherwise I would have to go before a magistrate. I forked over the $100 right away (and my wife was very surprised). When I got home I googled the event that I had been through, and I found that if I had appeared in front of a magistrate it would have cost be a lot more, because I would have also had to pay him off!  I chose the cheapest option!"
Mar 2020,50,West coast trip,Very pleasant and comfortable trip. Changed terminals in Denver that was not expected. The shuttle made it easy.
Mar 2020,20,Terrible Customer Service,The flight attendants were busy with their Surfing and shopping on Web. In the 15 hours flight time - they did not even ask once for water. Food was terrible would not feed it to my dog
Mar 2020,50,Great travel through United,"a last minute trip I was scrambling for a decent fare to go visit my family. United provided a basic economy fare for good value. I was able to check a bag at additional routine cost. the tray table was decent size and the snack/soda options were at no additional cost. * I mention this as comparison to other airlines who also have a fair no frills price, and NO FRILLS is the key. But hey, it was great travel, I appreciated the text prompts to remind me to check in and boarding info. all was great!!"
Mar 2020,40,Multi stop - Better than expected,"Just completed MAN-EWR-SFO-AKL return over in January and was for the most part pleasantly surprised. All 6 flights were on time and the baggage rechecks in EWR and on the Return in SFO worked well and were complete inside of 60 minutes (gate to skycap), EWR particularly efficient . The flights themselves had attentive crews and the international legs good catering , the AVOD has a great selection and worked but assume the USB ports may not function , this is not a problem exclusive to UA. On the MAN-EWR-MAN expect a main meal and either a sandwich or a croissant and Yoghurt. The US transcons are pay for food but they did 4 runs and your soft drinks are free along with meagre snacks. The Transpacs had 2 full meals and snacks and the snacks are left out if your are still hungry in the front galley. You don't get menus , the drinks runs are usually bottled water in between. Legrooms good, but 787s are cramped (Once again most 787s are). On the transcons ensure you pack cabin bags light as unless you are Star alliance ASSUME you won't get overhead space.the issues were minor and UA left me with a good impression when compared with VS/LH and BA long haul."
Mar 2020,50,What United can and should be,"We flew on February 29, 2000 for a quick week in London. Upgraded to Polaris round trip. I was excited because on the outgoing flight, I'd become a Million Miler on United. My wife got this status a couple of years before.    As we were waiting to depart, Renee, one of the flight attendants told me of the million mile status and congratulated us. It was a very nice spontaneous gesture.    Service throughout the flight was excellent. We've flown United many times, for many years. This was one of the best flights ever."
Mar 2020,50,New and Improved United Airlines: Unexpected level of service,"A splurge for us is usually premium economy but we took advantage of current airplane travel and flew business both ways with a “day of” upgrade. Although I would expect good service in a far from full business section, I felt that the flight attendants went way beyond satisfactory and were exceptionally helpful.  Also, the new United planes used for international travel are as wonderful as the old domestic United planes were awful. The sleeping configuration is very clever and the seat really does flatten out to allow a bed-like feel. (Well, perhaps I’m easily impressed.). I opted for the Asian meals both ways and was impressed with the sophistication and quality of the meal. Ditto the wine. Finally, the in-flight entertainment system was a step up from the norm."
Mar 2020,10,New United refund policy,BEWARE! United just changed its refund policy: they can change the time of your flight up to 25 hrs (1day!) without allowing you to ask for a refund. That’s buying one product and being given a completely different product. I can’t believe this is legal!
Mar 2020,30,Basic Economy,If you are traveling by yourself this isn’t bad way to travel but they do make you pay for everything! Like come on a carry on? We paid $300 round trip plus $60 for 2 check in bags. I haven’t decided if I would fly with United again.
Mar 2020,20,They need lessons from the other airlines,What a convenient flight to get to USA. Nice having to be able to take 2 bags.  But the service and food leaves a lot to desired. Most of the hostesses are past retirement age. Also scratching in your hair whilst serving food is a no no. The food was horrible and luckily we had taken our own sandwiches with.
Mar 2020,10,Worst travel experience. If I could give 0 stars I would.,"Recently flew United for the first time ever only due to flight departure time. I normally fly Southwest and they will continue to be my go to airline. My husband and I traveled with our young daughter and simply asked the agent at the check in counter at SFO to accommodate our seats so that we would be seated together. He refused to even attempt to look into the available seats on the plane to make said accommodation. Something as simple as moving 1 seat to have us together is not much of a request.  This airline only cares to nickel and dime its passengers. If I paid for our seats they can guarantee grouped seats, but if I did not pay for seats there is no way to have grouped seats. How does this even make sense?! The grouped seats are only available if payment is involved!  The same seat numbers I was automatically generated for free could have been made available together but only if I paid an additional fee. How is this even right?!  Never again will this company gain my business. I will never recommend this airline to ANYONE!"
Mar 2020,50,United Airlines,"I traveled after taking care of my ill father-in-law. My experience was very positive. The ease of making the reservation, the great price of the ticket, the friendliness and great customer service of all the United Airlines staff was top notch."
Mar 2020,50,Best Flight and Cree,"I have had the pleasure of traveling on the United non-stop from Denver to Cancun for the third time in 4 years and every single time the flights have left on time, the flight crew are so professional and attentive if needed and all of our bags make it. I highly recommend this flight and airline."
Mar 2020,10,"Delays, missed connections....",We were delayed several time due to mechanical issues. We missed a connecting flight due to delays.When we finally landed in Chicago we couldn’t get to the gate due to another broken plane. Spent an entire day in airports. Finally arrived in Miami at 1:00 am. I will look at other airlines in the future.
Mar 2020,40,"Early morning flight from Houston, TX to Denver, CO","The boarding process went well. The aircraft had 6 across seating in coach with comfortable seats and adequate legroom for my 6'2"" frame. There was an entertainment console in the seat back. The flight crew was negligent in their primary function--safety. The person in front of me had her seat back during takeoff and not only did the attendant miss that, she also did not notice me with my hand waving in the air. All I need is for the plane to need to make an emergency stop and have me lurch forward and hit my head on a reclined seat. The flight did arrive on time."
Mar 2020,20,Family Holiday,This would have to be the worst flight I have ever been on. The staff were so rude and dismissive. Never again!!!
Mar 2020,10,The worst airline on the planet,"I flew United business class from Frankfort to DC last night, and am currently waiting for a connecting flight to Asheville on its third delay, now scheduled to board at the original destination arrival time. Third delay so far.  I have flown business class on Delta, Lufthansa, Thai, Cathay Pacific, Nippon, Korea Air, British Airways and Singapore, and i have never had a worse international business class experience than United. seats were dirty, uncomfortable, and the electronics wonky. The food was awful, and they didnt have either of my first two meal choices. The meal i did get tasted like a microwaved hot pocket. Service, even in business class was surly, unhelpful, and acted exasperated about having to deal with passengers. I cancelled a Cathay Pacific flight with a Hong Kong connection due to coronavirus fears and flew with United through Frankfort instead. In retrospect i would rather have coronavirus than fly with this terrible airline again."
Mar 2020,30,flight with too many stops,"over flight was ok just too many stop overs, too save money. United aircraft vary in what available such as movies, and food is pretty much not available only really snacks, but very typical for american airlines now."
Mar 2020,30,Zihuatanejo,"We accidentally found a non stop to ZIH which gladly solved our problem of how to get to our destination without the hassle of chamging planes or staying overnight after Delta quit flying non stop from Minneapolis. Good flight, nothing above average. No snacks offered before or after drinks other than our meal which is a little unusual for Business Class. Delta does offer a nice snack basket more than onces during flight (or at least they did last year)."
Mar 2020,40,Not to bad of a flight length,Flying in and out of Aruba is best recommended during the week. Pretty quick getting through security coming in but coming back definitely takes time getting through the lines and then again through U.S. customs. Definitely would not want to go through the lines on the weekends when timeshares are turning over. Plus side is once you land in the U.S. catching connecting flights is easier and time saving without having to go through customs.
Mar 2020,50,The staff was very responsive and I like how efficient they board everyone!!,Excellent flight and services!! Leg room can be improved!!! I cannot think of anything else at this time!!
Mar 2020,30,Lacking in so many ways!,We flew exactly 5 weeks ago to Sydney stayed 2 weeks in Australia and flew the exact same route back to United States. In my opinion all US airlines are lacking with cleanliness and service. This virus that has gripped all was already in the making and yet when I asked if the airline was doing extra cleaning or lysol etc - the flight attendant said no - I think most have now inacted some measures! The bathroom stalls looked like someone had put small white feathers all over the floor in the bathrooms - I don't know what the schedule is for cleaning them but it smelled and didn't seem like they swept the floor from toilet paper pieces the whole 17.5 hour trip - the other thing they lack is no eye contact with passengers once they have served the main meal - I had to ring the button anytime I needed a drink of something! Other foreign airlines for example Singapore etc can't do enough for you. I also left my scarf on the flight (my bad) but they have to know who was sitting in that business class seat - very disappointed to not be able to get back. All this said we did have 2 of the Business class attendants who were trying to be friendly and helpful! The others seemed tired before our flight even left Houston. We also flew business class for our return to states from Houston to TIA - I can't believe the choice of snacks you are offered - what happened to something low carb and healthy like some cheese and crackers - the only reason to fly business domestically is leg room! US airlines in general really could do so much better!
Mar 2020,40,Mexico - Denver Trip,"UAL Customs process in Denver was so much more efficient than a previous customs trip going thru Atlanta.  The staff for UAL was very helpful and made the process seem very smooth, even though we only had an hour to make connections - we made it!"
Mar 2020,50,Best Counter Agent,"Missed our flight due to horrible, long security line (I forgot this was Spring Break weekend) and was stressed about missing my Grandma's 100th birthday. David Y at United Airlines counter in Columbus, OH was wonderful and found us a new flight without any issues. He was so friendly and calm that he took my high anxiety level from a 10 to a 2. Thank you for your amazing customer service and helping us be there for my Grandma's special day!!"
Mar 2020,20,Polaris Business Class is good but service is pale,"Took a sharing flight with ANA / UA. But UA deserve some comments here. The Polaris class is very nice, good leg room with comfortable seat. The inflight entertainment has numerous movies. But the service from the air stewardess is like going to a fast food restaurant. There is only 1/4 of the business class fill and I sit at row 5. The lady has the cheek to ask what food I like to eat and only one choice. Then she claimed there is nothing left since it is not a full flight. I wanted the jap meal and the jap customer which is at row 10 get it while I was there first and got rejected. She gave the other customers mask and dun even bother to ask me. In the whole flight, there was never smiles and greeting. If I want a fast food service, I would have pay economy.... I can't even compare this with ANA, emirates and Singapore airline.... Kudos to UA for deciding to be so bad...."
Mar 2020,10,"Terrible airlines , never flies on time","Ended up sitting at airport for more than 2 hours , they keep on postpone your flight time , saying some air traffic issues. Spirit and united airlines sucks your time and schedule."
Mar 2020,50,So much better than Delta,"After flying in an old delta plane for far more money on my America trip 12 months prior, this United flight was completely incomporable. The middle seat next to me was free which made for a very comfortable flight. In-flight entertainment was vast with a responsive touch screen and easy to navigate menu. The seats were comfortable and the windows had no shutters. The staff were helpful and allowed me to fill up my water bottle with the filtered water provided. I also only paid $1255 return!  Would fly again without a shadow of a doubt. Highly recommended"
Mar 2020,20,United Sucks... again,"I’m booked this evening on UA1566; a direct from Dulles to Mexico City. It’s supposed to depart at 5:10 pm, and United happily texted me for the last 24 hours telling me about my departure. Unfortunately, they waited until I was going through Security to notify me that the flight would be delayed until 6:35 pm because of an out-of-service aircraft. Super helpful.    Now, they have delayed the flight until 7:30 pm. It’s beyond the point where there are any quicker options. I’ll now sit in the terminal for more than 4 hours before boarding.    If only we were at a United hub... oh, wait, we are. Sad."
Mar 2020,40,Quite good and comfy!,"We got good $ tickets to lax. Really liked the easy wipe down seats. ( not a fan of the fabric seating as it’s hard to clean and sanitize). Quite a lot of leg room, good shows to watch and good staff"
Mar 2020,40,Everything went as planned. Very happy,"Our flight went as planned. No delays. No problems. The people were courteous and helpful. We would rather the price be better, but all worked well."
Mar 2020,50,New experience,"I flew a lot of routes to USA to get to Oklahoma almost all with American airlines not this time, this time I flew with United no extra stop in London which was a nice plus also I was extremely surprised that they have 2 Dutch speaking pursers on board..not that I need it but I know loads do..the service was given with a smile there was room so we were able to lay down nobody got woken up for wishywashy stuff all and all a quick and nice flight no looking at the clock like are we there yet Thank you United see you next time way back was just as well organized and well serviced"
Mar 2020,30,I had a decent flight but wireless features didn't work.,"I had a total of 4 flights with United Airlines for this trip. Fortunately, I did not encounter any delays, which was great. In general, service was decent. However, on one of the flights (from SFO to YVR), because it did not have a monitor for entertainment, there was a sign to use your own device by using the plane's wireless feature. Although I had my app downloaded on my phone, I was unable to use this service, which was very disappointing. I had a same problem with this wireless service before too, so I was not surprised, but at the same time, I hope they fix this issue in the future, or I would fly with other airlines. Also, same flight, because it was a full flight, flight attendants were asking people to put their backpacks and coats under their seats instead of the upper compartment to fit larger carry on items. People were not listening, so I understand the flight attendant's frustration, but one of them had a rather rude attitude towards people. Watching this, it made me miss Japanese service (very respectful and calm) already although I just left Japan."
Mar 2020,40,UA,We fly Untited Airlines often. Planes are always clean and nice in our opinion. We wish they had better service to the Caribbean from Houston.
Mar 2020,10,I guess I'm in good company,"Was supposed to fly United from NH to FL. Was not meant to be. Stood in line with a lot of other unhappy United airlines customers, and was told by a very nice and patient rep that my 2 flights were cancelled. No explanation other than they had issues with the crew. Perhaps there was no pilot. That could be problematic 🙄 Was booked on an American airlines flight, that left 2 hours later than planned.    Not quite sure what's going on with United, but they've gone downhill"
Mar 2020,30,seats uncomfortable and entertainment lacking,The seats are very uncomfortable...I guess they hope you will fly 1st class on future flights! Crew was nice and generous with refreshments however were unable to assist us when the in-flight entertainment wouldn't work. 6 hours with no movies or music in a hard seat was not a lot of fun! On the return trip I tried to get assistance before the flight to ensure I was doing everything right but no one could help me. Frustrating! Others were able to watch movies although not without some glitches.
Mar 2020,40,"It’s alright, it gets you there",The area at the gates is quite cramped; with many tables where you can order food and drinks from the tablets. There’s lots of movement with not much space to just sit and wait till time to broad.  The flight itself was uneventful. Two rounds of drinks were served. Do not remember getting any snacks.
Mar 2020,50,Round trip to Phoenix,"This is a trip I take annually. United keeps improving. 3 years ago very sloppy with delays and cancellations. Additionally the plances were old. They have become very timely, the staff are couteous and the equipment is on the newer side.    A zebra can change its stripes."
Mar 2020,50,Flight to Hawaii from YYZ,"After some screw ups by their booking department, I contacted their head office in Chicago and everything was made right. A fantastic customer service department (Ginger) who looked after our concerns and then some in celebrating our sons 20th wedding anniversary."
Mar 2020,40,I've heard a lot of bad press bud I had no problem - good service,"August 2019 Dublin - Newark, Newark to Denver, Denver to Albuqueque, Las Vegas - New York, New York to Dublin. All on time good service ok food. Only thing that annoyed me was the attitude of an air hostess who made me go back to my seat when I had gone to lie down on a row of three empty seats on the Denver to Albuqueque flight (I had been on the go since Dublin and the plane was approx 40% full so really didnt think it was a problem) just thought her attitude was more abrupt than it needed to be."
Mar 2020,40,Fly United,"Flying the cheapest saves, however, expect occasional delays in Chicago! People were generally polite!"
Mar 2020,10,Terrible airline,"Flying to Idaho Falls from Buffalo via Chicago & Denver February 2020 and from Idaho Falls to Buffalo via Denver & Newark March 2020. 7 flights over 12 days and ALL significantly delayed by 1-4 hours and none of the employees seemed the least bit concerned! Told at each stop that ""we are running a bit late"". 10-15 mins is ""a bit late"" imho, NOT hours and hours. Then adding insult to injury part way during the delay you would receive a text telling you the gate had been changed. Worst airline I've ever had the misfortune to fly with and have been around the world over the years and flown with many, many airlines. Would NOT recommend anyone fly United if there is a different choice available."
Mar 2020,40,On time and good service,We left on time and arrived early. The crew was communicative and kept us informed of potential rough weather and flight status. Seats were assigned at the gate and we sat together and had bulkhead seats.
Mar 2020,50,Excellent,"Great flights and all on time , actually early! Very smooth flight, tv’s worked great and the flight attendants were very friendly."
Mar 2020,10,Don't waste your money,We have tried numerous times to give United another chance on the flight and every time our flight gets canceled our flights are delayed they damage our strollers they refused to remember Sus for anything and the last time when they re booked our flight they booked it for the next month 6 to Alaska Airlines United can't get their krapp together
Mar 2020,50,Exceptional customer service!,"The ground hostess at the airport was simply fantastic! She was a role model employee with Midas touch. She made me feel valued, and provided a tailor made service for which I’m ever grateful of proud. United Airlines ticked all the boxes of world class including in flight choice of entertainment, offer of cuisines from all over the world including a vast array of drinks to feast on throughout the 11/12hrs flight. It was a fabulous experience!!!    Thanks to United Airline!!"
Mar 2020,50,Great economy flight,"Pleasantly surprised by the economy seats and service on this flight. I've not flown with United before so wasn't sure what to expect, but the seats were spacious with good leg room. The in flight entertainment had plenty of choice, the meals were very good, the staff were friendly and very helpful."
Mar 2020,10,HORRIBLE,"Horrible food, stewardess who clearly dont want to be there. Worst part is my bag was popped open from all the tossing it endured. Then taped up with box tape destroying the color. I go through 2 terminals to finally get to baggage specialist that tell me i shouldnt have put a tsa approved lock on my bag because its illegal and its tsa fault not united, so she puts in a claim for some guy to pick my bag up and fix my zipper. You cant charge me 120 dollars to check in my bag both ways and then destroy a 200 dollar luggage and tell me its not their fault and they wont do anything for me. I didnt get any sort of deal honestly ive paid the same price on other airlines for this type of flight and way better seats. The pricing on the seats was ridiculously high. Save your aggravations and fly else where."
Mar 2020,40,All was good,Had early boarding (group 2) so got settled in our seats early. Lucky for us our middle seat passenger never showed so we had plenty of room.
Mar 2020,20,Worst International Flight Yet,"Basic back-of-the-plane trip, cramped, loud, annoying. Nothing different here from any other airline (with one or two exceptions). I don't expect much and don't complain when I don't receive much but this cabin crew needs retraining. A child, probably about 2 or 3 years old, ran continuously up and down the narrow aisle for more than six hours. Give the kid credit for stamina and ask what mom was doing during his trips (reading mostly), but this continued even though the seat-belt sign was on. The kid's face was just at armrest height and one lurch of the aircraft and we're looking at blood, crying, a possible emergency landing, and a whopping great lawsuit. I have seen bored cabin crews, but when safety is concerned they need to be on top of it at all times."
Mar 2020,30,Unhappy Crew,"So after a pleasant check-in and an orderly, timely boarding, I was a little displeased that the First Class cabin crew just seemed so unhappy. They never smiled, spoke in muted tones and seemed indifferent when I tried to get past them. Also the leg room seemed smaller and the restroom was a closet. I am not a big person and I felt claustrophobic in both spaces. The breakfast options were also lacking. Considering the amount they charge they could and should have done much better. Now the entertainment options were fabulous and the on plane WiFi was reliable. A so-so flight and I know United can do so much better."
Mar 2020,20,"Improving, but still claustraphobic anywhere but premium seats","I quit flying United a long time ago, but recently have been forced to take a few flights due to business travel schedule. On the plus side, United is better than when I quit using them. Staff is generally friendly now, and they actually provide free soft drinks again.    However, the seating is even more claustraphobic than I remember anywhere other than premium seating. Add to that the seats have very thin padding (maybe so they could get the seats even closer together?) In-flight entertainment worked on my cell phone, but could not be accessed from my windows computer -- so I was stuck with a tiny window (didn't even bother except on one flight).    All in all, I still will be stearing clear of United as much as possible.    *As an added note, seat spacing is acceptable on their small, old planes that fly to tiny airports like Vernal, UT."
Mar 2020,30,"Pleasantly surprised, until the food arrived.","Whenever asked I used to tell people that United was about the worst airline I had ever experienced, so I was not looking forward to this trip. On boarding the plane I was surprised that the seat, although small was comfortable, the area clean and well lit, lots of luggage space in the bin, the United staff were efficient, friendly and, to my great surprise very courteous and helpful. The plane was not new but it was a long way from my last United experience when the plane was a dilapidated mess. All in all not bad, I have flown on much, much worse...then the food arrived, and it was wretched. Oh well, a much better airline but still no cigar."
Mar 2020,10,Cancelled flight without notification,"United cancelled my flight supposed to leave at 11:50 am and moved me to a flight at 7:34 am and DID NOT NOTIFY ME at any point about the change so I only found out the night before when i went to double check my ticket. When I called they did nothing to help or compensate me. United also scams customers booking basic economy by making it very unclear that you do not get any carry on bag on your flight which then forces you to pay $30 each way to check a bag. Horrible airline, had to call customer service 3 times about this reservation, not helpful and legitimately appears to scam customers."
Mar 2020,50,Captain’s Thank you Note a Nice Touch,What impressed me most was the nice card that the first class passengers were given by the plane’s captain. A very nice touch. Enjoyable trip  all around.
Mar 2020,10,How can a plane this cramped be safe?,"United has gone downhill! I could not get over how small the seats were on this plane. I've never seen such limited leg room and seat space and I fly fairly often. I am 5'5, size medium, and was scrunched. Thank God the person in front of me did not recline their seat. The poor guy next to me was 5'9"" and average build. He was spilling over into my seat area and it could not be helped. This was by far the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on and I will go out of my way now to not book through United. I read an article recently that their CEO even agrees that their seats are too small, but there are no plans to make any changes. This cannot be safe for passengers. You can do better, United. Until then, I will seek out your competition."
Mar 2020,30,"Boring, no entertainment","The day before the flight we got an email telling us to download the app so we would have in flight entertainment. We all did, and then we boarded this 8 hour flight only to find out they really weren’t kidding about the entertainment!!! There was only a clip on the seat back to hold whatever device you brought with you! This was a return flight for us (we flew there on American, with entertainment) so we realized our family of 4 had to share chargers as our devices ran out. Also, best laid plans...the phones wouldn’t stay in the clip, only the iPads. Oh, but that didn’t matter because there was a problem with the WiFi anyway!! Some people had movies streaming and others just had a spinning hourglass forever! The flight attendants even made an announcement about how to access the WiFi if it was just spinning but many never worked. I have to and watched a show I downloaded until I feel asleep. My kids played a game and annoyed people I’m sure. It was really annoying! Also, compared to American, the sandwiches were not as good. I actually usually prefer United, but for a long haul flight I wouldn’t choose them again."
Mar 2020,10,Change Fees are higher than actual ticket price,"We had to cancel our flight to Toronto due to the train strike. United gave us a credit for the trip of $412 but when I went to book a trip to Florida and use the credit voucher, my rate was higher than if I booked it straight out w/o the credit! Fees were $300 on a $408 trip (if I booked w/o credit, it came out to $408) When applying the credit, I had to book in a higher category, and even after deducting the credit and adding the fee, it came out to $437! ($549-412+300=$437)!! It's like I don't have a credit at all...in fact, I pay extra for having a $412 credit...ridiculous"
Mar 2020,40,Great flight!,"I was expecting an average flight on United from Washington Dulles to London UK but was pleasantly surprised. The plane itself was quite modern with wonderful IFE. So many movies that I didn't have time to watch! My touchscreen did have some issues when I wanted to rewind or forward scenes. The crew were all friendly considerate and really courteous. The flight was probably less than half full. A lot of people had entire rows to themselves, probably due to reduced travel because of the coronavirus. I managed to rest on the flight. The food was tasty and they even served yummy vanilla bean icecream. Despite the turbulance, the pilot got us to London on time and luggage was promptly available after immigration. Well done United! I am looking forward to having the same experience on other United flights."
Mar 2020,40,Room for everyone!,"Flight was about 1/3 full, so lots of room to stretch out, for everyone. Flight staff was relaxed and at ease, absolutely no problems. However, bring your own dinner unless you want to buy whatever they have on board, and there is no movie or TV shows available for this flight."
Mar 2020,30,I continue to be disappointed.....,"Today’s peeve... every time you put your elbow on the arm rest, you end up changing the channel of the entertainment system. Also, poor choices as to what to watch compared to the great Delta entertainment system.    I avoid United if I can.    I do have to say this was the cleanest United equipment (airplane) that I have flown on. It was a B737-800."
Mar 2020,40,ontime and slick,"Everyone seems to be jumping on United but our last flight was smooth, very easy. We got seats with extra leg room which was a huge benefit. Boarding was not the usual cattle round-up but orderly. Bags popped out quickly so we were through the airport quickly at each end of our flight. good job, United!"
Mar 2020,30,On time - $86 tickets from Cancun to Chicago- can't go wrong,"The flight was ok on time and attendants were. But for that price, I can't complain about anything. As an explorer member, I get 1st. check bag free which is great and big money saver. Direct TV entertainment was not fun."
Mar 2020,50,Great flight. Great service.,"This was our first time flying with United and we were impressed with their service. They were on time and with their luggage tracker, which honestly I have no idea why every airline doesn’t have this, is the best thing about this airline. We have all of our dive gear in our checked bag and we could track it on and off the planes so the peace of mind was worth the price of the ticket. The flight staff were gracious and attentive and the seats... well they are airline seats not lazy-boys so there isn’t much to say about that. Would we fly with them again... absolutely."
Mar 2020,50,Austin TX trip,"Flights were on time, efficient and friendly attendants, comfortable seating, overall pleasant experience."
Mar 2020,50,Great airline,Really nice people! Nice service! Food was good. Uneventful which is what I like on long flights! Thanks United!
Mar 2020,50,"""Top of the Line"" Service","Organized, efficient, comfortable with extra emphasis on great customer service from the boarding procedure to touch down."
Mar 2020,30,Not the Best,"Truly not the best of air travel. I do not like being nickeled and dimed for every step I take. I find the customer service to be barely tolerable and at a minimum. You would think that at least there would be a way to turn off the very bright screens on the back of the seats during a late-night flight; but no, just advertisements.."
Mar 2020,10,horrible worst airline ever,delayed 7 hours changed gates 3 times before we actually got the right flight and correct gate worst experience ever they need to get organized and get thieir crap together never fly with them ahain I will walk first !!!!
Mar 2020,50,Short but comfortable flight,"It was only a short flight in one of their small airplanes. But the flight was smooth and relatively comfortable. The check-in service was great, the ladies at the counter were super helpful!"
Mar 2020,50,Happily Ever After...,"The ticket I purchased did not include a checked bag or carry on, just a personal bag. It also didn't allow me to pick my seat and I was placed in btwn two other passengers. Because I didn't choose to check in a bag, I could not complete the check in online, and needed to go to the counter to get my personal bag checked to make sure it met the dimensional requirements. I tried to get my seat changed multiple times but was not able to. I asked the attendant at the door when I was boarding if there was any possibility because of where I was seated. I explained I had a partial amputation on my foot, and my medication made me have to go to the restroom often, that it would be easier. She told me she would check if there was anything she could do. I thanked her and made my way down the aisle. About a third of the way down, the other attendant came to tell me there was another seat available, but it was all the way to the back of the plane. I told her I didn't mind and I was able to get an aisle seat, with the other two seats empty. Another attendant was so kind and sweet when she accepted money for the box snacks they have available. I didn't have a card on me to pay but wanted one. She and the fourth attendant, the only male, worked beautifully together, mindful of what was going on, new what was needed and assisted each other. They were all friendly and attentive. In the beginning, I was upset about the bag policy and not allowing a regular sized carry on. I had to squish clothes, make up, toiketries, and footwear in an overnighter bag. And since that was my personal bag allowed, I also stuffed my purse in it. The flight attendants were absolute DOLLS and made it possible for me to live, happily, ever after!!!"
Mar 2020,30,Turbulence,The flight was alright little bit of turbulence and I know it’s was a smooth ride until at the end too much fun
Mar 2020,50,The most helpful Airline i have experienced,"I have flown with a few different airlines but my experience with United Airlines recently is well worth reviewing. The staff at LaGuardia (NYC) Airport (Linda) were so helpful with our delayed flight to Houston which affected our connecting flight to Sydney Australia, i will be forever grateful. Linda reorganised out flights and placed us in a car to be driven to Newark Airport on the other side of NYC to ensure we got a flight to Sydney. At every point of our flight we were kept up to date and were reassured on flight times and gate departures. The Pilot even requested over the loud speaker that passengers with connecting flights to disembark first to ensure they arrived to their gate in time. I couldn't thank the staff enough. It made our flight less stressful. Thank you United Airlines, i will definitely fly with you again."
Mar 2020,10,Medical Emergency,I called to refund my flight because I was having a medical emergency. They would not refund my flight! They said it’s only good for a year but have no vacation days left so I would have to go 2021. They are awful especially since I’m having a medical emergency! They need to change this policy or be able to transfer the flight into someone elses name. Horrible Service!!!
Mar 2020,40,Best option for a IAD-SAN fight!!,"We have flown the Dulles-San Diego route several times over the past many years and, unless I'm missing something, United currently offers the only non-stop flights on this route. We much prefer non-stop flights and find the United IAD-SAN flights the only option. Combing this preference and accumulating United points, we think there is no other option!"
Mar 2020,40,Uneventful trip which is a good thing,Basically no delays and not a full flight so we were able to stretch out for the 10 hour flight. Food was mediocre at best but they kept the wine pouring if you so desired free of charge. Best thing about the meal was the ice cream.
Mar 2020,10,They do not stand behind they work. If they make a mistake it is blamed on the customer.,They do not stand behind they work. If they make a mistake it is blamed on the customer.  Use any other airline if at all possible unless you just want to headache or just be disappointed and feel like a big corporation that ask you to trust it is untrustworthy.
Mar 2020,10,"Consumer Advocacy Wins; Pays For Never On-Board United Again ,","Departure:  - Aircraft maintenance failure = 1st delay.  - Flight personnel failure to show = 2nd delay.  - Due to airline's total failure to honor their contracted services, we invoked traveler's rights that require them to book us on a different flight on a different airline in order to make our connection in FL.  - Cost us 1/2 of vacation day 1.  - Traveler's insurance contacted; claim initiated.  - UA provided $12 food vouchers that had been misprinted, indicating they were expired, and thus worthless.  - UA at total fault, apathetic.  - No real-time accountability.  - Fundamentally broken response procedures.    Return:  - Weather caused multi-day delays across Eastern seaboard.  - Higher than average in-bound phone traffic completely forseeable, predicatable; terrible UA / Travelocity management procedures made matter worse, not better.  - UA & Travelocity comlpletely overwhelmed on account of inadequate staffing to meet the in-bound call needs of their known stranded travelers.  - 4+ hour hold times, only to be disconnected.  - No same-langauge representatives could be reached in a reasonable time-frame.  - Finally rebooked after gruelling, maddening 30-hour call-hold-disconnect cycles.  - These cascading failures required us to pay for 4 extra nights/resort fees.  - Aircraft maintenance failure caused 1st out-bound delay.  - Airport snafu caused redirection to alternate airport; missed connection; 4-hour delay.  - UA logistical failure caused mislabeled and/or temporarily lost luggage.  - Zero real-time accountability.  - Apathetic, poorly trained UA personnel.    After 5 months of negotiating credits and refunds with UA exec. services, trip insurance provider, credit card co. & Travelocity, we were fully reimbursed the costs of our vacation, airfare, and awarded travel vouchers, which were actually honored and transferrable.    Be a thorn in the sides of their corporate executive services deptartment until you reach a representative with a heart, a soul, some managerial discretion and the sense to admit they were systematically broken, and organizationally wrong from the start. Still never flying United Airlines or booking with Travelocity again, but strongly recommend travel insurance.    These days, if you don't self-advocate, ""customer service"" is, insufferably, neither."
Mar 2020,30,St Martin 2020,The outbound flight was OK. I had two small children sitting beside me and they were OK. The return flight had a more caring inspired flight crew and we arrived back in the US 40 minutes early. Customs and Immigrations were not the friendliest upon arrival home. Can’t wait for a lawsuit over someone banging on the back of a seat that another passenger has paid extra money. United sent me a credit for a previous flight and when I applied it to this trip airfare they didn’t accept the credit.
Mar 2020,30,Very uncomfortable flight. Could not sit with my legs together in row 35 (aft most row).,"I felt like a sardine in a can the entire trip west bound. I do not recommend basic economy unless you are a midget traveling with nothing more than the clothes on your back. No overhead storage allowed. Last row, no recline either. When the pax in the seat in front of you reclines his/her seat you can barely breath."
Mar 2020,50,"Great Service, Great Flight!!","Once again United did phenomenal job start to finish! The booking process was a breeze. All the staff both onboard and off were professional and helpful. The flight itself was ahead of schedule both ways. We opted for the extra legroom, it’s well worth the extra money."
Mar 2020,40,Flight was good,"The flight was good. Flight attendants did a great job. The flight was cloudy most of the trip and bumpy at spots but I felt comfortable the entire way. I was stuck in the middle in the very last row, so that's not the best spot to be but I survived."
Mar 2020,20,Not my airline preference,"We decided to fly United because of the lower ticket price. Not really sure if that was a great idea. The saying, “you get what you pay for” really rings true. Everything about this airline is mediocre. The snacks, stale pretzels, the drinks are usually the same, but in this case there was no hot water. And the seats........time to do a little cosmetic upgrades."
Mar 2020,50,Easy Flight,It was a quick and pleasant non stop flight to Key West. We did take off a little late but we were leaving from a snowstorm when most of the flights had been cancelled. Our friends booked early and paid A LOT more than we had to. We booked about 4 months in advance.
Mar 2020,40,efficient boarding and good service,"i flew from sea to med on united and then avianca between bogota and medellin. the flights mostly  left on time with the exception of a hiccup in houston where they had to wait on a crew member from another flt.  the crew was friendly and accommodating but as with most flights nowadays, even international ones, there’s such limited space for baggage in the overhead bins that if you don’t board first you’re either having to check your bag last minute at the gate or cram it into an overhead bin aisles  away from where you’re seated.  if you buy premium economy seats there are dedicated bins for those individuals but it’s still a harrowing experience if you’re like me and travel light without checked baggage.  on the flight down, there was a dinner option that didn’t have meat but on my return flight to the us, it was only chicken or beef so i was out of luck because id either forgotten to request a special meal  or it wasn’t available to do so on that specific flight.  short story is:  board as quickly as they call your group, stow your bag even quicker and bring your own food if you don’t want to take your chances with whatever the airline is serving.  i DO love united’s biscoff biscuits :)"
Mar 2020,10,No service attitude at all,"Although I paid as many bonus miles as business class requires for this 14 hour flight - they only let me in economy and said business class was full. On the plane I realized 60 % of business class empty. They would not let me change seats on the plane. - UNfriendly, they just do not care!"
Mar 2020,50,Thanks for your real concern.,Thanks Customer Service for your immediate response and real concern in our complain. Glad to flight with you.
Mar 2020,10,Torched most of my trip to Kenya,"This is a negative review. The economy seating is so tight and seating uncomfortable that the only way I could attempt to sleep on a mid-Atlantic leg of this trip was contorting my neck and back over the fold-down tray. Which led to a pinched radial nerve. Which resulted in a paralyzed hand. Which buggered a bunch of the trip.  This is as much to with Airbus (screw Airbus, and the safety videos they show are a joke! How does one assume crash position when one's face is a foot from the seat in front?!) as it does with United, cramming as many head of cattle in to the space as they can, but United bought the planes so they could cram as many head of cattle into the plane.  I voiced my frustration, in an even toned email, asking for a refund of the ticket and $600 deposit I lost because of the paralysis. Their policy is no refunds, though they offer a credit. i suppose the refund policy is understandable but....paralysis...  United can piss off."
Mar 2020,10,Coronavirus,"To whom it may concern,    We recently booked a trip to Seattle from Mexico City with dates of Feb 12th to 19th (originally I had booked for a different date and changed it for personal reasons, and I paid the change). With the coronavirus updates, we decided that our top priority is our safety. We reached out to the United office in Mexico City to explore if this was possible, and they mentioned that it was but we had to pay another fee yet again.    I genuinely do not think it is fair nor in the best interest of social well-being to force folks to fly towards a destination that is the infection for the US, while exposing passengers to the most dangerous part of the trip which is your own airplanes. In other words, when we needed to change the flight due to personal reasons we paid what was required, but when we want to change the flight because the service you provide - the flight - exposes us to a deadly virus, I do not think it is fair for us to pay a penalty again. We are not looking for a refund, we are simply asking for the option of moving the flight to a later date once the risk reduces.    Please let me know who is the best contact to communicate my discomfort and concern to find a resolution that keeps us engaged with your airline for the future, while minimize infection risk for the whole society."
Mar 2020,30,Smooth Flight,"Last minute purchase the ticket through cheaptickets (SG). The transaction was fast and smoothly.    Check in was smooth if you have all required documents ready (ESTA receipt).    Boarding of plane was based on grouping and is smooth. The food served were not bad. Flight attendants are very attentive and service was fast when requesting for assistance.    Legroom is pretty much limited.    Toilet looks a little run down and poorly maintained. The trash bins were not cleared through the long flight and as a results, some tissues were being thrown on the floor.    Overall flight was great and smooth."
Mar 2020,10,Do not use united airlines,Basic economy only lets you have 1 bag!! You don’t get to take a purse and a little free personal item carryon - not worth it!!!!! Never will I ever use United!!!!!!!
Mar 2020,50,Direct flight to Tel Aviv,"Excellent Service, as always, smooth travels to Tel Aviv. This route provides a comfortable 10 hr travel, arriving the next day in the afternoon. I was able to rest well and relax."
Mar 2020,40,"Suspect it’s because of Boeing, but this plane was not up to speed","We had no wifi, no entertainment screens, no lie flat seats. To those who would say, spoiled much? it is why you pay the big price. Also, dinner was very disappointing. Generally like United. Not this flight. Also allowed an extremely sick infant on board. Not happy w that considering the covid19 issues."
Mar 2020,40,"Could have been excellent, but...","Many reviews said the united app for entertainment was sub-par. I could not get it to work on an android phone. Frustrating. The flight was fine and the service was great, but most airlines have entertainment on flights over 2 hours."
Mar 2020,40,"O time departure, early arrival.",Good flight. Seats were reasonably comfortable. Service was good. Short layover in flight from San Antonio but bags made it so all was ok.
Mar 2020,50,GREAT SERVICE,"personnel, service, routing, ontime factor, all FANTASTIC!! Aircraft was clean, LAVS were clean and stocked with nice amenities"
Mar 2020,40,Care & Comfort,"The flight that was about 10 hours was smooth going with few bumps. Although the seat cushions are not very comfortable, our flight was at 3pm so plenty of sleep time and flight was not full. We were provided dinner and snacks/beverages and all was quite delicious. Very much appreciated offer of ear phones and entertainment/wi-fi and ability to charge my devices. The flight crew was caring and efficient, made the flight more enjoyable. I needed wheelchair assistance and that was taken care of and greatly appreciated."
Mar 2020,40,Nice Flight,"We enjoyed our flight. We thought we would not make it because they had computer programs but once we got checked in, she told us to hurry. We showed security our boarding time and she let us cut through the queue. We made it to our plane with 5 minutes to spare. We will now have more empathy for travelers running in the terminals and trying to rush through security - it is probably not the travelers' fault.    The flight attendants were friendly. The meals were fair and kept us full. Legroom was not a lot but we knew what we should expect. In summary, we were happy with our flight."
Mar 2020,10,Do not buy basic economy,"This class of service is better referred to as a fools choice. You cannot PAY for an upgraded seat. Reservation was made for me so I had no choice but I find this to be an ignorant plan on the part of the greedy management of United Airlines. No matter what class of service they offer. I will not fly on this lousy airline again. Flight delay too because the auto pilot is not working. What?? I suppose that is a basic economy issue too. After paying for bags $30. United, here this, you have lost a customer."
Mar 2020,40,Polaris Class spolled me,Being upgraded to Polaris on y return home has spoiled me - what a terrific class of service - compared to Economy plus - because of the food service - and seat comfort. Very grateful - as I was getting very tired of the same food options offered over and over in the rear of the plane. Nice to know United can do a better job when motivated to attract business customers. Prayers abound for another upgrade!
Mar 2020,40,Everything went as expected.,"The minimum I hope for in a flight is for it to be uneventful. That sums up this flight. The plane was fairly new and some seats had electrical outlets. The service was what it should be and it took off and landed on time. We made it to the luggage carousel in good time and grabbed my wife's suitcase before it went around again. Mine had not made the carousel yet. Oh yeah, this is Newark! It didn't make it for another hour and they finally put the rest of the luggage on a different carousel and waited a while to let us know. Thankfully our ride home was patient and we got out of there. It is what it is."
Mar 2020,20,Leg room very limited and no TV,"Recently flew round trip from Newark, NJ to Tampa, FL for a four day getaway. Would not recommend flying United Airlines and will definitely not select them again. The leg room was ridiculous. I felt like the passengers seat in front of me was in my face the entire trip and the seat wasn't reclined. United jams in as many seats as they can. There was no tv in the seat back and we were advised to download the United app on our phones to view entertainment. The only positive of the flights were that they took off and landed on-time."
Mar 2020,10,Upgrade ha ha,"I find it hilarious that as a high level United flier the promises of upgrades are pretty much made to nearly half the passengers on a given flight. I was fine with no upgrade, but less than 24 hours prior to our flight they separated my daughter and I so we were not sitting together. They claimed that there was a change in aircraft which was untrue. To make things worse they gave my daughters seat and the empty seat between us to another mother/daughter. Don't say you get upgrades when you don't and never separate passengers who have paid fulll fare for their seats unless there is a really good reason that involves the safety and welfare of all passengers."
Mar 2020,40,Always a great experience,"Love non stop...take this same flight always to visit my granddaughter in Houston. Use same with my pet, and have always had an easy time. Wish times were better."
Mar 2020,10,Emergency seat aisles,It use to be that the airline asked for volunteers to sit in emergency seats if you had to open the emergency door. Now they want you to pay to sit in these aisles. If you don’t pay for these seats and no one is sitting in those seats... who’s going to open those emergency doors??
Mar 2020,40,Surprisingly comfy!,Friendly staff. Comfortable seats. Excellent entertainment selection. On time. Very long flight but overall good experience and recommend this route.
Mar 2020,40,Good flght in général.,"Nice flight between México and Washington, flight crew very gentleand helpful.  I would definitely fly again with them."
Mar 2020,20,Never again!,"Our first leg, from Vegas to O'hare, great exit aisle seats. Lots of legroom. But, a three hour flight and no movie? Not good. O'hare to Cleveland? Last row. Spirit seating and no leg room...at United prices. Never again. Movie offered but couldn't finish."
Mar 2020,10,Budget Economy - Expensive Third Class Treatment - TripAdvisor Non-Disclosed Ripoff,"Baggage charges made my seats more expensive than economy. Must check bags! I felt like I was back in the 1920's. Last to board, back of the plane seating, no carry-on baggage, no changes and no exceptions. United should eliminate these fares completely.    TripAdvisor shouldn't even advertise these seats without notifying us that they are a ripoff unless you are Jack Reacher and travel with only a toothbrush. This is the last time I use TripAdvisor for anything."
Mar 2020,30,Disappointing,Customer service is non-existent. Leg room is limited. On flight service is basic.  Boarding is ridiculous based on fare not by seat.
Mar 2020,30,Two and a half hours with the seatbelt sign on! No turbulence at all,It seemed to be that the seatbelt sign was on for the convenience of the cabin crew. There was no turbulence but the passengers were confined to their seats for a third of the flight. The service was at best adequate. I won’t be hurrying back to United
Mar 2020,20,Expected much more from world class airlines.,"Purchasing ticket from Vegas to Denver from United and return ticket from Frontier, for sure were much worried regarding return flight, than about departure from Vegas.    Mccaran airport itself offers quite friendly staff and good experience, but within my entire life and quite big flight experience i have never seen Airbus A321 with such a poor interior. Quality of seats were close to 0, extremely narrow and stiff seats, with very-very tight legroom.  Staff during the flight was quite unnoticeable, not bad, not good."
Mar 2020,20,On Time,"Overall, they are average. They make no attempt to be better or make you feel like they care about you. Their planes are nice. Their flight attendants are average. Some are nice and some really don't want to be there. I ordered a Kosher meal and it was on my ticket and it was not on the plane and they could not care at all. Also, this is the first international flight that I was charged for alcohol. Every other airline gives free alcohol on international flights. They are also not considerate when placing people. We had two seats with the middle seat empty and many seats around us with two seats empty. The counter agent put a person between us instead of putting him in one of the two seat empty seats on an eight hours flight ahead of us. This airline could learn to appreciate their customers more."
Mar 2020,40,Very comfortable,"Very good flight, super comfortable with loads of room to enjoy a sleep. We were on the 9am flight and were served breakfast and straight after, lunch. Even though breakfast wouldn't have been necessary, all the food that was served on board was tasty.  The staff were very friendly and made us feel very welcome"
Feb 2020,10,Very bad experience,"The first leg is from Maui to Sam Francisco. We sat on the ground for an hour due to some delay at security so people who didn’t get to the airport in time were majorly delayed. I understand the airline doesn’t want to lose money but at some point, it is not reasonable to punish people who actually behaved.    The 2nd leg is to Toronto. We paid so that we can sit together but due to plane swap, our seats got reassigned to two different spots. We first tried customer service, the agent didn’t give a damn. She insisted there were empty seats beside my husband’s but she cannot change it and sent us away to the gate. Then the agent at the gate refused to release the seat and insisted the plane is full - so two versions of seating situation already. He said he would call us back which is completely a lie as we just sat beside the counter and he was doing jack (beep) to resolve our issue.    Overall, the intentional delay at Maui and the cold / unhelpful agents made it a very bad experience."
Feb 2020,50,Family Time,My son and his wife had their first baby and I was able to fly on United for a great deal! The flights were all good and I was so happy with the experience!
Feb 2020,50,Excellent Customer Service,There is a short connection time between ORD and LAN. The plane arrived at Terminal C and the connecting flight was departing from Terminal E. I mentioned my concern regarding the short connection time to a Customer Service Rep at ORD prior to boarding my flight to AZ. She arranged to have personnel meet me upon my arrival in ORD who quickly took me to my gate.
Feb 2020,10,DO NOT FLY UNITED,"Would have rather paid an extra $100 for American Airlines or even get in the car and drive. Both my flight there and back we delayed (total of 4 hours wasted sitting in airport) they pack you in like a sardine (just as bad as spirit) and no online check in for flyers not checking bags (basic economy) it seems their strategy is to make the customer as miserable as possible just so they will pay for upgrade. UNITED IS THE WORST, you will be delayed and you will be unhappy."
Feb 2020,10,"Junky, Expensive, Treated poorly","The flight is always filthy and, fir what it cost, you would think it would be a little nicer or at least not have to pay 25$ for a checked bag that they FORCE you to check when all other airlines let you put it overhead. The also have ridiculous restrictions on carry-on size and dint even offer you food or drink on a 5 hour flight. I am never flying United again."
Feb 2020,40,Good flight,"We took a late night flight from Rio, Brazil to Houston, TX non-stop. This was the only non-stop flight from Rio I could find for our dates and time of travel. We flew in economy with bulkhead seats. GIG is a very large airport. We used the Priority pass lounge while waiting for 2 hours before boarding. The boarding process was very orderly and we got on quickly. It was a good flight with dinner and breakfast snack served. Flight was 10 hours. Arriving in Houston (IAH) at 6am meant short immigration lines."
Feb 2020,50,On time,"Easy check-in. Flight was on time. Seats are very narrow, but premium-economy has plenty of leg room. Arrived at destination early and baggage arrived quickly."
Feb 2020,30,Business Class,"Number one....there was no screen on the back of the seat to watch movies/tv. The food offering was ""beef brisket"" because they were out of the ravioli. I was the 4th row back out of 6. I really don't get it!!!!! This was business class."
Feb 2020,20,It was ok,"The flight down was fine. The flight home was a nightmare. The Flight Attendant didn't show up until 1-1/2 past take off. This made us late for our flight in Chicago. My husband has a knee problem, and there was no one to help get us to our next concourse. They did hold the plane, but we had to practically run to get to our flight, and that's not easy in Chicago."
Feb 2020,50,United airlines,Experience was good. Customer service was good. Workers helpful and friendly. There were no delays and that is great for a last flight of the day. IN fact we landed early.
Feb 2020,30,"Ontime flight, Entertainment equipment non-fuctional",Our flight left on time and landed on time. what my comments are about is that my seat had a non-functioning entertainment equipment. the armrest buttons did not work and the seat back screen didn't work. I used by iPad to connect to the movie but the earphones that the flight attendant handed out didn't fully work.
Feb 2020,30,Business class has no perks,We didn't get a drink before take off and the snacks (no meals) were pretty slim. You need to provide your own entertainment since there is no screen on back of seats. Otherwise it went smoothly and seemed a short flight.
Feb 2020,40,Good experience. Travel to South America for the first time,We traveled from Nashville to Lima with our entire family (2 adults and 3 kids). It was our longest international trip so far and it went smoothly.
Feb 2020,20,Customer service is a null,"As frequent flyers we decided to try this airline. We flew from Edinburgh to Auckland and they lost all the wheels on our suitcase. We bought a new suitcase and filed a claim yet haven't heard back. We just returned from Auckland to Edinburgh we missed our flights in San Fran due to customs. We got next flight but even though we asked to make sure they had put our 5 year old son no where near us on the plane. As we were sat at back of plane they ran out of food and only had a chickpea curry to offer myself, my 5 year old son and my husband. My 5 year old doesn't eat curry and I have IBS so refrain from eating it. We were starving and arrived in Edinburgh 2 days ago. They had lost all our luggage we had to go and all buy coats for the way home and they have not so much as even phoned to let us know what is going on with our luggage. I face booked them and they weren't much help either..."
Feb 2020,10,Worst flight experience ever!!!,"Booked a trip to Florida and back. Me and my wife and two esa dog's. We took JetBlue there and United back. I called more than a month in advance to make sure I received the bulk head seats to fit comfortable since my dog is an Australian shepherd and weighs around 60 pds. JetBlue was great, paid a bit more but wonderful experience. United also guaranteed me two bulk head seats but no charge so I thought great. Then I called united again 5 hrs before the flight to make sure all was good and again was guaranteed bulk head seats. But when we arrived at the flight not only did we not have bulk head seats but we were sat separately and me in the very last row next to two strangers who were not happy being next to a dog. It was the worst flight I have ever had. Squeezing into a seat with a 65 pd dog on top of me holding him the whole flight. United stole my money because I would have never flown with them had they not guaranteed my seats!!!!!"
Feb 2020,30,"Great staff, lousy plane","I fly united often, as they are the main option here in NJ. Newark despite the recent upgrades is still horrible, with long check in lines for everything ( even with Clear) and getting through security took forever.  A direct flight to Antigua though, huge bonus (even if it does leave at peak time in the morning, no idea who scheduled that one, but I'll take the extra beach time)  The gate staff, and plane staff were great, they pre board families again now, so traveling with young kids is a lot easier. What was not good, was the lack of screens / entertainment on the flight. Everything was on personal device using the inflight United app, and it was spotty, and crappy. We had iPads for the kids but the service kept just stalling, leading to hugely frustrated kiddos. The upside was they read their books and colored instead, but still, it's a useless service!  Once on the ground in Antigua - the airport is fantastic!"
Feb 2020,10,Worst customer service,"United fails in all aspects of customer service. They make it clear that their interest in making money with all the additional charges for luggage, and seats. Such a bad experience. Even hearing the delight attendant sigh and say ""I'm not ready to serve people"" before boarding the plane."
Feb 2020,40,Upgrading to extra legroom was worth it.,"Flight was fine but no entertainment of any kind was offered. We reached our destination a bit early but due to a storm and zero visibility were unable to land. Not having enough fuel to circle until the storm had passed we flew to a nearby airport, refueled, and returned to our original destination several hours later."
Feb 2020,20,No Entertainment on International Flight,I flew from Boston to Newark which is a 1 hour flight and had monitors for entertainment purposes but the 6 hour leg from Newark to Aruba had none. Pretty unbelievable! I didn't know these type of aircrafts still existed. There was a young girl next to me who did not have wifi or any other entertainment and bothered me majority of the flight.
Feb 2020,40,Old plane but good service,The staff was very professional and prompt . The only complaint I have is the old planes used by United for domestic travels .
Feb 2020,50,"Confortable, good service.","United provide us excellent service during our return home after our vacation in Barcelona. Always on time, the food was good, the airplane was amazing. In general we enjoy our vacations flying with United and it partner Lufthansa. We recommend United Airlines."
Feb 2020,10,Another reason United is terrible,"Got to Sarasota airport at 7:30 am for a flight that boards at 9:05 am only to find a dozen people waiting for United staff to show up. Turns out they don’t open the counter till 8 am so no one is able to check bags, deal with tickets etc. Really???? Aren’t airlines always encouraging us to get to airport early. A disgrace!"
Feb 2020,30,overall not too bad :-),"The flight experience itself was not too bad; flight attendants was nice and friendly. Flight was delayed 4 hrs and an half for a technical problem; we were kept on the plane with not much info on the ongoing situation, so quite disappointing."
Feb 2020,20,Avoid if possible,"Rude staff, more expensive, and you basically can't take a carry on unless you are in the first 2 (of 5) boarding groups. 4 straight times now I have to wait at baggage claim for a small carry on bag. Meanwhile they make billions in profit."
Feb 2020,40,Early flight to San Francisco,Good flight but getting to airport at 3:30 am to make it through US customs is tight. Very tiring but no choice since there was still a connection. Entertainment system was good.
Feb 2020,40,"Good airline, but cares less about loyalty than it used to","Overall, United is a very good airline. The flights were on time, The planes were relatively clean. The flight attendants did a relatively good job. You can see that the airline is trying to do a good job for a reasonable price and I value that.    I have been a loyal customer for over 30 years. At one point I had Gold status. Then my status dropped with the addition of Continental. Overnight, it seemed that I dropped from the top 25% to the top 50%. Then, when I moved to management with less flying, I dropped to Silver. On the way back from Hawaii, I learned that even though I puchased the tickets while Silver, my bag limit dropped because I was recently dropped to ""Member"" status. I was hoping that my loyalty to United for over 30 year would have meant something, but apparently it doesn't."
Feb 2020,40,Good flight at a reasonable price,"My travel went very smooth. Flights connected perfectly and the staff were very helpful. Seats coul be a little more comfortable, but it wasnt bad."
Feb 2020,30,Nickels and Dimes,"United is a fine airline. Planes are clean, staff is.well.trained, we arrives early on every leg of the trip. But their pricing policy just pieces me off. Their Premium Economy is the most expensive I have seen. In Eco omy, they charge an extra $15-26 for an isle of window AFTER you have already booked your flight. Baggage fees are high, too. Give me one price for the whole deal,.please"
Feb 2020,30,Just another typical cattlecar flight.,"We expected it to be Grade C service, and it was: nothing really wrong with it, definitely nothing great about it -- what you expect from any U.S carrier other than Southwest. We used United only because we still have some frequent flier points with them; otherwise, it would have been Southwest."
Feb 2020,50,A wonderful experience!,"So in order to appreciate this flight, you'd had to have been on the AA flight we had from LAX to Auckland two weeks before! The difference was night and day! United's crew were very friendly, courteous and helpful. They served water and/or drinks every few hours (on a 15 hour flight, that's HUGE!) Food was better, just an all around pleasant flight. If you have to be confined to an airline seat for 15 hours, this was much more comfortable!"
Feb 2020,30,It was an ok experience.,"I've had to use them in the last 3 months for two trips to Miami to see my sick mom. It says straight when you book what kind of flight you are booking. I knew what to expect, so I only came with my backpack, aka personal item to avoid check in fees and carry on fees. It was super easy to go straight to the plane, and once you get off, you go straight to where you need to go because there is no need to wait at baggage claim. I highly suggest paying extra to book an advanced seat. This is one thing I won't be cheap with. Trust me, you want your preferred area to sit. With that said I can understand why flight attendants get frustrated from passengers levels of stupidity and arrogance."
Feb 2020,50,On time and safe,Flight was on time out for Las Vegas to Houston then on time to Orlando Florida. Both crews were very professional and polite during the service. They were very attentive of our needs and very funny
Feb 2020,50,Artist,United Airlines staff and crew give the royal treatment to its passengers. My connection was missed in the evening and I was 100% taken care of until my flight out in the morning. It was barely an inconvenience.
Feb 2020,10,Still the worst.,"I fly United as rarely as I can manage. The last flight I took, a few years back, was from Japan to LA. We had to keep our cabin lights on the entire flight, overnight, because of an electrical issue.    In Ottawa/YOW, I had a flight delayed 5 hours. There were no announcements leading up to departure time, I only saw this delay on the board. I went to speak with an agent and they told me they were busy boarding other flights. They boarded the only two other flights departing from the US terminal, and I went back to speak to the agent again. At that time, they announced they were giving out food vouchers. I was given two and they rebooked my connecting flight. By the time I walked to the restaurant, 10 meters away and within 10 minutes of receiving the vouchers, their kitchen had closed. The only meal option in the terminal. I would think that the agents would have considered this kitchen closure and rushed to give out food vouchers, given delays are a regular occurrence from this airport, but they didn't. Additionally, the weather forecast was very bad for this day and the next. However, we managed to have decent weather and the delay was caused due to mechanical problems. I understand this, but when it's late-February in Ottawa and there are blizzards in the forecast for the week, it would be best not to compound the issue with mechanical problems.    I could fly a hundred Delta flights and not have this experience. But a five-hour mechanical delay, and incredible inconvenience, on my only United flight in years is no surprise."
Feb 2020,40,Good flight!,A very good flight with a comfortable Business Class seat. The flight attendants were very friendly and the food very tasteful. ten hours with a smooth flight and no problems at all.
Feb 2020,10,The United MileagePlus program is a SCAM.,I was Cheated out of $850 as excess luggage charges as they made me Premium member while going to India but while travelling back on the same itinerary I was asked to pay for all my luggage which would have been OK if i had the same status as i traveled to India. Big cheater and biggest SCAM iI have ever seen by them.
Feb 2020,10,The Worse Airlines You Can Fly,"We first sat at the jet port after take-off time. I noted this to the flight attendant as you could see the flight crew parting in the cockpit. The pilot that gunned his engine, while dragging his brakes, all the way to take-off point. Then he announced that he had over-heather his bakes and we would have to sit here for 20 minutes to let them cool down. After we gained altitude, he bounced us through out the whole flight. When the pilot landed, at Portland, he hit the runway very hard causing everyone to be thrown around. If United was the only flight flying, I would rather rent a car and drive it!!"
Feb 2020,10,United- The Unfriendly Skies,We arrived 41 minutes early for our flight. United receptionist refused to take our bags because the cutoff was 45 minutes prior to flight. Explained that my mother was in a wheelchair to no avail. Watched baggage being loaded onto our original flight as passengers were boarding. Knoxville is a very small airport so there is absolutely no reason the baggage couldn’t have made it to plane in 40 minutes. The receptionist was not helpful whatsoever. We had to wait 7 hours for the next flight. 4 minutes late = 7 hour delay. United - The Unfriendly Skies.
Feb 2020,50,Great flight!,"Flew back to Savannah from New Jersey recently on United. Everything about the flight went very smooth. Professional crew, on time flight, and very prompt baggage handling. Well done, thank you."
Feb 2020,10,extremely rude experience booking a flight with a supervisor,"i was trying to book a flight for the 3 of us departing from Houston to Boston.  i fly around 15 times a year, this time i needed further assistance since i was miss-leaded by an agent.  the agent forwarded me to the supervisor named Summer.  Summer was very impatient and extremely rude probably since she recognized the fact i have a foreign accent.  the supervisor Summer mentioned things as ""i don't have to help you"", ""it doesn't matter what the agent promised you, it is what it is"".  she definitely disdained me speaking to me with a lot of anger, it took me around 15 sec to pull out my credit card numbers to give her and she didn't stop rushing me telling me ""quickly quickly if you want my help"".  no doubts that by far it was my worst flight booking experience, i don't wish that to anyone, i am very disappointed that a supervisor can take an advantage of the fact that she knew i am desperate to book a flight."
Feb 2020,40,March - UA656 Phoenix to Chicago 737-900 FC Seats 3E & F,"We flew from Phoenix (PHX) to Chicago O’Hare (ORD) on March 19, for a short meeting for my wife. We flew First Class on UA656 at 7:40am on a 737-900 (#3898) in Seats 3E & F. This was one of UA’s newer 737's, with the larger overhead bins, and the “dreamliner” ceiling. It did not have DirectTV, as do many of the 737's from the Continental Airlines side of the fleet, so we had great underseat room, with little space taken up by IFE equipment. This plane had just arrived at PHX from DEN.    Our morning was a bit rushed, and with the early Tuesday traffic, we did not arrive at our usual 90 mins prior to boarding, and then there was a line of folk at the curbside baggage check, so we had to go inside at T2. Not a great start, but we got to Gate 6A (moved from the near-by Gate 8), in time for the Group 1 boarding.    We were in our seats quickly, as boarding finished, and sat back with a glass of Spumante. The weather was nice, with broken clouds, but a fair amount of haze, which is a bit less common in Spring in The Valley. We were up into the haze pretty quickly, and on the starboard side of the aircraft with the rising sun, there was just not much to see. I normally go for the port side seats for the morning flights to ORD, but this was a rather last-minute trip, and those seats were taken.    This plane had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) streamed to one’s personal device, and it functioned well. Unfortunately, there was not much available, which I had not already seen. Still, a good way to kill time, when not working on the breakfast, or having a wine. There was WiFi (for purchase), but neither of us used that, so I cannot comment on how well it worked.    We had breakfast on this 3:15hr flight, which consisted of an a pastry with a scrambled egg puck sort of thing w/ a slice of Canadian bacon - sort of like an Egg McMuffin, but without cheese, and then Oatmeal with Mango. The oatmeal was the better of the two dishes. Each dish came with a Fruit Salad and Yogurt, and then a choice of breads: I got the Cinnamon Bun, and wife declined.    We had quite a bit of cloud cover, for most of the flight, but found some clearing, just west of ORD. On this flight, we overflew ORD, and out over Lake Michigan, before turning back. We got some nice views of the lakeshore, just as the clouds cleared.    Our seats were comfortable, but I like the FC seats on the UA Airbus ships, since they were all redone, a couple of years ago. Now, the larger bins on the 737's are very nice. I also like the closet in FC on the 737's, rather than the hanger arrangement on the bulkhead, behind the FC area.    Our cabin crew was excellent, and both friendly and efficient. Just “another day at the office,” for my wife.    We arrived within 10 mins of schedule, and our luggage was out quickly - we were off for downtown."
Feb 2020,40,March - UA1603 Chicago to Phoenix FC Seats 3E & F,"After a quick day of meetings just outside The Loop, we were heading home from Chicago to Phoenix on March, 20, on United flight UA1603, in Seats 3E & F (we had taken this flight on March 01, but on an A320 then), in First Class on a 737-900 (#3467). We arrived at ORD with plenty of time to spare, so headed to the UA Club on the B Concourse of T1. We boarded at Gate B-08 (moved from B-10) on time for our 3:52pm departure. Now, B-8 is a cramped little gate, but at least it has the newish 2-lane boarding scheme, which makes life much easier, and keeps the crowds down. One thing that I noticed was that this flight was completely full, with a waitlist. I had become accustomed to seeing that situation on United flights, but then some recent flights strangely had many vacant seats. I also noticed that not one person on the First Class Upgrade list made it - one reason that I seldom rely on status, miles or certificates, to upgrade - it is just not happening all that much any longer.    We boarded before Group 1, and settled into our seats with Prosecco, coats hanging in the closet in the front of FC. All seemed to be going well, until it was announced that there was a “fuel delivery problem.” Oh well, we had one of those last week, but this time, all went more quickly. Maybe United needs to pay their Exxon bill??    As nice as the weather had been on landing, the day before, it was now heavily overcast, spitting rain, and threatening snow. At least we were getting out, before the weather turned too bad, as we had to repack, once home, for another trip.    This ship had the PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) which feeds content to one’s device, through the United App. The latest version must be present, or downloaded, before the doors are closed. The streaming PDE worked fine. This service is free. There was also WiFi available, for a fee, but neither of us used that. The movie/TV lineup was exactly as it had been, on the PHX-ORD leg of this trip, with material, which I had already seen, so I decided to re-watch an older Starwars episode, knowing that I had most of 3 hrs. I suppose that is one of the downsides of flying the same airline so very often - one reaches a point where there is just nothing on the IFE.    Again, we did not get the warm Mixed Nuts after takeoff on this flight, and no explanation was offered. We experienced the same thing, on our March 01 flight. Maybe ORD has a ban on the warmed nuts? We ordered the Chardonnay, which was the Gravelly Ford California Chardonnay ’17.    The dinner was:  Moroccan Chicken w/ Grilled Peppers - this was the same lunch, as we had a few weeks earlier, on the same flight, and this version also was more tasty, than it looked. United needs to work on their food presentations a bit, and maybe talk the Trotter Project (their culinary team) into not using peppers on every dish.  Thai Chicken Wrap w/ vegetables. This was so much better than the Thai-style Beef Salad over Udon Noodles, which we had on the previous ORD-PHX flight. This dish was also better, than it looked. It was in some kind of a sealed bag, which was tough to open, especially as it was rather hot. We each had a mixed salad, and then Strawberry Cheese Cake – United seems to have 3 versions of their lunchtime Cheese Cake, and this one is OK, but the Pecan is better. I am not a fan of their Chocolate version, in the least.    I changed over to the Château Villotte, a Bordeaux blend, ’16. This was a new wine to me on UA flights, and quite nice.    The seats on this 737 were comfortable (less so, than the newish ones in FC on United’s A319/320 ships), but it was a newer craft, and had the larger oversized bins. Also, as it was not from the sCO side of the fleet, it did not have DirectTV, so more room for underseat storage. While the DirectTV (when it works) is a nice thing, and I could have used it on this flight, the equipment takes up a lot of underseat real estate.    We had taken off into increasing clouds, and were quickly above them, into the gathering gloom of evening. With the exception of a few moments over the Rocky Mountains, we did not see any clear weather, until our final approach into PHX. In general, the flight was smooth, with the exception of that time over the Rockies, when the Fasten Seatbelt lights were on, but that is common in the Spring.    We arrived only a few minutes late, onto Runway 26, so had to circle back, and around Terminals 4 & 3, to get to our gate (Gate 8) at T2. This has been fairly common lately.    This was a very good flight (except for the lack of the Mixed Nuts), and less inspired meal. The crew was very friendly and efficient, as had been both the Gate Agents at ORD, and the staff at the United Club."
Feb 2020,40,Flight without any incidents,The United flight was comfortable and uneventful. All the attendants were kind. Had an enjoyable flight. Plenty choices to watch on the screen.
Feb 2020,30,Good & uneventful flight,"Getting through the San Diego airport turned out to be pretty easy. We found the representatives and the flight crew to be efficient and personable. We were flying a Boeing 737-900 (twin-jet) (B739). The flight went by quickly, though it was not a commuter flight. There was very, very little turbulence. Though there had been some fear that snow would have been a problem when we landed at O'Hare, that actually turned out to not be a problem."
Feb 2020,10,Do not recommend,I’d highly recommend you think more then twice before you decide to book with United. You literally cannot sit comfortably in their limited leg room.
Feb 2020,50,A GOOD EMPLOYEE THE MOST HONEST EVER.,"My Mother lost her ID Visa without knowing in which airport. She traveled from Houston to Palms Spring CA and did not know where she fell it. Fortunately an Angel named FELIX RUIZ (United airlines employee) found her document and he contact to me.    We feel really grateful with him,because employees like FELIX RUIZ make a big difference in the airline industry like United Airlines. Thank again FELIX RUIZ"
Feb 2020,30,Baggage Fees,"We arrived from Liberia Costa Rica airport without issues. The take off and landing was fine. The free movies are a joke....at least 20 years old. If you change your mind during a movie and want to switch to a different one, you have to watch it from where it is planning. It won't start over. The drink service was average. The longer flight on our trip was a comfortable plane, but the smaller plane was very uncomfortable without head rests.    My reason for not flying with United again is the baggage fees. We took 3 bags and and that added $200 to our trip (round trip fees)."
Feb 2020,10,Disgusting Service,"I’m absolutely disgusted by the conduct United Airline has demonstrated. I was awaiting a partial refund since the 31st of January 2020, however I have been advised throughout 4 phone discussions the amount in question was close to 300.00 AUD and had been processed on the 9th of February 2020 and I would receive the refund within 3-5 business days. Today is now the 26th of February 2020 and I’ve been advised the amount in question has now changed to 70.00 AUD and I’d receive the amount within 14 business days. Now I have contacted several departments to get assistance from membership to refunds and made a complaint with customer care. This organisation are not organised or professional! I do not recommend nor do I believe this organisation is equipped to provide a satisfactory level of customer service."
Feb 2020,20,I have had it with United's fees and reduced service,"With my home airport being Newark, NJ I am forced to fly United more often than I care to do so. To help mitigate the extraordinary fees charged on luggage I have the Mileage Plus Credit card. I am sure to book each flight with the card since they started imposing their rule that just being a card holder was not enough. My latest flight was bought by one of my vendors for my wife and I but we purchased tickets for our children for the same flight.  Knowing how difficult it is to work with United, I called the day before the flight. United assured me that since our children were flying with us, and their tickets were purchased with the card, luggage would be free of charge.  You guessed it... We were charged $60 for 2 bags.    In addition, the past 5 times I have tried to use the United Club passes, (another ""perk"" of the mileage plus card) I have been turned away because the club was too crowded.    All of this combined with smaller seats, surly flight attendants and the faulty inflight entertainment has prompted me to finally give up on United.    The only consistency I have found with United in recent years is how CONSISTENTLY they have proven not to care about their customers!!"
Feb 2020,40,Cheap and comfortable,For the same price as spirit or frontier this flight had free movies and seemed to have more seat room. :-)
Feb 2020,50,Excellent Flight,Excellent flight and inflight service. Very nice lay-flat seats with excellent inflight entertainment choices. Great meal choices also
Feb 2020,20,"Too cold, limited free food","Both airplanes, HON to SFO and SFO to EWR, were far too cold. The ""blankets"" provided were basically large towels that offered little warmth. The three choices of free food were tiny."
Feb 2020,40,Gate assignment,"I arrived at Denver, CO and had several hours before my departure to Des Moines, IA. I checked the board for my gate assignment, it was to leave at A81. I made my way there through several speed walkways, downstairs, the train and more speed walkways to arrive in plenty of time. Sitting there waiting for my flight, I decided to re-check the flight status. The gate had changed - B58. Less than an hour to board. Back across walkways, train, stairs, walkways, made it in time to board. Sure would have been nice to have had a notification. I made it, but only by sheer luck."
Feb 2020,10,UA Took My 40lb Bag Off Due to the Plane's Weight Restriction on the Way to an International Wedding,"I was at Newark Airport 3 hours before my 5pm flight to Bogota to ensure everything went smoothly. There was a 3 hour delay due to weather so I arrived in Bogota at 2.15am. I waited until 3am for my luggage and then was told my bag wasn't coming due to the plane's weight restrictions. This was after I saw huge packs that must have weighed much more than mine - I had them weigh my bag at checkin and it was 41lbs.    I was on my way to a wedding in Cartagena for the weekend, so after 3 hours of sleep, went back to the airport for my flight. I had to spend Friday looking for something to wear to the rehearsal dinner instead of enjoying the city. And then had to pick up my bag on Saturday because I was worried it wouldn't arrive before the wedding.    Instead of United Airlines letting me know the status of my bag I was directed to 'keep calling' to see when my bag arrived in Cartagena.    I've spent hours during my vacation and after --the website was apparently not working so I wasn't able to complete the claim form online and was told to check back in a few hours on 2/20.    I've been a Mileage Plus member for decades and I'm extremely disappointed by the lack of service I've received."
Feb 2020,40,Good flights and service,"We flew United for a vacation to the island of Oahu. Overall, the flight was good and everything went well. We were a little disappointed with communications as we were not made aware that our tickets were “basic economy” until after the purchase was made. As such, we did not know about some of the limitations or have an understanding that the members of our group could be scattered throughout the airplane. Initially this was a surprise, but it worked out in the end.    As for the flights themselves, everything worked out well! We were able to depart MSP a little early and landed in Denver with some extra time! We departed from Denver a little early and got to Honolulu almost a full hour ahead of schedule! That allowed us to settle in better and have a little extra time on our first day!    Our return flight also went well! We had stops on LA and Denver coming home. The timing worked out alright but LAX is not a very consumer-friendly airport! In our gate area, there was not a “reasonably “ priced breakfast so we had to explore the gate areas to find something reasonable! It was a little frustrating—although that is not United’s problem!    We were able to get back to MSP a little early, also, so that was nice!    Aboard the plane, service was very good! We were greeted on each plane and thanked as we exited! The overnight flight from Honolulu to LAX offered fewer amenities but most passengers were sleeping so that wasn’t really a surprise!"
Feb 2020,50,Attentive and met Expectation,"Enjoying the newer seat configuration 1-4-1 across in business class. Flight attendant walked around with PJ to give out, without being asked for. Foods and ice cream sundaes were always good. Attendants were attentive and very helpful."
Feb 2020,10,Worst airline ever,This is my second flight on United. The first flight was a very bad experience & the 2nd even worse.
Feb 2020,30,Mixed feelings,"767 300 plane seemed OK but the interiors were rather old (except the seats with great quality IFE). Checked on the internet and the aircraft has had some stories behind ... Service speedy and efficient but rushed too. Food OK and I noticed huge inconsistency. 2 meals on a 7hr flight vs. one+snack on earlier Ams-Houston 10.5hr flight. Rally hard to understand. Fantastic pilots who managed to land smoothly when the storm (yet another one) was picking up in Amsterdam. Did the domestic flights (x2) in the US too. Quality definitely below EU cheap carriers (even Ryanair). Heard it is normal out there, especially the 0 inch legroom."
Feb 2020,50,San Luis Obispo to San Francisco to Boise,"I really like flying out of smaller airports. San Luis is as easy as it gets. The parking is a bit steep though. $18.00 a day.  Landing in SFO is fine as long as you don't need to leave security.  Flying into Boise and getting a rental car was the pain-free and the people are friendly.  Flying out of Boise was pretty much the same. The TSA people are actually human and have teeth and a sense of humor.  Outside of when my son-in-law worked for an airline and we used to get to ride in first class, It was the best flight experience I've had in my 58 years,"
Feb 2020,10,Video system not working,The video system did not work and could not watch movie. This also happened on trip over    Disappointing considering high price of flight
Feb 2020,30,Improved But Still Just Okay,Polaris is an improvement over BusinessFirst but it still falls far short of international carriers and even Delta.  We were on a 757 which I am not fond of for long haul flights. Perhaps the biggest improvement was in the foot room when the seat is reclined or flat. Seat control buttons were a bit awkward. Amenity kit was sub-par and I was surprised to see it was plastered with Star Wars advertising. Service was about average and certainly good. Food was also average.
Feb 2020,10,Disappointing,"We flew from Wausau to Cancun via American Airlines and had no issues, other than the flight was delayed a half hour. The pilot still managed to get us to our destination on time. We took a backpack and a small carry-on and did not have to check a bag.  We flew back to Wausau on United. When we checked in the day before, we were informed that we couldn't take a small carry-on on the flight, so reluctantly we checked our small carry-ons for $35 a piece. When we boarded the plane, there were several passengers who brought their carry-ons aboard, which were bigger than the ones we checked. This was very irritating..Also our connecting flight from O’hare was delayed more than an hour. We found out later that there was no crew assigned to our flight. We will do what we can next time to NOT fly United Airlines."
Feb 2020,50,Nice trip in United's Polaris Business Class,This was a very pleasant flight. Comfortable flat bed seats and pretty good food. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. The only problem was a labor dispute with passport control offices in Brussels. It took 3 hours of waiting in line and many people were missing flights. This seemed to be common knowledge among people in Brussels because the union had announced the job action three days earlier. But I didn't get any notice about getting to the airport much earlier from United. I was disappointed about that.
Feb 2020,30,"Terrible che, packed flight","Checkin was terrible. Frustrated, unfriendly, loudly dismissive staff told me he wasn't dealing with my flight yet even though flight was scheduled to board in ten minutes and told me to sit down and wait. Just trying to check an upgrade. In end, although my wife and I are IKs no upgrade. Flight in economy plus packed, flight crew did their best. Not sure why we didn't get the upgrade or even who got one."
Feb 2020,40,Great flight Guanajuato to Houston,"Great flight on smaller plane to Houston. Check in easy, boarding was great and the flight itself was very good. Very smooth, good service, nice meal. Flight was almost full so the extra room in Business was appreciated."
Feb 2020,10,Baggage fee hike,Shame on United for hiking their baggage fees. These fees all used to be included in the flight cost. Just another way to put more money in their pockets. Do not fly United. Boycott them. A little courtesy goes a long way. Remember your customers are the reason you are in business.
Feb 2020,10,Misrepresentation and incompetence,"I booked my round-trip ticket from Newark to Rome on United airlines app. I received a United Airlines reservation number and flight numbers. I noticed a week before the flight that the flights are operated by Swiss Air to Rome and LH from Rome.    I called United Airlines to ask them if my 2 free checked baggage allowance using my Chase Visa explorer plus card still applied. The agent said yes and I felt confident that I would not have to pay for my checked bags.    Unfortunately, this was not the case. When I got to check-in at Newark, I was told I must pay $120 for two checked bags. This also happened on my way back from Rome.    In all, I was charged $240 for two bags, round trip – I was told I was not going to have to pay this fee a week prior to my trip. After taking all the steps necessary to ensure that I would be getting my Chase benefit of two free checked bags each way, United failed to deliver this benefit.    I have had many service failures with United over the years, but I decided to give them another chance. This was the last chance- Never again!"
Feb 2020,30,Food,Travelled with my daughter on 18th February. The food choices were terrible. My daughter ate nothing on both flights. Should consider an option for younger travellers
Feb 2020,10,Terrible airlines,This has been the worst experience I’ve ever had with flying with United Airlines from Barcelona to San Francisco. One of the flight crew members by the name of Ashly had a bad attitude. I’m not sure if she was just having a bad day or what you still don’t take your problems to work. When she’s at work she should be able to provide an oustanding service to represent United airline. First she had a attitude with another passenger because he got up during the time passenger was to be seated when he had to use the restroom. Then she came to me and asked if I had wanted something to drink. I stated not right now because I already have my own drink. When I needed something to drink because I wasnt feeling well and was hyperventilating. I asked her can I have something to the drink . She stated I already asked you did you want something and you said no. I told her I said not right now because I had my own drink. Then she was like now you have to wait. I was surprised she would treat me like this when I wasn’t feeling well .On top of that my bag was a whole hour and a half late after I arrived to Los Angeles. I have been a loyal passenger with united airlines. This will be my last ride with United Airlines. Poor Customer service. Please contact me at (310) 340-4411 ASAP or I will have to escalate this higher up.
Feb 2020,40,Love love,"So grateful for united airlines. After spirit airlines cancelled my flight without any solution, I was able to book with United the same day. They gracefully worked with me to get a flight at a reasonable time and I was able to get to San Diego in a timely manner. The service and quality of the flight was great and I’m definitely a fan."
Feb 2020,50,The flight attendants were great.,Besides it being one of United Airlines new 777 which the first class seating was like having your own small one bedroom. Very comfortable and clean. One of the younger flight attendants was special kind. She was 100 a people person showing kindness in the first degree. It was fun passing the time away sharing herself to us.
Feb 2020,20,Bad experience on the way home,"On the return flight was informed our luggage was left behind due to weight issues. Was told our luggage would be delivered that evening or by early morning. Didn't happen. Called and was told it would be delivered by Sundat night. Never happened. Call Monday morning was informed it was on it's way. Nothing again. Called again Tuesdat am, was informed it was on its way and once again nothing. We informed them since Saturday we had to have the luggage by Tuesday am because my sister was traveling back to Denver to go home that afternoon. When we called again, they now told us the luggage was on a flight to Southbend Indiana. Horrible experience all the way around. Finally received the luggage in Denver on Wednesday. Will never fly on United again! Understand that luggage does get lost but the run around to try and get it here was a bunch of lies and crap dealing with United airlines"
Feb 2020,40,"Smooth, relaxing flight","I travelled San Fran to Sydney in United Polaris business class. It was over 15 hours long, so I was really hoping for a good nights sleep & a well thought out meal plan for this flight, both were achieved.  Pros:  - the lighting in the cabin was great and thought out well, lights out completely at a reasonable time into the flight to let everyone sleep as it was almost midnight when we departed anyway, but enough time for people to have their dinner if requested for that time.  - good entertainment system & choices  - amenity kit supplied with slippers too !  - great tasting food  - could request snacks, drinks, and small hot food dishes at anytime throughout the flight. AMAZING lobster mac & cheese, & hot chocolate too.  - fully lie flat beds  - helpful hospitable staff  Cons:  - the seat figuration is 2-2-2 which is isn’t desirable in business class, i was the window seat meaning when i needed the bathroom i had to jump over a sleeping mans legs who was a stranger to me & i didn’t want to disturb  - the seat was comfy enough in feeling, but quite tight, for anyone of a large size or build would definitely be not the most comfortable in these seats particularly when lying down, also angled lie flat seat meaning it becomes more narrow towards your ankles and feet, therefore very limited sleeping space  Overall i would fly the polaris business class again especially for the food, but is not the best business class there is."
Feb 2020,40,Full flight,Things went surprisingly well. WiFi worked great. Flight attendants were very on top of things.  I’d fly  It again
Feb 2020,10,I just hate United,"I have yet to have a good flight on United and my last flight just yesterday was the worst flight I’ve ever been on. First, the upgrades cleared for two of my kids but not me and my other daughter. Therefore two of my kids got taken off my reservation and they did not get precheck which forced us to have to wait for my son and daughter to go through the regular security checkpoint. They both had first class tickets which should have been a priority line as well. Then we get to the gate and there was only one seat in first so I gave it to my daughter. I sat in coach. There were no screens in the headrests and no one tells you to download the United app prior to takeoff. Then it’s too late. They only had 12 seats in first class but somehow managed to run out of regular meals and my kids were offered vegetarian wraps. Neither of them are vegetarian so they declined as did several other perturbed passengers. I wanted my kids to experience the joy of flying first class and they got none of the experience I wasted my upgrades on. No blankets. No pillows. No food. No entertainment. It sucked and I’m not happy. The flight got delayed and then delayed a second time as we had to go back to the gate for a maintenance issue. Arrived in NJ late and then waited over 45 minutes for our luggage which again should have been priority."
Feb 2020,30,It is never fun flying these days,We circled Denver for about an hour. Got diverted to Colorado Springs for fuel. That took for ever. Finally got to Denver for connecting flight.
Feb 2020,30,Not a disaster but the worst business class we experienced,"We flew business class.  Was ok in all. Especially the flight attendant who was a true professional .  But, The (pretty old ) plane was pretty noisy the whole flight, took a struggle to take the seat’s tray out. The power outlets didn’t work in our seats (“captain couldn’t reset it”).  I had to pay in business class for “inflight entertainment” ? That’s a first for me.  I didn’t care for the food:there was no meatless option (and I didn’t find where to order it ahead of the flight). The roasted checks breast was tasteless (salt helped a little and I found the potato and bread to taste “funny”. Coffee and wine were good.  The lounge was crowded. We hardly found a place to seat. Food/drink offerings were the poorest we encountered so far."
Feb 2020,40,Great lounge bad food on board,The lounge in Newark is great all around.  The flight was delayed by 4 hours due to a mechanical problem.  The seat on Polaris is excellent. This is really the most important metric for me.  Food (Kosher) onboard the flight was horrible - totally not edible.  The service was good.
Feb 2020,30,Best Option from SFO,"The legroom on the United 737’s is amongst the worst. It is mandatory to upgrade to economy plus if you are 6’ like myself. Very average food and beverage service, it’s good they have many flights to SFO since it’s one of their main hubs. OK for domestic travel, not so if you are flying out of country."
Feb 2020,40,The Airport at St. Lucia is Obsolete,"Through no fault of United Airlines the International airport at St. Lucia cannot handle the influx of tourist. United flies to St. Lucia once a week on Saturday and upon arrival we waited 40 minutes on the tarmac after landing for the pilot to be directed to a parking spot. After disembarking we snaked around passport control for 45 minutes because all the incoming planes landed mid afternoon.    On the return flight, the airport was so crowded it was hard to find a seat. The resorts say the airport suggests an arrival of 3 hours, and it you arrive sooner, the staff does not start to process your check-in until 3 hours before departure. Security pays no attention to seniors not having to take shoes off.    Upon arrival in O’Hare, it took 12 minutes before the gateway arrived to allow the departure door to open. Thanks to kiosks we breezed through passport control and luggage arrived in record time.    During the flight, the service in business class was top rate with good food."
Feb 2020,50,bargain flight to San Fransisco and los angeles,I bought a round ticket -San Fransisco- LA - London  was allowed free carryon on internal flight because part of international journey  Times offered were very good  Flights departed on time - check in was efficient  in flight entertainment and meals - surprisingly good
Feb 2020,40,"good for the price, but not as good as aeromexico or avianca","The flight was ok, no delays and the crew were very helpful.  I paid less that $150.00 for my flight, so i was not expecting big things from this flight and indeed, i was not able to select my own seat not able to pay for a selection. the seats are bad, they feel like a bus seats, or even worst, but still, thats what you expect from a cheap flight."
Feb 2020,50,Consistent & Reliable,"I look for timely departures and arrival, good variety of food, friendly cabin crew, neat bathrooms etc. All this I have got during my last flights UNITED AIRLINES from Europe to USA and back."
Feb 2020,40,Flight delayed due to mechanical problems,"Thankful that once we got to runway problem was detected before we could take off, so back to gate we went. Pilot very helpful explaining situation and said we would have to wait, that it shouldn't take long. Unfortunately we were delayed, sitting on plane, about 2 hrs!  I wasn't in a hurry, but many had connections in SFO and I believe they were assisted by crew to find other flights. Pilot kept us updated with progress of mechanics.  Flight went smoothly once we took off. BUT my complaint was that there was no compensation offered to those of us left on plane to sit for 2 hrs. No extra perks, no free food (other than usual snacks), no vouchers for discounts on future flights. Wonder if that's normal for United?!"
Feb 2020,40,Economy class air,Flights were delayed by several houra in each diredtion. Good alchoholic drinks in return flight (only)
Feb 2020,10,Appalled,"It’s unfortunate that I am posting this negative review because our flight was actually pretty decent. However, the incompetence of the United employees at baggage services and utter disregard and disrespect for their customers had me stranded in the airport looking at my bag through a glass wall for nearly 3 hours. Apparently it is a common practice for United to send luggage on earlier flights and lock them in a room in a different terminal, with no employee to assist passengers trying to claim their bags. I guess the fact that our first class bags, marked with bright red “priority” tags must be the reason we were bestowed the honor of traveling from terminal to terminal begging any employee we could flag down to help us by simply opening a door. As my husband remained on hold with customer service outside the room holding our luggage, I was told that an employee was there but we weren’t; even though he was standing there for over 2 hours waiting. It is appalling that customers are treated like this - dismissed, sent back and forth between terminals for hours, and having their “team leader” rudely putting his hand up to my face as I tried to explain that my luggage was not lost - it was in clear view in a different terminal; but United was just too lazy and disinterested to open a door. I think United Airlines should look up the definition of “priority” and maybe “customer service” while they are at it. I will NEVER fly this airline again, and strongly urge anyone who is even considering it to reconsider."
Feb 2020,20,Took my bag for no reason and made me pay for it,"I traveled with a group of people who all had a small bag, not a carry on with wheels. I checked in and paid for one luggage and was given my ticket. No one said anything to me that i wasn't allowed to carry anything on the plane. When I was entering the flight they told all of us we were not allowed anything to carry on. However, the website states everyone can bring a purse and a personal item and a carry on. I walked on that plane with no purse, no bag, no carry on. Every person I was with stated they were able to bring a personal small bag, back pack or similar on without cost and a purse, but no carry on and they were all purchased together. Everyone argued and they let them on the plane in front of me but took my personal bag with my wallet, medication and personal items and charged me $65 dollars and still didn't let me take the small bag on the plane and made me check it under the plane. In all my life, no one has made me check a small personal item unless the plane was full, even that no one ever took my purse or bag. I saw plenty of space under the seats and above the seats to store my bag. Why I was singled out from all these people and charged a ridiculous amount for my personal item was unfair. In all my life and my million travels, I've never been charged to take my ONE personal item, check it in baggage and pay $65. This could have all been avoided at the check in counter when I checked my bag and or these flight attendants seriously screwed up as the 5 other people I was with had their bags and couldn't understand why I paid. I will avoid this airline in the future if I have to, as even airlines such as Frontier or Spirit wouldn't charge me that absurd amount and force me to put it under the plane. I always travel with a purse and a computer back or back pack or something for small trips. Absurd."
Feb 2020,50,Great flight,For the 18 hour flight we decided we needed the pods so we could sleep. The pods were comfortable and slept and ate all the way. Stewards were great.
Feb 2020,40,"Weather cancellation, no problem!",Return flight out of Chicago was cancelled due to weather. I requested a reroute out of Wisconsin for 3 days later and they made if happen quickly and at no additional cost.
Feb 2020,30,Uneventful International Flight... That's GOOD news!,"Our flight home from Mexico was uneventful. Everything was on time. Connections through Denver customs were time consuming, but smooth. We got a beverage and choice of cookies or pretzels on each leg. Long, tiring journey in cramped seating, but luggage made it and we are thankful there were no hurdles to jump!"
Feb 2020,30,Flight was fine. Seats are just too small.,Attendants were polite and helpful. Pilots did a great job. Seats are way too tight with no leg room.
Feb 2020,40,Fine but not terriffic,The staff were great. The extra leg room and free bags great. But United gives no access to their lounge on domestic flights. Food was decent. Was it worth the extra money- I am not sure
Feb 2020,50,Still Flying United,"I use the United/Chase visa card and this allows me a $106 r/t ticket once I have 89,000 miles. Miles add up quickly and I did this flight in 2019 and now again in 2020."
Feb 2020,30,The flight attendant was helpful in finding a place for my carry-on.,"Seats are narrow and there's not much leg room. Most importantly, the flight was safe and got us there with no problems."
Feb 2020,40,"Easy flight , early departure, early arrival","Although I had been booked on a flight, I decided to go to the airport and see if I could switch to an earlier non-stop flight, so that I could get in at a reasonable hour. Pre-check and TSA went great and the representatives were able to get me on an earlier flight. We were on a Embraer ERJ-170-200 (long wing) (twin-jet) (E75L). We left nine minutes early from Tucson and arrived 41 minutes early at O'Hare in Chicago. The staff was friendly and efficient. It was nice to get back before dinner, rather than closer to midnight. Thanks, United!"
Feb 2020,40,Cross country trip,"The booking was to be roundtrip over a two week period, and although this was not a business trip it was a personal trip which was to deal with a family health emergency. The trip had to be extended to three weeks so a new return flight had to be booked with rescheduling charges and ticket price adjustments. However, this turned into a fourth week and a repeat of the cancelation charges, ticket price adjustments, etc. after 4 1/2 weeks we found it cheaper to cancel the return ticket after charges, and fly back to Portland on Alaska Airline. Lesson learned is that if you cannot guarantee your return date it may be cheaper to just purchase a oneway ticket. The final cost of the airfare due to the changes wold have equaled business class round trip."
Feb 2020,50,Good Airline,"I arrived at the airport and saw my name for upgrade to 1st Class,  an upgrade as a gift from my brother with his points. While I was happy to get upgraded, the only real difference was a larger seat, and a marginal lunch but I was disappointed that there was no TV screen, like most other East Coast Airlines. If I hadn't been reminded to bring an accessory Electronic Device I would have had nothing to do for 3.5 hours! Unfortunately there aren't a lot of Non-Stop options from Boston to Houston. Regular Coach class travel on the return wasn't anything different from any other recent airline. i.e. I wasn't ""WOW'D"". Rule #1 in airline travel: The less # of people who touch you bag, the less chance of it traveling farther than you!"
Feb 2020,10,Horrible Experience and Even Worse Response,"Long story short, this flight was delayed in Denver for technical issues and then rerouted to a closed airport in the middle of nowhere due to fog. I get the fog wasn't their fault but instead of just letting us go rent vehicles they kept leading us on twenty minutes at a time until finally putting us all in hotels at 3am. The next day we couldn't get back through security because our boarding passes didn't match the airport since we were rerouted and once we were finally through and out on the runway the flight was delayed again for technical issues. My wife and I finally just rented a car and drove home but now United refuses to reimburse us for the car rental. They gave us a $150 United credit which doesn't come close to covering the $500 flight that never even got us home, much less the car rental and the extra day we both missed work. Not to mention this $150 credit is basically Monopoly money. It's absolutely no use to me. I have no clue when or if I'll ever fly again so the credit will most likely expire without ever being used. I'll never fly with this airline again and I'll be sure to steer others away. I understand not all of the delays were their fault but they should have done the right thing by reimbursing us the amount we lost and with actual money not useless United credits. They could have had lifetime customers had they made up for the delays and taken care of us but instead they've created two lifelong haters of United Airlines."
Feb 2020,40,Interesting Flight!,Interesting to me because my connecting flight in Houston was delayed because they had to remove fuel from the plane as we sat on the tarmac. I assume it was to heavy for takeoff.
Feb 2020,20,Another greedy airline. Please for the love all that is holy put some padding on the back of the seats.,"Passengers in planes are simply livestock. They take things away to the point of absurdity. There is no comfort. There is no enjoyment. There is no relaxation.    The seats are the worst I have ever experienced. The padding on the back is maybe .5 cm thick. Zero lumbar support as well. On a 4 hour flight, it would be nice to be offered something more than a couple biscuits and a shot glass of beverage. Sure I can pay for more but I shouldn't have to.    I paid $1150 or so for a round trip ticket from Toronto to Houston. Direct flight. My friend paid $650 for a direct round trip ticket from Toronto to Columbia!. Go figure.    My son paid $1500 for a round trip ticket from Toronto to New Zealand. The prices are all over the map and the amenities are terrible.    Also, who designed that bathroom. I am 6'3"" and simply can't stand up in it. I know I am taller than average but come on folks.    Flying used to be luxury and I can say that United is doing all they can to change that. It was terrible. Hell, even first-class doesn't get a tv. Having the AC fail mid-flight was also a treat. When you have people sweating on the flight, that is a bad sign.    I will remember this experience for the next time to book a flight."
Feb 2020,30,Dulles A Concourse Almost as Bad as Newark,"The A concourse for United airlines in Dulles is poor. It's run down, confusing and difficult to get to, but not as bad a the A concourse at Newark airport which is the worse in the world.    Plus, the gate attendants rush their announcements and you need a decoder to figure out what they are saying. Make sure you take a patient-pill if you have to go through these terminals!!!!"
Feb 2020,40,Stress free on time flight,Routinely fly on United and have always been happy. This is a quick 2.5 hour trip and economy plus has plenty of keg room. I am a larger person so the seat width is tight but ok for a short flight (anything under 5 hours). The flight home actually left 5 minutes early and landed 15 minutes early.
Feb 2020,20,Not best airline.,We are big Jetblue fans but no direct flights from lax to Cancun. I’m 5ft tall and if no room for my legs who would fit. A 6 year old? Absolutely zero space between seats.  No movie screen or entertainment. Stewards rude and unfriendly. On time so that’s why 2 stars.
Feb 2020,30,Very few Business Class Seats,As a business flyer I was disappointed to learn thee were no Business Class seats for sale 10 days before the flight. It is hard to understand United offering a aircraft with only 8 business class seats on a 4 hour + flight. Both flights were full with a waitlist for both economy and business class seats. What is United thinking??
Feb 2020,50,A great experience,We were expecting to arrive in SFO around midnight. We arrived in Denver a bit early and rushed to the counter to see if we could catch an earlier flight that was just getting ready to leave. We were placed on standby. Not only did the attendant get us on but arranged for us to be seated together. The flight was good and we got our vacation going a few hours earlier by the attendant making it happen.
Feb 2020,40,Calgary -> Denver -> Texas -> Costa Rica and RTRN,"No complaints, all went well, we are a couple and were sat together on all but one plane. No delays and no difficulties throughout all six flights. Food isn’t offered but snacks and drinks are which is just fine for us."
Feb 2020,20,Greyhound of the skys,"I have not flyed Untited for many years and found myself on their planes going to Honduras. The first most aggrevating point is that if you fly economy they will not let you take on carry on luggage only a ""personal item"", like a purse. An upcharge of $95 was demanded for a carry on. (this is BS) The seats were dangerousely small. You could not exit the window unless all the passegers got out of there seats. Your knees touch the back of the seat in front of you. On some legs of my trip the TV and Wifi were inoprerable."
Feb 2020,10,"United - Total lack of humanity, worst airline in the world","I travel thousands and thousands of miles a year and I do everything I can to avoid flying United. Today was another unfortunate reminder of why I wish they would go out of business and spare travelers the pain of ever having to fly with them. The SFO customer service team is full of crabby old ladies who starting working for United when they were called the Friendly Skies and people still smoked on planes. Maybe they were friendly back then, but they sure aren’t today. The ethos of the company is to suck every possible penny from the customer and never do anything to help. Their SFO “customer service” team supervisor, Dory, should be employee of the month by those disgraceful standards. United, I truly cannot stand you."
Feb 2020,20,Try to Avoid Flying Through San Francisco and Skip the Cheap Tickets,"After being delayed for 2 hours at take off in Eugene, Oregon because of fog in San Francisco, we missed the connecting flight in SF to San Diego and waited another 2 hours in San Francisco. Fog in SF or other problems has happened all too often. Beyond that the cheap tickets we bought ended up with many added costs for basics."
Feb 2020,50,Customer service improvements!,"Well this is a review of the customer service experience with reservation as we have not travelled yet!  Due to the coronavirus advisories our flights scheduled via Asia was cancelled. I braced myself for a long hold on the phone and potentially being charged big $$$ for changing and rerouting me if at all possible.  Surprise!! I was almost immediately connected to an agent and she efficiently managed to change my flights quickly with no fees or penalties. Yes that is what one should expect as a basic customer service experience, but given various problems in pasts and horror stories heard this was fantastic.  Thanks United for putting your customer first. Now I am hoping the flight will be equally pleasant."
Feb 2020,20,Don't care is their bottom line,"I was booked to fly from Newark to Houston and then connect to my international flight to New Zealand and then Australia. We boarded as planned and sat on the tarmac for THREE HOURS waiting for a leak in the kitchen galley to be fixed. We were reassured that we would be taken care of at the other end if we missed our connecting flights, but when we finally arrived, the staff just brushed us off and told us to go the gate and said we would be taken care of there, which I was not. I had the presence of mind to find that there was another United flight going to Australia that night, found my way to that gate and demanded they put me on it and then connect me home, which to their credit, they did, but there was zero care from the airline staff and a lot of authority from me required to get myself home. The lady I was seated next to was a regular flier with United and said this is a regular occurrence. I don't know if other US airlines are any better, but I was certainly happy to leave the States and come home after this experience!"
Feb 2020,10,Do not fly United,"Do not fly United if you have a connection. They do not communicate, and at their main hub they do not even staff their one servicing desk for the volume of missed flights and problems people have had. My flight was delayed because they could not be on time due to the plane leaving late on the very first flight of the day. They are late at the start, and the lack of communication between their employees. Not to mention none of the employees look happy or like they want to be there."
Feb 2020,50,Best Airlines Ever,New plane for this last trip I made to Costa Rica. Awesome flight attendants and what a smooth ride! The new plane had so much leg room and I was very comfortable for the extended flight which was over 4 hours. Thanks United for caring for your customers. Still don't like paying for checked luggage though!
Feb 2020,10,seats too narrow and thin??,"United has chosen to make there Economy seast much smaller that in the past.  In the past seats were 23 inches wide, now they are 17 1/2 inches wide now??  I was put in a center seat because there were not any aisle seats or window seats open.  The man to my left was over 350 lbs and the lady to my right was over 250 lbs and their bodies were on my legs and shoulders. The flight attendants did nothing as they felt it would cause an incident even though policy says the oversized people are required to purchase 2 seats and lift the arm rest. By the end of the 4 1/2 hr flight I was sick!!"
Feb 2020,40,Great Service,The Flight Attendant somehow knew it was my birthday and he gave me a snack box!! Haven't seen that especially in coach for a long time.
Feb 2020,40,Flight from North Carolina to Maui,"We flew from Raleigh to San Francisco non stop so as not to have any missed connections. We then spent the night there so as to get a good nights sleep, get a little jump on getting used to the time change and to site see. The flight from San Francisco to Maui was a direct one as well that took a little over 5 hours, so we had a half day extra that would normally have been used up traveling. By buying basic economy, we were not able to choose our seats, so our party of 10 was all over the plane, mainly in the middle seats."
Feb 2020,40,Flying to Cabo San Lucas,Flight was delayed out of Columbus and had a short turnaround as a result. Ran like crazy to the second flight and found that because of many other delays they were holding the plane a few minutes to accomodate passengers - NICE!!
Feb 2020,40,Not bad long distance,"For 14 hours flight, the B777 was flying smoothly with 3/4 full, and economy plus helped a bit. Food is better than other UA international ones."
Feb 2020,10,"United Key West ground staff extremely disorganized,No repair staffing at airport,","We arrived at Key west airport at 7:00 and were told we were boarding in30 minutes.  After 30 minutes they discovered a mechanical issue with the plane which would be attended to.Four hours later we were told there was no united repair staff based at  airport and they called a unknown mechanic that had a commute to get to airport  and he had not arrived.We were offered a paltry cart with stale cookies and a$10  voucher which was pathetic.We were also told not to leave the airport.3 hours later we were told they were unable to locate the inflight crew who had left airport. so we  had to endure another hour until they could locate.Needless to say,all of this behavior was not befitting to the United professionalism I once knew.The surly ground agents.the irresponsible in flight crew and having low safety standards by  not having a repair staff combined to make me really think twice if I will fly United again."
Feb 2020,20,Ended up in Emergency Room due to baggage issue,"I was supposed to fly out on Jan 25th at 5 pm. Flight was delayed several times because the pilot did not show up. At a certain point in this fiasco, the airport I was to fly to had freezing rain. The flight ended up being cancelled. No certificates were offered. My bag with my medications was in the belly of the plane. I was able to arrange, with customer service's help, to stay nearby for the night because the next available flight to my destination was the next night. I figured one night without my medication would be ok. The next night, I arrived at the airport in dirty clothes and unmedicated more than ready to go home. There was an issue with the door of the plane at its last stop. It was delayed from 5 pm until 9:30 pm a half hour or so at a time. I was told that my luggage was then in the belly of this plane. When finally boarding, I received a call saying that my mother had a medical emergency and was being taken to the hospital. Tearfully, I had to remove myself from the plane home in order to get to my mother. I was told where to get my bag. It never arrived where it was supposed to nor at a different turnstyle that I was told it could have gone. I had to wait about 13 more hours and had to pay more money to get back to Phoenix. In Phoenix, I filed a claim for my bag. This is now Jan 27th. My bag was somehow sent to Ogdensburg, NY before I ever got on the plane on Jan 26th. However, the airline lost sight of where the bag was and rather than telling me the truth, lied about it being on a flight to Tucson where it would be taken by a delivery person and delivered to me in a few hours. If they had been truthful, I could have gotten my husband to overnight new meds). I ended up in the emergency room due to the lack of medication a few days later. My bag was finally found in Ogensburg and sent to me, arriving on Feb 5. I returned home Feb 7th. I complained to United and they did not even give me the courtesy of a reply. The only reason I intend to use this airline again is because it is the only one that flies within a reasonable distance of my home. The flight staff are wonderful, helpful and caring which is a plus. But when you can't count on the flights' timing or the luggage being where you need it and you can count on the food in premium to be abysmal and customer service to ignore you, you may as well choose another airline in my opinion."
Feb 2020,50,WOW that was easier than I ever thought possible,"I was scheduled on a later flight that was delayed, and there was room on an earlier flight, I asked and they slipped me in without a problem. The flight was not full so I got a row all to myself    This was a commuter flight, which I had not taken before, but it was nicer and much more comfortable than in one of those bigger planes where they pack you in.    I had paid to upgrade myself to First Class, which was not available on the earlier flight I changed too, even though I was listed in the cue for it. I put in a request for a refund, and there as no problem in getting that taken care of.    I am not normally a big United flyer, but I will surely use this regional service again."
Feb 2020,50,United airlines,"I flew from Chicago to Miami once a month for over a span of one year. I chose United airlines because in my opinion they were reliable, on time, reasonable flight cost and with classy personnel. I have flown on other airlines and feel that United airlines served my needs. Flying during each season of varying weather my experience was again one of reliability with United airlines.  O'Hare airport was easy to navigate from the curb, through security and to your designated gate. Each gate area was comfortable and clean. The airline personnel were always efficient in my experience. Food services were quality.  Miami airport was a little inefficient in its layout and signage could have been better. The car rental locations, once reached, were nicely spaced out with car pickups easy to navigate coming and going.  I used Hertz.  Overall United airlines deserves a look for your flight needs. I will definitely make them at the top of my list."
Feb 2020,50,Flying the Friendly Skies,"Recently flew to Tulsa, OK. From Calgary, AB., with a connector flight in Denver, CO. The inflight service was excellent & all planes taken were very new (Still has the new plane smell to them) & comfortable. I experienced no online issues booking the flights there & back with the exception of checking in on the mobile app on my phone when adding a piece of baggage. Apparently if you are adding the baggage on the app, if you live outside the USA, Guam or Puerto Rico you will not be able to complete your luggage checkin as there are no options outside those three. It works fine on the regular website or you need to check them in & pay at the airport, so that might be something you want to keep in mind."
Feb 2020,50,So improved!,"Just so great when boarding, seat choice, pleasant crew and timely take off and early landing all run smoothly. Captain kept us informed - and sound system was clear ( often not the case!). Had to pay extra over Southwest and Frontier BUT we’ll worth it as United has only direct flight from Denver to Fort Myers."
Feb 2020,50,Friendly Skies,United does have a good flight to Montego bay on Saturday's that connects through Houston. Other days not so good. Friendly employees and newer airplanes.
Feb 2020,50,United Airline review,"I always fly using United. I have never had any issues with this airline. When I have had to contact them for whatever reason, I get the help that I need. Most recently I had to contact them regarding a broken foot. All coordination from the curbside in PV, through check in, security and boarding was taken care of. This was good because my husband was freaking out as to how to handle me with my broken foot."
Feb 2020,20,steady problems having credited flights with partner airlines on MileagePlus account,"Whats the problem with this airline since once flying partner airlines obviously you need to run after them in order having credited mileage you generated with with their frequent flyer program - although you had provided with your account number already whilst making the booking. Now there are asking me to provide (again) with eTicket and boarding pass and furthermore to enquire for further data with the(ir) partner airlines I flew.    I understood a frequent flyer program as a marketing tool in order to tie a potential customer to an airlines, but with UA it seems more that they want to get rid of you.    Since when the bone is coming for the dog?"
Feb 2020,10,Worst Airliner in business,"United Airlines ultimately epitomizes scum of the Earth. Their regard for customers is non-existent. Their willingness to bring forth solutions to issues caused by them is non-existent as well.    I was not admitted onto my connecting flight by a United employee from Guadalajara to Houston after taking a mere hour long jumper flight from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico because United decided to send my checked bag (to Houston) to baggage claim in Guadalajara. As I was unaware of this, I did not claim my bag and was not permitted onto my flight despite pleading to simply leave my bag at the airport OR have the airliner send my bag t0 my address so that I did not miss my flight. This, unfortunately for a bottom tier airliner, was not a viable option in their eyes despite the fact that would have solved any issue. So now I have been denied 4 times in attempting to get a refund for the flight that United caused myself to miss AND the new flights/40+ hours of no sleep or eat as I made my way home to Jacksonville.    My itinerary went from (January 3, 2020) Puerto Vallarta to Guadalajara to Houston to Jacksonville    TO    (January 4, 2020) Puerto Vallarta to Guadalajara to Los Angeles to Houston to Jacksonville.    And to top it off, my bags ended up in Washington, D.C.    The incompetence from this airliner is ultimately sad. It is sad that we have companies and organizations that are so inept, so unwilling to help the one thing that keeps them up; their customers.    United Airlines is the worst airliner out there and I could not reccomend flying literally any other airliner more    DO NOT BOOK UNITED AIRLINES. DO NOT FLY UNITED AIRLINES.    Their customer service is as worthless as their flight employees."
Feb 2020,40,First Class all the way!,"Seats very comfortable and roomy. Attendants were attentive, lived up to the name. Flight was on time and smooth on both leaving Newark and returning. No problems and we were very happy with the experience."
Feb 2020,50,What you pay is what you get,"If you fly economy class, you can´t expect much. United delivers good services with good prices. Always the best services at the airports with very helpfull attendents."
Feb 2020,10,Trip of a life time ruined by United and their ground crew.,"The airline ruined our trip to Mexico due to their ground crew not being ready with the deicing machines. First one was empty when it got to our plane, the second one had a broken nozzle. We were brought back into the airport and sat there for almost 6 hours causing us to miss our connecting flight in Chicago, then we missed the 2nd connecting flight they set us up with. Had to stay the night in Chicago. We missed the first 2 days of a 4 day resort trip."
Feb 2020,40,Flying with Ease,"From the moment we booked our flight and explained that my fiancee had a disability and requested more leg room, they accommodated us. They offered us an Enconomy Plus upgrade considering our ticket was Economy. Our flight attendants were professional in- so-much that when I hadn't received the alcoholic beverage that I ordered in a timely manner, they offered it to me free of charge with a gracious apology. The flight was awesome...quiet and what should have been a 2 hr & 40 min flight was only a 2 hours 10 min flight! When we landed, there was another flight assistant waiting who wheeled my fiancee to baggage and then to the street to await our pick-up. It was a nice experience and I will definitely book again."
Feb 2020,10,Not Satisfied,"This flight was delayed 4 hours !!!! They made a quick gate change at 8 pm, which made us believe the flight would be immediate, to then find out the departure time was change from 7:59 to ""10:46"". The flight did not board till after 11:20pm. The plane was then delayed once again due to traffic in the departure lane, we didnt actually begin flying till 12pm or later. The arrival time was 1:48 am . I am highly frustrated with this airline and this experience. I traveled with my husband and my 1 1/2 year old baby. On top of this I am expecting, 8 months pregnant, and dealing with my baby so tired and uncomfortable sitting and trying to keep her still for 4 hours was ridiculous. The fact the flight was delayed last minute due to the airplane no longer being available is the BS excuse, that should not be allowed. If there is a flight bought and scheduled, this should be accommodated and finalized so that these instances do not occur. The flight was also very turbulent !! The overall experience was horrible . I am very unhappy with this airline rght now."
Feb 2020,10,Disappointed in first class,"One would think that Champaign would be served in a glass flute,,rather than plastic, or that on the return breakfast flight it wouldn’t take 45 minutes to get a cup of tea. Or that the tea wouldn’t have been so terrible? How hard is it to make a cup of tea. Also, internet really should be free in First Class. Furthermore, on the return flight the attendants were surely."
Feb 2020,40,Bumpy flight but great service,I have used United a number of times and my outward journey from Edinburgh was not great but the return was much improved so have chosen to review the better flight. On the back of bad weather we flew through more turbulence than normal but still felt relaxed although had to hold my drink to stop it spilling everywhere! I’m a relaxed flyer but with the conditions when they were allowed I thought the flight attendants were friendly relaxed and supportive of those not as comfortable with the turbulence. Food was good they were good at offering drinks and snacks again when it was possible
Feb 2020,10,Misguidance wrong information,"I got sick while visiting India on a vacation. Called United and they said no problem and said since you got sick we will waive change fee. Then when I got better called back and they said you need to pay difference in fare (understandable). They found the comments by previous agent which noted that I have told them no change fee as for medical reason. Then they had to call another person who decides fare and this passed on I have to pay change fee 300 USD and difference fare 550 USD. new ticket from united as well as other airlines was available for 550 USD while they had the audacity to ask me 850 USD. I am sure the airline is set up to fool/swindle unsuspecting customers. I told them how could you say that to me earlier as you already saw comments by previous agent that there will be no change fee. They said, well that agent probably didn't know all the rules. WTF."
Feb 2020,10,5 day Luggage Delay!,"Our first flight was delayed, in turn we missed our connecting flight. After the first UNITED customer service agent sent us on a wild goose chase for a connecting flight that had already left a second agent helped us find a flight to another airport to catch another flight that would take us to our destination that day. In the meantime a UNITED employee took our luggage off the plane and put it in a United baggage claim/ carousel instead of putting it on our next connecting UNITED flight. Our luggage took 5 days to make it to us on our 8 day vacation. The final flight that took us to our destination was a different airline that never touched or saw our bags. After spending countless hours during and after our vacation (which was ruined) both airlines are pointing the finger at the other. American got us to our destination and never touched our bags but has to compensate us for replacement items because they were the last carrier. And UNITED who is actually responsible for the error refuses to give us any sort of compensation for this. 5 out of 8 days of our vacation we had NO bags. On the 4th day we were told (finally!) that our bags HAD gone to the baggage claim in the first airport and they hadn't been found so were most likely to have been stolen. A United employee called us that same night and told us they had found them in UNITED'S baggage holding. (no wonder American doesn't want to pay for this) But will still take NO responsibility for this and REFUSE to do anything to compensate us."
Feb 2020,30,Very uncomfortable plane,"Had a window seat on row 31, very claustrophobic with the cramped, small 737. Window was dirty, TV control not working (watched four hours of United commercials), window shade broken and my knees were touching the seat in front of me. The 737 is noisy and far less comfortable than the A320, and United hasn't made it any more comfortable with their packed in seats. Even the rest room was barely wide enough to turn around."
Feb 2020,50,As always great flight.,We always fly on United and are over all pleased with their service. Especially the Narita staff has always been a good experience.
Feb 2020,10,Great airline if you value terrible service and botched vacations,"Our Mexico vacation started with a United plane having issues with its brakes. After delaying the flight 30 minutes, another 30 minutes, and so on for a few hours, we had to catch a Lyft ($140 out of pocket) to the nearest airport. That flight got us to our layover in Denver where we had to spend the night - United paid for the hotel and $20/person which is about enough to cover a bag of chips and a drink in the airport. We caught our flight to SJD the next day and arrived 24 hours after our scheduled arrival effectively donating the first day of our vacation to United. I specifically asked the agent who moved our departing flight if they would cover ground transportation to the other airport and was told ""yes, you'll have to submit it for reimbursement on United's website."" I submitted our expenses to United and was told reimbursement is against their policy, they won't honor reimbursement, and was offered vouchers - the problem with vouchers is they don't address the expenses we directly incurred due to United, they have to be used within 12 months which won't work for us, and we'd have to actually pay United significantly more to actually pay for a flight - essentially a slap in the face. This isn't the first time I've had issues with United. If you book with them, expect delays, expect to pay more to get to your destination, and expect to be lied to."
Feb 2020,50,"No long lines for checking bags, on time, smooth as silk","All went well with this flight both going and return. Nice that it was a direct flight and everything was right on schedule. Competent piolets, friendly flight attendants. Both flights were packed with passengers and still the process went smoothly. Easy check-in by phone text that United initiated."
Feb 2020,50,"Actually, a nice domestic flight!","A decent window seat with a middle seat empty (Yippee); and good, pleasant service. No complaints. No little kids near me!"
Feb 2020,50,"Huntsville to Dulles, VA","Great service, smooth flight, on time, doesn't get much better! Gate service was friendly and informative. Look forward to taking UA in the future as my business takes me to Huntsville often."
Feb 2020,50,Patricia A Born,So nice to travel first class. Attention and care by staff and room !!! Easy for husband who is disabled. I am fortunate I have the resources
Feb 2020,20,"The Unkind Flight Attendant- Feb 15, 2020","I was traveling from Dominica Republica- with my family- two kids and a husband. My husband and son got food poisoned on the last day of a family vacation. Both were cared for at the local clinic, but they were still unwell. In STI airport, I showed the doctor notes; someone from United Airlanes brought my son a wheelchair. Then, The flight from Newark to Boston, the female flight attendant was speaking about my son's health condition with unkindness to the other male flight attendants- she made sure that they came by to see my kid up close and one of them said: ""lucky you, for getting a sick kid, hahaha"".  I did not find it funny."
Feb 2020,30,On time departure & early arrival,"Parking, transportation to the terminal, check-in and the journey through security went with no problem. The gate staff was friendly and efficient. We boarded a Embraer 175 (long wing) (twin-jet) (E75L). The flight crew was helpful. We left on time and arrived ten minutes early. For a glorified bus, the flight went well."
Feb 2020,10,ripped off and mistreated by United,"people, DEFINITELY DO NOT BUY the fake ""insurance"" that is offered to you when you buy an airplane ticket to cover problems like cancellation, delays, lost luggage, illness, etc. IT IS A TOTAL RIP-OFF, just another of the millions of corporate lies we regular people have to deal with constantly. when you try to make a claim, you will NEVER SEE A DIME even though your situation is exactly the one of those you had been trying to be careful about. yet another example of big companies stealing from regular everyday citizens with their deceptions, half-truths and misrepresentations. JUST DON'T BUY IT! more corporate thieves of the type being protected by all current governments, be it Trump with his pardons of criminals, the EU with its blind eye turned to everything, or whoever your current leader/dictator may be. buyer beware! especially with this bogus ""insurance"" sold by United Airlines. don't even consider it. I won't go into all the gorey details, just suffice it to say I bought this in case of an illness, I got an illness, but now the insurance company is making countless excuses not to refund me the money on my ticket, and the insurance company AIG (a totally separate entity) is obviously in collusion with United Airlines to rip off passengers. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT buy the insurance offered when you purchase a flight EVER. NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER!"
Feb 2020,10,Bad and Getting Worse,"I sent the following complaint to United Customer Service today. Withing an hour, I received a response (below the complaint). I've flown nearly 2 million miles on United, but no more. The quality of service in all cabins is poor; the food selections in economy are horrible; the food served in business and first is stale and unappealing; many very old, un-reconfigured planes are still in service.    Here's my complaint: I paid for first class on one of the longest routes you fly in the continental US (Miami to SFO).  I did not get a first class experience, or anything close to what I paid for.  For the second time in recent memory, I was aboard just about the oldest plane in your fleet, a 737-800 that must have been around 25 years old.  It had not been updated since delivery; the floors were filthy; the seats lumpy, without a footrest, and otherwise hugely uncomfortable; the power port didn't work (an issue for a business traveler on a 6.5 hr flight); no blankets or pillows were available; and the food was beyond terrible.   I would like a refund, not miles, for this experience.  You owe me the difference between a coach ticket and a first class ticket.  Sadly, I flew to Miami on American in coach.  Great experience.  Amazing food selections, comfortable seats, and excellent service.""    United's response: ""I 'm sorry our aircraft's appearance didn't meet your standards. I've reported your concerns so we can work with our airport teams and improve the cleanliness of our planes. Our goal is to make your flight as enjoyable as possible. I regret we let you down with the plane's appearance.  Since you do not want goodwill miles, please accept our apology for your experience. We do not offer refunds based on your dissatisfaction with our aircraft. We greatly value your loyalty; it's always a pleasure to serve your travel needs. We hope your next trip delivers the experience you deserve."""
Feb 2020,10,Flight from hell DON'T FLY UNITED!!,United OVER BOOKED the plane and would not let anyone on until someone step up and took another flight. Finally someone did and they let us on but they let 51 people on with only 50 seats. Now we had to wait again until they figured out the problem. By now 3 planes moved ahead of us for deicing. So we sat on the tarmac for 2 1/2 hours. By the time we got to Chicago all our connecting flights had left. I filed a claim with them for a lost day the vacation in Belize and just wanted my Hotel refund. They say it was weather related so NO REFUND! DON'T FLY UNITED!!!!!
Feb 2020,40,Good flight from Charlotte to New Orleans,"As an example, I fly most of the carriers; American (later this week) United for the flight I'm writing about, Southwest next month and Spirit in November. United is a good, average carrier. Customer service is ok, nothing spectacular but not terrible. Our flight up was great every step of the way. Our flight back was not. The cabin was not secured overnight and we had the first flight out the next morning. An overnight downpour left a significant amount of water in the airplane forcing them to change planes and delayed our departure for more than an hour. Now, weather had delayed alot of what was flying into and out of the connection (Houston) so our connecting flight was delayed and we made it. Overall, United has slightly more legroom for economy seating, the rest is about average compared to other carriers. All things being equal, I am more likely to fly United but seldom are all things equal."
Feb 2020,10,THEY DON'T CARE,"Once again United strikes and never tells you!!! They moved one of our party of 5 from Row 26 to Row 32 separating him from his 3 small children AND never notified us!!! This is the second time United has done this yet they have the utter nerve to say the ""customer is our most important focus"". Why ask about the age of children accompanying an adult(s) if you don't care about keeping them together????  Recommendation: Avoid United whenever you can because they don't care!!!"
Feb 2020,30,First Class isn't all that!,"Going to Hawaii was awesome, comfortable and good service but coming back was a whole different story. I'm not a demanding person and try not to ask for to much but our treatment coming back was absolutely absurd, definitely not 1st class! On the long haul, the attendant only served 1 dinner tray! When I asked for another tray I was told there wasn't anymore! Then my 9 years old accidentally spilled her drink that was left there for almost the entire trip, she was soaking wet, The attendant had the aisle blocked for the captain to be out of the cockpit, they were laughing and joking and carrying on, I went up and asked for assistance to clean up the mess and admittance to the bathroom so I could help my autistic 9-year-old change, I was denied this as she said the capt. is out of the cockpit, ok can I at least have some towels? Which I was finally given a couple of paper towels! I was also told to go stand in a long line for the economy restroom to get her changed. She doesn't do lines or a lot of people well that is why I sprung for first-class, to begin with. The attendant and capt. continued laughing and joking around for a while then after about 15 minutes he went back in and I finally got to get to the restroom and help her change, I had a very difficult time getting any drinks, finally caught an attendant from the economy that was walking by and he got us a couple of drinks. I did write United several times to notify them of the treatment we were given after paying for these expensive tickets and the fact that I had to go almost all day without any food due to not being served 2 trays, never ever heard back from them at all. I'm very disappointed and doubt I will fly United again, especially dishing out the funds for first-class! I'm not rich, in fact, I live on a fixed income due to a military disability from overseas duty, so paying for 1st class tickets was a big deal to me but necessary with the way they handle the economy and inability to reserve seats before the flight."
Feb 2020,20,Comparatively inferior,"I booked this trip on a 3rd party site. I travel especially light, usually with a backpack and carrying a change of clothes. Never been a problem, even on the cheapest flights. This airline required me to pay extra to check my extra clothes because I couldn’t stuff them in my bag- $30 for about a half a pound of baggage. Absurd, inflexible, will never spend my money with this company again when there are far more reasonable options in the same price range. Be careful when you buy and keep an eye out for scams, I got the same flight from American for the same price that didn’t charge me to check clothing."
Feb 2020,10,Wish I Could Give 0 Stars!,"T E R R I B L E customer service. My entire trip got “cancelled” because I couldn’t make my flight to Orlando because of a serious emergency (I wasn’t even BS’ing them unfortunately). I gave notice that I would not be on the flight there but WOULD STILL BE FLYING HOME. I then found out at check in time that my ticket was CANCELLED??? The customer service was extremely inefficient, and not understanding at all of what I was trying to explain. I ended up having to waste the entire round trip ticket in the end and book a whole new flight home (chose a new airline). NOBODY told me they would cancel the ENTIRE trip on me when I told them I wouldn’t be taking my flight to MCO that day. This has been a very unfortunate waste of money and loss of trust in an airline who I regularly fly. See ya never United!"
Feb 2020,50,Great experience,Had one of the most pleasant flight experiences I’ve ever had on United in five years about a week ago. The flights were all on time and the staff was wonderful; some of them were even telling jokes and had the passengers laughing. Keep up the good work!
Feb 2020,50,Mr.Aaron Taylor,"I would highly recommend United premium plus,the seats are real comfortable with plenty of leg room you also get a small amenity kit something that I thought that only business class gets.You get to board with group two,which means you get to de-plane ahead of regular economy, and you get excellent service from the flight attendants. Here you have a very satisfied customer."
Feb 2020,20,Seems Like They Want You To Suffer...,"Buy tickets together, choose your seats, and get the exact opposite. My group and all other families/groups around us were split up and randomly placed...EVERY TIME I have flown with United. Even better when they do this with 20 unoccupied sprinkled throughout.    United is not flexible or accommodating when your schedule changes either. So expect them to reject any flight request changes (even when you buy the insurance) because it is much more important that you remain randomly seated on that original flight you picked out seats for, but won't get.    Also when flying over the ocean from one country to another - for some reason we had an over packed tiny plane with even smaller seats than their other models. You would think a larger plane with more room for passengers to breath and recline would make sense. I'm not big at all, neither was the passenger sitting next to me. Yet we still constantly bumped arms. Ridiculous!  Never again United.  Bye."
Feb 2020,40,Much improved over our last United experience,This was a very smooth experience. No delays. No issues with anything. Seats were as comfortable as could be expected. Entertainment was fine. And our luggage arrived with us. Yay!
Feb 2020,40,Winter Vacation,Nice easy flight. A little weather but not problem. typical snacks and beverage. Could have had us fill out forms on plane for customs
Feb 2020,50,Good flight. No Problems!,"I take this flight 3-4 times a year. Thankfully United does not disappoint on this flight. Business Class is comfortable and the flight attendants are attentive. I'm not much for airline food, so I don't eat it. I have a large breakfast and bring some fruit and cheese should I become hungry. It's not a terribly long flight so I can usually hold out until I land and then try a new eatery."
Feb 2020,10,Disgusting opportunistic gouging,"My family and I where scheduled to fly from Denver to Toronto on the evening of Presidents Day, as a very busy travel day we of course had to pay a premium price as one would expect. Unfortunately 2 of us fell very ill the night before and where in no safe state to travel. We called to change our flights to the next day, a much quieter day for travel. Despite “doing their best” and consulting with their fare expert they could not seem to find a seat for us on any flights for less than $2700 extra!!! What an absolute blatant and appalling lie that was! I will never ever fly this awful airline again, and as a family that travels regularly this will certainly cost them more in lost business than the $2700 they just stole from me."
Feb 2020,20,I wish there was an alternative to this airline,First of all the flight was delayed by an hour arriving into Bonaire to pick us up. Then when we got to the gate at Newark the plane was directed on to the wrong mark at the jetway. We had to wait 20 minutes for a tug to come and tow us 10 feet so that the jetway would attach to the plane. There were many people on the flight who had tight connections who probably missed their flights. I wish there was another airline I could take from Newark non stop to Bonaire but there is not.
Feb 2020,50,"Thank you, United!","When our cruise ship arrived late to port (7 hours behind schedule), we missed our flight... arriving at the airport as our plane was literally headed down the runway. The toll-free United phone agent went above and beyond to get us home that same night, so my husband and I didn’t miss returning to work. Although our problem wasn’t caused by United, they provided exceptional customer service, and saved the end of our vacation from being a stressful mess. We are grateful and can’t wait to fly with you again!"
Feb 2020,50,Good experience,"The flight crew was attentive. I had no issues with this united flight. We departed on time and landed on time, That's I all i expect from a carrier."
Feb 2020,40,Old School Service,"Was flying back to Chicago on a Saturday afternoon on what is usually a fairly busy route for United, however by flying off peak times - fares, seats and quite frankly service were all much better.    I give much credit to the crew (both gate and in-flight) for excellent service - airport was quiet but they treated the flight as if it were a Monday morning commuter flight. At the same time in flight was relaxed and they even made an extra service pass. Wonderful experience - highly recommend if you can fly off peak times - greatly enhance the travel experience."
Feb 2020,10,Newark customer service- they don't know the meaning of it.,"We had a flight to Las Vegas from Dublin via Newark, unfortunately our flight was delayed flying out of Dublin so arrived late for our connection flight from Newark.  We were put onto another flight which meant 5 hours wait at the airport, we weren't the only ones there were total of 7 of us. On getting ticket we were sent to one desk by the gentlemen standing at the gate, once we got to the que after waiting in this que about 10 mins the gentlemen at the desk just shouted out he was closed and that he wasn't serving us and to in to a different desk, after we all waited for him he was rather rude about it, when asked by another man who had missed the same flight over the same reason could he not wait 5mins to serve us he said no there's to many of us. We then went to a different desk for new flight I asked was there any compensation for the delayed missed flight and was told no. How ever 2 other couples were given $60 food/drink coupons for the airport, when I asked why didn't the rest of us get them I was told we were not entitled and that the customer service agent who we were dealing with was not told to give compensation to us. I even emailed about this but I was told the customer service would be spoken to and that we would not be receiving any as they were incorrectly given out. Weather or not they were given out incorrectly or not, our flight was delayed too, we missed our connecting flight too, we had to pay again to gettransport.com to book another car to collect us from the airport, we also had to spend money on food and drink in the airport for our 5 hour wait. Fair is fair.  This airline clearly doesn't treat all the customers the same! Airport staff in Newark 100% need more training in customer services."
Feb 2020,10,Worst flight ever,"Thank you United for quite possibly the most uncomfortable chair designed by man. Five stars for the sheer rigidity of the thing. It's tiny too, but that's not where it really gets you. I'm 5'8"" and have... Wait... HAD no back problems, but the steel reinforced concrete cushioning fixed me up pretty good. Now I know how a medical cadaver feels.  I'm also wondering if United takes applications for the 8 year old who must be in charge of early morning flight lights and dings... My kid could rock the light switch rave they were putting on at 5:30 AM. From 5 am takeoff to 7 am landing, we got about 27 minutes of dark cabin. Not in a row, mind you, that would be crazy talk. But lucky for us all, when United did manage to string together 5 minutes of darkness, sleep was no option. They made sure to blast pilot announcements at 800 decibals so we didn't miss the temperature in Denver or the opportunity to fill out a credit card application. Thank GOD I got that info instead of sleep.  To say that the cabin was hot wouldn't do justice to the amount of heat required to produce the 4 liters of ball-sweat I was able to shed. I'd have thought I pissed myself but the sweat was also up my back and oddly on my upper lip and top of my head. I appreciate United clearing every sweat duct on my body. It was almost like a spa... If that spa we're to force you to watch an amateur DJ while you laid down on a concrete slab and put a blow dryer in your face."
Feb 2020,10,Rude!,"RUDE and Impatient customer service at baggage claim!  I just went in to get any updates on my luggage and was give. Short answers before she even let me explain my situation! If you don’t like working with the public and don’t have patience, find a different career! This new morning lady didn’t care or want to hear my situation. Very unapologetic as if I was bothering her restful nap.... meanwhile I’ve had to sleep on a hard chair- I  Sure she got to sleep in a warm bed last night ! Be a little more empathetic!!! This woman was working United Baggage claim at baggage Claim10a 6:45 am 2/18/20 Very rude!!!! Sarcastically shrugged her shoulders and said Sorry. Just gonna have to wait!  If the First Lady wouldn’t have told me my luggage would be here at 12:30 I would have left the airport to be with family and friends- confirm OR keep me updated with the text! A NIGHTMARE!!! I’ve been working for a month straight! I want my luggage and to go HOME!!!!!"
Feb 2020,10,United delay,"Had to be in Newark for business.  I usually fly JetBlue and Delta, try to avoid United but try this time given convenience of flight. Mistake  Left the gate on time.  Had to return to gate for “medical emergency “ although passenger walked off the plane.  Then the delay started, we had to refuel?  Fuel truck took 30 min to arrive.  I understand a medical emergency but not enough fuel??? 45 min to refuel?  Needless to say I will not fly United again"
Feb 2020,10,Lost CARRY ON,"Lost my fragile carry on- didn’t arrive at my destination- the lady wa super nice and said my luggagevwilould be here at 13:30 am. It is now 6:08am and Still NO luggage. They’re now saying 3pm. This was supposed to be a short visit with family but now that is all ruined because I have to take time to go back and forth to get my lost luggage that I NEED- my meditation AND valuable pieces I purchased while on my company business trip. No compensation! I leave Wednesday the 19th so if it’s not here they don’t deliver over 150 miles away. Too much value to leave at the airport when I noticed they have left luggage outside of their baggage claim door that is LOCKED?!!! Ruin trip to visit family beforbI go back hone to Myrtle Beach,SC  They should come me a flight- even stand by cause I’ll be sleeping here another night so my family doesn’t have to run me back and forth to airport and so don’t have to spend a few $100 in uber / taxi rides!  This was a bad experience! Take all medications/ valuables out if they say they need to “complimentary “ take your carry on bag so you don’t have to experience this! It’s horrible! I’ve spent a month in Tucson working long/ labor hours for the Tucson gem show and all I want is my property- Praying my fragile pieces are not broken- I see how our luggage is handled -just found a rip along side my NEW luggage too! I rode with Spirit airlines and didn’t have any issues Shaking my head! Get it together United!    I do have to say the lady at baggage claim was Very nice and understanding. It wasn’t her fault but she did tell me that my bag would be on the next flight from Texas and that didn’t happen! Hopefully they can accommodate me on my inconvenience ..... doubtful!"
Feb 2020,50,Great service,Had to give a shout out to United Airlines and it’s partner Mesa Airlines for my recent trip to Leon Airport (San Miguel de Allende) to Fort Lauderdale. Both flights were on time and were handled professionally. Great service.
Feb 2020,50,Took care of us when they didn't have to,"Our basic economy tickets dod not allow any changes but, when our cruise ship was delayed due to an injured passenger, United allowed us to change to a later flight"
Feb 2020,10,Horrible Experience,I travel to India once or twice a year. Even though the United ticket price was compatible but I would not recommend it to anyone. The seats are small and hard. The aircraft was old and ill maintained. Dinner was a small tray of a spoonful of rice with undercooked peas and garbanzo beans. Salad was stale. My nephew got food poisoning. It was 15 hours of pure hell. I have travelled economy by many other international flights and I still can’t believe this was an airline from an advanced country like USA.
Feb 2020,50,An overall good flight,"This was a fairly long flight onboard a Boeing 767-400 in business class, the flight was smooth the entertainment system was more than adequate, time went by quickly. Food on board was good and the service was good"
Feb 2020,20,"Hired out Incompetent ""employees""","I am a novice traveler. I have flown a total of 5 times. 2 times to Mexico. I suffer from major airport anxiety and lack confidence to go through the entire process of checking in, security, boarding alone.  I booked a 14 day vacation with a 35 year long friend in Puerto Vallerta but had to meet her THERE because we live in different cities.  I actually downloaded the app, paid for my luggage, $40 for one piece, AND checked in ALL on my own without a glitch.  The app showed my boarding pass & my paid luggage.  Perfect!  I arrived in San Francisco 2 1/2 hours early. Went to the kiosk, PRINTED my correct boarding pass AND luggage tag. Upon looking at the stickered luggage tag, I felt I needed the airline to attach it for me correctly but i tried anyway & ripped part of the bar code.  So, i proceeded to the man at the United Airlines bag check counter.  He was immediately abrupt & harsh to the young couple in front of me with a baby in their arms & 2 toddlers telling them he could not check them in, he does NOT work for UA & they needed to go to the other side, where they were TRYING to state they had just come from & were told to go to HIM!  He hastily brushes them off & says to me, ""Next""...  Looks at my luggage tag & says No, i need to go back to the kiosk & see one of the (3) attendants there & have them reprint it.  The kiosks were busy 🤨  So I waited my turn.  I overhear one of the attendants state,"" I do not work directly for united airlines. I am just here because of the superbowl but she proceeds to ""help"" me anyway by taking both my luggage sticker AND boarding pass & going to the counter leaving me at the kiosk.  She never looked at my passport, asked me my name or where I was going.  She came back, stickered my luggage, handed me a boarding pass & sent me back to mean man to check luggage.  He checked it & I went to the gate on my boarding pass.  Had 2 mimosas & at 15 minutes to departure, as I was group FIVE to board, proceeded to the gate.    Approaching the gate, I looked closer at my boarding pass, (I had found my glassses)...  And see not only CANCUN, but someone else's name!!!  Man at the counter checks my phone boarding pass & says I'm 10 gates away & 10 minutes to take off, that I'd better run.  I made my gate AND my plane but was SICK to my stomach the entire flight with anxiety. With no TVs or in flight movies, I pretty much cried for my entire 2 hr 45 minute flight with my eyes shut.  I arrived in Puerto Vallerta more than an hour before my friend.  However, my luggage did not.  It went to cancun 🤔🤬  So, now I'm on an extra long vacation because I WANTED THAT MANY DAYS TO RELAX, & now, im trying to not only make calls internationally but I'm also trying to remember everything I can about THE WRONG BOARDING PASS I was printed by a person IN an airlines UNIFORM so I can HELP THEM find my luggage!  I connected with Alexandra from UA customer service via phone & she was AMAZING!! She did detective work & kept me email & text updated. Called me in one day when she located it AND had it hand delivered (by the sweetest mexican man I could not have been happier to see! I tipped him $10 american dollars !) to a very remote little beach town north of Puerto Vallerta!!!  THANK YOU ALEJANDRA💋🤗...    BUT, my very sweet, simple SCENTIMENTAL WEDDING DAY GIFT of a waterproof bluetooth speaker & case (as we got married ON the beach & music is both of our passions)  WAS MISSING OR GONE!  My luggage was very obviously rummaged (again, anxiety!)  No notice in there from TSA like I've seen in mine once before.  I have not contacted UA directly on this matter for 2 reasons.  One, I AM TIRED OF BEING ON THE PHONE.  & two, I dont believe it will get me anywhere or my valuable item back.  Jus be warned.  Take care of yourself.  Dont trust then to help you or take responsibility at the airport.  Their phone customer service & Alejandra would get 10 stars though if I could ."
Feb 2020,20,They could care less about economy premium travelers,"I am trying hard to find an airline to be loyal to, where I only use them regardless of price and just rack of miles. After what happened today I'm done. I like to fly with only a carry on and really don't like to check bags. Usually when I fly premium economy I get a group 3 boarding group, but this last weekends trip I was group 4 and I didn't get any overhead bin space. To pay for the top tier out of 3 tiers of economy and not get a overhead bin is TOTALLY RIDICULOUS and not how it should be. I was early on in Group 4 and when I got to my seat EVERY seat around me was already filled. So either everyone who was sitting in premium economy has a United Credit Card or for some reason I'm being left out and I have no idea why. After doing some research I see that Delta guarantees their economy premium flyers overhead space, so it looks like I will try to give them my loyalty and business from here on out. Really a shame."
Feb 2020,40,"They do the best they can, bottom line - profit","United Airline personnel are great! The service they provide under the conditions in which they have to work is outstanding. The seating on some of the smaller jets is really close, but we had one Canadian plane with great leg room."
Feb 2020,40,UA,Flying out of O’Hare has greatly improved. From self checking on line and self checking luggage.    UA greeted us upon boarding and departed. The pilots kept us informed on arrival time etc. Flight attendants seem to genuinely care about your comfort.
Feb 2020,20,Homeward Flight,"This flight was full to capacity. One couple on the flight was travelling with 5 children. The children were out of control, running up and down the aisles screaming. The United flight attendants did nothing to stop this from happening. It made the 2 hour flight very unpleasant. When we arrived in Newark, we were not even told where to claim our baggage once inside the terminal."
Feb 2020,40,Toronto to Seattle flight,"I love the UA app. Uptodate info , gate change info , standby list info , so much more i can say . The crew were excellent and service smooth ."
Feb 2020,20,This airline has gone downhill,"We flew a combination of premium economy and business. Both were disappointing. The crews were not friendly and I felt as though we were a bother to them. United charges a fair amount for these flights and I still had to pay for each checked bag and any snacks on the flight outside of pretzels or a soft drink. From Houston to San Francisco there was no in flight entertainment unless you have the United app on your phone or tablet. I find it unlikely I will fly United again if I can avoid it. They were my favorite airline for many years, but not anymore."
Feb 2020,30,First Class Price with Economy Entitlements,ALWAYS check the type of plane you fly on! Going to Hawaii was First Class. Coming back was not what we paid for. If you are flying First or Business DO NOT fly on a 737-900. Reclined 4”. Not a Lay-Flat Seat. Service was RUDE and in accommodating and RUSHED to say the least. The food was less than average and the drinks were only given to you if you flagged down a cabin attendant.    Will not fly United First again.
Feb 2020,20,Terrible experience with international flight,My husband and I flew from Panama to Newark (an international flight) there were empty seats but they sat us right by the bathroom where the seats would not recline. There was no food provided during the 6 hour international flight and drinks were only given twice. We also had to pay for wine which is always free on international flights. I would not recommend this airline for international flights.
Feb 2020,50,fantastic service,"recently flew to and from Chicago with United. It was a great experience, staff really helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them. Good choice of entertainment and in-flight service was excellent. We will definitely look to book with United in future."
Feb 2020,10,"Rudest flight attendant, belittling",When the flight attendant gets on the intercom and tells the people in the back that they didn’t pay enough to sit upfront. And then the entirety of the flight make announcements about if you had paid more you’d be up front with the white folks. Yeah I’ll never fly United again for any reason.  I had already paid for my return flight and couldn’t get it refunded but still chose to Uber an hour to San Jose airport to catch a different flight to avoid United airlines and they rude tactics. They should be completely ashamed and I’m now not surprised they had a PR nightmare recently.  Even though we had to pay for another flight with SW I much prefer to pay again than ever deal with the worst flight I’ve ever experienced.
Feb 2020,50,Happy flight with UA,"Flight was ontime and service was great. My husband and I book in separate reservation. We asked to have us change seat to sit next to each other, she was quickly and happily made it happen. We were very happy to be able to sit next to each other all the way from IAD to Santiago with layover at Hourston. We'd fly with United Airline again and recommend for others."
Feb 2020,10,United sucks,"Horrible airline nickel and dimes you, app works to pry info from you, but don’t try to find your boarding pass without taking the time to upgrade and load other apps to make theirs work. Now they have our 12 year old seated 5 rows away. Never again."
Feb 2020,50,Grateful they were flexible,"Three days after buying our tickets to D.C. I realized that there's a discount that I am entitled to through work. The staff at United were so kind to make an exception and cancel my ticket, allowing me to re-purchase it while applying the discount. I sincerely appreciated their flexibility.  **Note that this incident occurred in February 2020. My trip is in May 2020, but the question below didn't allow me to enter the correct date."
Feb 2020,40,Good Flight,"On time. Seat very comfortable. Food and beverages plentiful. Staff very professional and courteous. Enjoyed the flight, had been a few years since flying so good experience was welcomed."
Feb 2020,50,"Kerry Allen from customer support is the best. She is kind, friendly, efficient and professional.","I booked this flight yesterday and needing some assistance from the customer support. Kerry answered my call. She is so friendly and professional at the same time. She took care of what I thought any other airlines would have given me hard time with. She was very attentive and thorough and just so kind. I haven't had this type of service from the customer reps from other companies. I am a 1K member for last several years and was thinking about trying different airlines next year, but I am definitely staying with United."
Feb 2020,40,Family Vacation to celebrate a birthday,The flight was great. But then how could it bad flying first class. Service was attentive and often. The comfort of the flight was expected and not disappointing. Airline food though better than it used to be is still not great. I stuck with the yogurt and fruit. My only complaint- no true brewed DECAF coffee.
Feb 2020,40,"Overall excellent, few hiccups","Business class was quite relaxing. Worth the upgrade price. I didn't get the toiletry kit at my seat for some reason but it was my first time in business class, and I was taking care of 9 year old twins so I didn't mind.    The outbound flight had been delayed, and the staff gave us snacks and water while we waited. Coming back home is always great after travel, and I generally have a good experience with United. Realizing that all airlines can have issues, I guess I have been most lucky with this one.    To be fair, check-in process at Delhi Airport is always chaotic and we were screened three times before boarding. The business class ticket gave us access to lounges on both ends of the flight, and the Neward United Business lounge is a dream. BUT the staff at the Newark airport was less than friendly. I don't know if they thought we were lost (my father, me, and two kids perhaps not the usual business contingent) but they were terse with us and I felt profiled. Still, the facility was excellent and completely ours at 6 am!    Having flown all major US airlines, I find United the easiest to deal with for customer service. But far as staff goes, I feel just as profiled as an Indian person (compared to the fellow white passengers) as on any other flight. Such is life."
Feb 2020,20,UA 328 Denver to Honolulu is substandard,"This 7 hour trip is a long way to go with no meal service included. Sure they have food for sale- but for a 7 hour trip. Yes I did get two diet cokes tossed in. The seats were uncomfortable. There was no entertainment- yeah I know you can use ""your personal device"" with the United app. This 777 needs to retire."
Feb 2020,20,My surfboard arrived with 2 dings,"The flight was excellent, smooth, outstanding customer service. But when I arrived in Guam, I waited an hour for my surfboard, which never made it to the flight. It arrived the following day but with 2 dings. That’s just mishandling gear that’s labeled fragile all over and it’s in a thick travel bag. It almost seemed that it was done on purpose. United offered me $50 voucher or get my board repaired at a local surf shop. I went for the latter option. United could not deliver.  The worst part was dealing with United baggage claim. It’s full of incompetent personnel. After 7 visits to the airport and 2 months later, I finally received a call that my surfboard is fixed and ready for pick up. When I picked it up, I found out that one of the dings had not been fixed. Imagine that! We’ll, after another week, it was ready, but the second ding was fixed with a solarez patch kit instead of done professionally. I was just mesmerized at the level of incompetence. The surf shop was Lotus.  I’ve gotten dings fixed in Peru, California and Florida and never had any issues or had to wait an eternity.  United Airlines can do much better than this."
Feb 2020,10,United is lame,"If I’ve said it once I will say it a thousand times: United sucks. I normally fly Alaska and I generally don’t expect a lot from people because I never know the type of day they’ve had, but I swear every time I fly United the flight attendants are rude to another level and for no reason. On this particular flight I had packed a small carry on bag because I had a 40 minute transfer time in Chicago that turned into 2hrs, and when I boarded in Portland the overhead bin area was full of people puffy jackets and computer bags/purses that easily could have been placed under their seats where a personal item is meant to go. The flight attendant in the back of the cabin, rather than apologizing and asking people to place things under the seat in front of them, proceeded to blame myself and three other passengers in the same situation for not knowing that the bin space would be full and for slowing the boarding of the plane because we had no where to place our bags. The same attendant also blamed me for getting my elbow smashed by the drink cart when she pulled it down the aisle silently at 20 mph. My experience was very similar on my second flight from Chicago to Philly. I truly think they should focus a bit more on hospitality training because it would make their flights a least bearable."
Feb 2020,50,Work Trip,The flight attendants were so cheerful and friendly. Attention to detail for all the passengers needs. Food was served hot and was good quality. Water and snacks brought every 30 mins throughout the night between several services. Was a thoroughly enjoyable flight.
Feb 2020,40,Newark to Phoenix,"Overall nice flight and pretty standard United Economy Plus experience. Full flight so even as a 1K I was unable to secure an upgrade, so ended up in row 8, the first after First Class. No food and two drink services throughout the flight. No frIlls but space was generous for coach. Seat was worn and in dire need of upgrading.  Boarding was a hassle in Newark as the gate area was totally crammed and there was barely room for those eligible for pre-boarding. EWR sucks!"
Feb 2020,30,"Friendly crew, food for purchase",This is a straight flight and plane was comfortable though Toilets seem old.. Drinks and cookies was offered so bring your food with you. Unlike in Asian flights where food is provided (unless its a low-cost airline) in Europe/US most foods are not included but they have available food for purchase.
Feb 2020,10,First Class is a Joke,"I arrive at the counter and instead of the employee behind the counter processing my check-in, I process my check-in. The whole thing. I'm the one paying, but I'm the one doing the work. This was even more-so on the way back at DEN.    I'm on the aircraft sitting in my (tiny) first-class seat. The pilot comes over the intercom and announces that because it is snowing at the United hub in Denver,(who'd of guessed Denver would do that?), some of our bags would not be going with us on this flight. Apparently, the toy airplane United uses to fly non-stop from JAX to DEN, (Embraer something-something), cannot carry the baggage that United promised to carry when they advertised non-stop service from JAX to DEN when it is snowing in DEN. Where United has a hub. They sell tickets for non-stop service from JAX to DEN, but they can't carry the baggage.    So, whose bags do you think they select for non-service on this flight? If you guessed first class passengers who bought their tickets with money, you guessed correctly!!!!    That's right! In thanks for buying the most expensive ticket on the plane, United rewards you with leaving your bag in Jacksonville!    Who wouldn't want to fly United again after that?    Then, during the flight from JAX to DEN (sans luggage), they serve what we shall call for lack of alternative terminology, ""breakfast.""    Again, this is FIRST CLASS.    What is ""breakfast?"" It is, and I quote the first-class flight attendant as she described it to the passenger seated in front of me, ""shelf-stable cheese product.""    Yeah, baby! Shelf-stable cheese product for the win! How many Michelin stars can we get for that???    (Back in the Army, we had white cheese stuff that you put on the two crackers that came in an MRE - I think that cheese might of been more palatable. I'm not sure.)    I'm not sure, because, while first-class (did I mention this comedy takes place entirely in first-class?) flight attendant offered this shelf-stable cheese product breakfast to all of my first-class companion passengers, she never actually offered it, or anything else, to me. I was ignored throughout the flight.    But I did get to listen to the gossip between the economy class flight attendant and the first-class flight attendant for about an hour and half of the flight, covering topics from dating experiences to career aspirations or lack thereof.    So, I land in Denver, intending to head into the mountains, without the contents of the suitcase I assumed (first-class ticket, non-stop flight to the airline's hub airport) would have arrived with me on my flight. Examples of missing items: boots, crampons, poles, ski jacket, underwear, so on and so forth.    The check-in at Denver for the flight back was even worse, but the fight itself much better. No complaints with the DEN to JAX on the plane. But the JAX to DEN crew were depressingly lame. When I was younger, I used to travel on Greyhound and Trailways bus lines. I do not exaggerate to state that I have had better experiences there than in United first class (at least they never left my bag behind).    United sucks. Shareholders, especially institutional money, should throw the management out. They don't know what they're doing. It's a disaster."
Feb 2020,40,long trip to Hawaii,It has been a few years since my wife and I took a flight and I was surprised how the airlines cut back amenities On a 7 hour flight tou would get more than a couple cookies but they came around several times for beverages. I guess that's the price for cut and keeping down . prices. Other the flight was smooth and we arrived ahead of schedule. If you want more go 1st class but we couldn't justify the extra cost.
Feb 2020,10,Delay,"Holding a plane for people coming from Cabo. Waiting over one hour on the hot plane. Ridiculous to hold 2/3 of the customers to please 1/3. United has never held a plane for me and I’m sure that thousands out there would agree. I am surrounded by many angry people saying they will not fly United again. I sure hope the 19 people we are waiting on are worth it because The customers on this plane are extremely unsatisfied. Terrible, terrible lots of little ones crying. This really sucks."
Feb 2020,20,Flying 1st class is for the seats only,"I wanted to fly 1st class because I do not like the economy seats on flights longer than 3 hours. I also use the toilet frequently since I have BPH (benign prostatic hypertrophy). The food on this flight was terrible!! I can't even remember what I ate but it was so bad I left most of it untouched. Had I known the food was going to be that bad, I would have brought my own lunch! The movies were outdated which I already saw 4 out of 6. The ear buds kept no background noise out so you could not hear the movies dialogue. The bathrooms were dirty and there was turbulence for the majority of the flight."
Feb 2020,40,Employees were nice,i flew United on Feb 10th at 10pm flight and it was nearly empty. I had a good night sleep coming to Orlando for 2 hours. Plane was only half full so i could spread my arms and it was a good experience. I sat on 24 row and entertainment system didn't work but i didn't care since it was a short flight.  I want to Thank Ms. Sober that works in United customer service at Newark airport booth to take care of me. The crew in the airplane was really nice too.
Feb 2020,10,Mr.,"Best free advice you'll ever get:  Stay away from United. They delayed the Boston to Newark flight and texted me to find a replacement flight from Manchester NH or Albany NY....poor customer service, total disrespect. Take Greyhound not United and you'll be happier!"
Feb 2020,40,nice experience,Very nice service from united. it took us 3 flights and 24+ hours on a plane to get us from argentina to japan. Service was consistent and we took off and landed on time
Feb 2020,30,Did not assess the mechanics or ability to fly until after passengers boarded,"On a recent early flight out of Newark, the plane was sitting overnight at the gate. We were the first flight of the day. The pilots boarded; the passengers boarded and took their seats. At this time, it was announced that due a mechanical fluid issue we would all need to exit the plane.    There was over a 2 hour delay to repair. I understand the need for mechanical repairs.  But, why was this not assessed BEFORE we boarded the plane. Processes should be changed to assess the plan’s condition before passengers board."
Feb 2020,50,Fast and High in the Friendly Skies,"Took the 7 A.M. flight on a clear Tuesday morning.  We were greeted at the curb by a friendly bag agent. Nice way to start the day.  Plane took off on time even though we had a full flight on a 757. The flight attendants were on top of everything. We all had personal entertainment screens on the seat in front of us. The seats were roomy and comfortable. The plane got up to 40,000 feet: I don;t think I;ve ever flown that high before and we were doing 580 MPH. Flight smooth and turbulence free.  At the Fort Lauderdale end the bags came out within 5 minutes.  Are you sure I was flying United?  I bang them when they are bad, so I have to give them their due on this one.  The terminal area for United in Newark is all brand new and there are many places to eat and drink.  The flight was reasonably priced.  All I can say is I hope they keep it up."
Feb 2020,20,Awful customer service.,"This actually happened in September 2018.    We were on vacation on the coast of North Carolina. Hurricane Florence was coming in. We were forced to evacuate North Carolina and ended up in Tennessee. Most airports in North Carolina basically closed and stopped all flights going in and out. So we call United, because my flight is a week later out of Charlotte, and they dont want to help us, didnt want to help me move my flight, I would've even be happy if they charged me a fee. They didnt want to help me rent a car, or anything. They basically left me out to dry. I had to BUY another flight at almost 400$."
Feb 2020,20,Communication?,"Flight gets a 12 h delay over night. No info regarding accomodation solutions, ground crew without a clue, and the kicker? The first officer is not there at the initially targeted time the next morning. Meaning we all stood up at 4 to make it to the airport for nothing: here are two more hours of waiting for you.    Not bad on a >5k USD business class ticket. Will avoid United whenever possible."
Feb 2020,10,Lost My Luggage. Again.,United lost my luggage again. It would be comical if it weren’t so frustrating. This is a terrible airline. And no one is empowered to solve problems. I can’t believe I got duped into flying with this turkey of an airline again.
Feb 2020,10,Delayed 36+ hours!,"I was 2 days late for a work event because of this airline's incompetence (technical problems with the plane, not because of weather). Please choose any other airline. They robbed me of a weekend I'd been looking forward to for months!"
Feb 2020,10,Awful experience!,"I was supposed to arrive at my destination Thursday at 3 pm for a weekend conference for work. 2 cancelled flights and 1 delayed flight later, I finally arrived 2 am Saturday morning. I'd begged the lady at the United baggage claim desk at BWI to help me with getting a taxi and she didn't care and didn't help. I was crying from so if the anger and disappointment and stress and sleep deprivation, and she was completely unsympathetic. I paid nearly $500 for this flight and this is what I get?! Unbelievable! The LEAST they could do is comp me for a taxi and they couldn't even do that. If they ever want me to be a customer with them again, I'd better be getting a damn refund. United ruined my important weekend. Unacceptable."
Feb 2020,10,Apathetic and unhelpful,"I am livid with United! I missed half of the conference that I was flying to because of 2 separate technical difficulties on your end. When I got to my final destination hoping for a voucher for a taxi to get to my destination, their employees were unhelpful and apathetic. I want my money back. Thanks."
Feb 2020,50,"Inexpensive, excellent flight and service.","Inexpensive airline tickets. Flight was fast, comfortable and most importantly safe. Snacks and beverages were served.  Grateful."
Feb 2020,50,Comfortable flight to Puerto Rico,"I really enjoyed my flight to Puerto Rico on United's Boeing 767-400. The seats were comfortable for the duration of the flight, offered sufficient leg room and featured a more traditional seat back entertainment screen.    Staff was really friendly throughout the flight, coming often enough with drinks and snacks to keep passengers happy.    Check-in and baggage drop was very efficient at EWR and luggage delivery was quick in SJU"
Feb 2020,40,Flew United from Colorado springs to Hobby airport texas,On time good flight short layover. Changed planes in Houston the airport was a little challenging to navigate our first time there.
Feb 2020,50,Issue handled,Due to weather my inital flight home was cancelled. Called United. Was informed of a reschedule of 7:58 am the next day. Arrived. Had an issue getting my boarding pass. Irma at Additional Services informed me that our compant agent had united refund both tickets. She immediately made a phone call at 8:15pm and even though I had to pay with my company cresit card United was able to get me a boarding pass on the same flight so I could be home with my family on Valentines Day.    AWESOME!!!
Feb 2020,10,United's Poor Customer Service!,"Though I bought a Premium Economy ""bundle"" for this flight 824 from LAX to Boston on February 7th, the stewardesses made all passengers in rows 7 to 9 move. The pilots said it was necessary to redistribute the weight in the cabin - something I have never heard of before. Those of us in rows 7 to 9 had to find other seats, after having boarded, before the plane took off. We of course had to move to the back of the plane for remaining seats, and therefore did not have Premium access nor more leg room, for which I paid $185 for that particular flight.    I put in a claim the next day as the stewardesses recommended. The customer service people turned down my refund, implying that I made this up to get a refund? I have flown on United at least ten times in the last few months.    Don't fly United. They are cheap and they are rude to their customers. I, for one, will certainly not use them anymore."
Feb 2020,40,Easy FLying Experience,"As usual, we had a good flying experience with United. We received multiple notices for checking in, gates, gate changes and boarding. We flew out on time after an orderly boarding process. It was on time. It was actually under booked. We had overhead storage room, and roomy seats (for an airplane). The in flight service was good and we were given clear instructions for immigration. We experienced no problems."
Feb 2020,50,Nice flight,"The flight was nice and fast. The landing was a little hard, I guess because of the fog and rain. When we got to the airport it seemed like quite a few of the officers were off due to the super bowl. It took us 3 hours to get through customs, thousands of sick people coughing and sneezing, (including me )and only 4 windows open."
Feb 2020,30,United's Disappointing Mileage Plus Program Changes,"I recently achieved the 3 million mile status with United airlines, have been at least a 1K for many years and even reached the United Airlines Secret Society of Global Services in 2014 and 2015. My favorite all time airline was Continental who unfortunately merged with United a number of years back which was a major disappointment at that time since the Continental Team was great! (Those employees are still noticeable and still exist. When you receive excellent service, ask that person if he or she was originally with Continental. You are in for a surprise.)    My recent disappointments involve several issues:    1. The recent change from Premium Qualifying Miles (PQM's) to some point system described as PQP along with the number of flights. Thus far, I have flown roughly 11,000 miles which would have been 11% of reaching 1K status. I have less than 1000 PQP that equate to roughly 4% of reaching 1K status.    2. Last year, I achieved 230,000 PQM and spent over $43,000 on tickets, and probably closer to $75,000 since my wife traveled with me a number of times. I thought that I had a chance for Global Services again, especially since I recently reached the 3 million mile mark. I guess the blogs that say at least $50,000 in spending must be true.    3. With regard to the old regional and global upgrades, and now the new point plus system, those upgrades as as elusive as winning the power ball lottery. A few years back, a 1K member and probably others could get a confirmed upgrade seat on a reservation. Those, with one exception which I will discuss below, are no longer confirmed at the time of reservations, but you are placed on a wait list. I know a lot of 1K members who are upset with this policy.    4. There appears to be a limited number of seats on a limited number on flights where you can use something like the equivalent of four (4) of the previous global upgrades for a confirmed business class seat. However, once reserved, you lose those points if you make a flight change. So far, I have not seen such a fare, and would not gamble on using it.    So, as a long time, many decade, 3 million miler flyer on United, I would recommend to the young traveler to find a better airline for your loyalty and on who will treat you better than United."
Feb 2020,50,Excellent Flight from Paris to Chicago,Checking in and flight was great. Leg room is normal for the economy class flight. There were many movies to watch and all the controllers for the entertainment system was working. We were served often and good quality lunch and breakfast.
Feb 2020,40,good time keeping,"We were flying to pick up a cruise and were very pleased with the timing of our flights both going and returning. I pre-booked our seats and was amazed that I was not charged for doing so as most airlines do charge for this service. Check in at both airports was really easy and prompt no long queues at either end although the auto system did not work for us in Heathrow it worked well in LA but we had staff member who helped as through the process. Flight attendants were good however on our return trip the person sitting behind me kept pushing into the back of my seat not a little but a lot so I politely asked the attendant to remind him of the need to be aware of his impact on my comfort. Both my partner and I were shocked at her response, she made excuses for him and implied I should just put up with it. I had to insist she said something as it was an 11 hour flight and we were only 30 minutes in and I had suffered enough. Begrudgingly she spoke to him and after that there was only the occasional impact. All in all the flights were good and we made up time on the return due to tail winds. Would we use them again; yes we would."
Feb 2020,40,Efficient,"After arriving from an international flight, it was nice to have United ready to take my luggage and get on flight to Omaha. The ease of transition was comforting after many miles in the air."
Feb 2020,40,Short flight from San Diego to Denver,"Once again flying out of San Diego with United - a short flight to Denver , here are the findings:  - very nice ground personnel very helpful - especially because I got to do self - check-in got some help from the very polite and discrete nonetheless very helpful since I had 3 flights connection and with 2 airlines.  - easy check-in via machine + assistance.  - flight attendants polite.  - leg room like in any economy class , bad - but in the average range. The Airbus A320 is pretty comfortable but crowded and leg room is not ideal.  - seat - decent - in the average range.  - aircraft - clean and new so nothing to complain  - departure / arrival - both on time and with a smooth flight.  Overall compared to other occasions I would say the I saw an improvement in all aspects at United - a very good flight time."
Feb 2020,40,United we stand,"Used for the first time and I would call this a “no thrills” airline that delivers. In all, we used this airline 6 times - Manchester to Newark to Auckland return. Although some flights were delayed we always landed early. There was lots of legroom and the stewards were friendly and efficient - we liked the policy of not being ageist with the staff. In flight entertainment could have been better and the food was generally good.  The UA app was excellent on giving up to date information and welcomes.  We would use this airline again."
Feb 2020,30,Good Flight,"Flight found online, good selections of flights times departing and returning. The flight its self was normal. Staff friendly, good leg room, clean.  Smaller plane so no movie, the only option which seems standard is to download the airline app.  On the return flight, there were TV screens in the seat but only one TV in each row worked."
Feb 2020,40,Helpful customer service,Unfortunately my flight was delayed leaving Eugene from 5:30 to 11 am which meant I was unable to reach my connecting flight in Denver. However before I even had to talk to an agent I got a message saying they arranged for me to take a later flight. To my disappointment the later flight did not leave until 7 pm which meant a long layover and longer travel time. I was most disappointed about not getting to see my family for another day. I called customer service and explained to them my situation. I went into it understanding I did not pay to be allowed to change my departure date. However the young gentleman on the phone helped me out tremendously changing my departing date from Sunday to Monday so I could have another day with my family. This is how you turn a bad situation good! Thank you united. You impressed me.
Feb 2020,40,Support at the very last minute,"My family and I were very late catching this flight. When we got to the airport we tried to check bags and were told that it's too late so we rushed to the curbside guys thinking that would give us a break...it didn't. They sent us to a ticket counter person. We just knew we were going to miss our flight. Instead the person was so very helpful that we were able to check our bags and head down to security. We were so late (how late were you?) that we had to literally run through the airport. I am very athletic but this just threw me for a loop. I had a 30lb backpack on with two other carryons in may hands. I was tired, exhausted, and had to use the bathroom. My son was the hero because I told him his job was to run to the gate and let them know we were right behind him. This was after they made the last announcement saying we had 2 minutes before the doors were to be locked. He made it to the gate and was my Hero! We soon trailed and able to get onto the flight. With the rush we didn't have time to properly pack and because of that I had to through away a bunch of items that should have been in the checked luggage. All in all I'd leave coconut syrup any day as opposed to being left and having to catch another flight. This was my first round trip United flight and I was very impressed. I would certainly fly with them again."
Feb 2020,40,United rerouted us due to Coronavirus - very helpful,"WE had tickets purchased on points, while we were away the coronavirus flared up. UNited announced they were rerouting passengers to avoid China. As we were flying through Shanghai we started to figure out the best way to reach UNited... FB!!  We connected through FaceBook UNited page, had a messenger conversation with the service provider who was willing to call us to get CC info to cover taxes and we were rerouted and done within an hour. Breathing easy  The airline we actually flew was ANA - excellent service!"
Feb 2020,50,Flight from O'Hare to Cancun Was Nice and Smooth,"Was pleasantly surprised with an upgrade for the outbound leg of this vacation. Service was very nice. Flight was nice and smooth, and felt like it went by quickly too. Left on time, landed on time. One really can't ask for much more than that."
Feb 2020,10,Horrible Experience! They Lost my baggage and not taking any action!,United Airlines lost my baggage on 27th of December. It has been 2 months and they are not taking any action! They also lost my Canadian friend’s baggage and they make the payment right away. Do I have to be American or Canadian to be considered? Is this company gives privilege to white people when they lost their baggage? My file number is EWR79455M. Please think twice if you are going to fly with this company!
Feb 2020,30,Bad attitude by flight attendant,"The flight attendants on my flight all had bad attitudes...The worst was when one attendant was asking for the trash...She stood at my row and repeatedly asked for my trash...When I said I am not finished yet her reply was ""fine, keep your garbage""...I am not sure how United Airlines policies work but I am positive that they do allow you to finish your drink without harassment from the crew...This was my first time flying United Airlines and maybe my last...United Airlines needs to address the attitudes of their crew members towards the customer."
Feb 2020,20,Not a good experience,"Personally not a good experience. Staff rather unfriendly, entertainment poor, food didn't taste at all, couldn't log into wifi even if wanted (probably the most expensive flight wifi offer i have ever seen).  The good things: quite clean, and comfortable (leg room)."
Feb 2020,10,Delayed Flight,"United Airlines flight in Austin,TX was delayed almost three hours and I have a connecting flight from Houston to Frankfurt, When I arrived Houston 15 minutes were left for Lufthansa gate to close, and I got to choose between my luggage and my flight. I went home without checking in my baggage ,I went home with my empty hands ,all gifts I gathered through out the year to my mom ,dad all family were sitting in a warehouse at Igloo drive near by Houston Airport waiting for me to come back and pick them.  $240 one way ticket from Austin,TX to Houston ,$ 70 is for checking in my Luggage , I paid for a service I didn't get,"
Feb 2020,50,Mr.Aaron Taylor,"The crew was very friendly and courteous, the premium plus seat was very comfortable, everything about this flight was very pleasing,will highly recommend."
Feb 2020,30,Is the plane really fixed ?,"I recently flew from Newark Liberty airport to Tampa and it was an interesting flight.  First the airline attendant announced the plane was broken and we would be delayed a half hour. Ok, no big deal, delays out of Newark are common (and this one was not weather related, which at Newark can mean it is sunny, there is one cloud in the sky or a breeze or the ever special invisible storms). A half hour goes by and the pilot comes off the plane and tells us, the fuel pumps are not working (I really want working fuel pumps), it cannot be fixed in time for our flight and they will have to get us another plane. We are delayed indefinitely at this point. Then after another half hour or so the pilot comes back out and now says the plane is fixed and we will be leaving in a half hour. The passengers are all looking at each other and thinking (or saying), the idea of a new plane sounded really good. Anyway the pilot also tells us there is a storm front along the east coast and it will be very bumpy taking off and landing and we should avail ourselves of the rest rooms before we board, because the fasten seat belt signs will be on for much of the flight. Suffice to say I appreciated the communication from the pilot, although a bit of reassurance about them fixing the plane which he earlier said could not be fixed would have been comforting. Long story short, they gave us some unhealthy snacks, we did board, the ride was not too bumpy and we arrived safe and sound about an hour and a half later then scheduled. I have had better and worse experiences on United."
Feb 2020,30,First Class ios NO CLASS,"United Airlines catering service has absolutely no imagination for First Class food. Every flight has pigeon sized chicken breasts that are probably boiled forst and then quickly placed on a grill surface so they can call it ""Grilled Chicken. The ""chicken has no flavor, so they load it up with some kind of spicy styff. If you either don't like spicy or can not eat spicy food, you are out of luck. I guess you have to order a special meal when you book youf flight or bring something on board from an over priced fast food vendor past Security."
Feb 2020,40,very good TPE > SFO flight,"If you can afford (or upgrade to) United Polaris service, this is the way to fly between TPE and SFO. First off, at TPE you are entitled to visit the Eva Air Infinity Lounge pre-flight - a very nice airport lounge.    The flight itself is sped up by the same-direction jet stream, so a 14+ hours flight from SFO to TPE becomes just a 12 hour flight going from TPE back to SFO.    The United Polaris section has the individual premium sleeper private units - excellent privacy and comfort, along with gel pillow and Saks Fifth Avenue comforter. Meals are tasty, along with their signature ice cream sundae & desserts tray. Full library of lots of movies to while away the time.    When you land at SFO you are also entitled to visit the SFO Polaris Lounge - truly the best of all airport lounges. I always enjoy this flight."
Feb 2020,40,"It's a bird, it's a plane. it's ... a plane","Pay the 30 extra dollars to upgrade to Premium Economy, it's worth it in free snacks, guaranteed overhead space, and slightly larger seats."
Feb 2020,50,Always great service,I love united Airlines. The crew are always so pleasant and helpful.  United is the only airline my family uses.
Feb 2020,50,On-time comfortable flight,"United's Polaris service on their dreamliner is very comfortable. The service is efficient, the flight attendants are professional, and the flight was on time."
Feb 2020,50,"Very enjoyable flight, good, pleasant service.",Clean aircraft; professional service with smiles. Flight arrived early. Captain kept us updated on flight plan.
Feb 2020,50,Trip,Excellent service. It did upset me to pay 30 for one bag. I am disabled and was treated with tender loving care. Impeccable care . Ty United employees for not looking down or judging me nice job
Feb 2020,50,Good way to travel,Excellent leg room and attentive service round trip. Provided great movies and snacks  during the entire flight. Prices were competitive with other airlines.
Feb 2020,50,Wonderful and comfortable!,United was absolutely fantastic. I flew economy and it was quite good. There was plenty of leg room and the in-flight entertainment was excellent. Everything was working smoothly. Even the food was good. I had just recovered from a surgery and the flight attendants were very sympathetic and helped me every step of the way.
Feb 2020,20,Trip to Quebec,The flight to Quebec was fine. But Flight returning back was a mess.  To start they were done fueling up plane and we were ready to board which now was running 1/2 an hour late and they realized they didn't take on enough fuel. Which put us another 45 minutes late.  We had a connection flight to make in NJ. which of course we didn't make.  I had left 1 hr and 45 minutes for our next flight. Very disappointed in United and will try not to fly on United unless I have no choose. Had to wait in NJ for over 5 hrs. to catch the next flight.
Feb 2020,50,united,got to aruba about 1/2 early which was great would tell anybody united is a great airline  got to Newark early as well great trip
Feb 2020,40,Surprisingly comfortable and efficient,"As the plane Boeing 737-400 was full, I was expecting a cramped, uncomfortable and unfriendly 3.5 hours flight. This was not so,the sears in economy were big enough for me to be seated comfortably. The staff were friendly and welcoming and at times anticipated your needs. United seem to be on a digital innovation drive to improve customer experience and I say they are making good progress to achieving this.  Only downside are the airport security queues are too long and onerous, but I accept it as a needed precaurion."
Feb 2020,40,"I’m normally partial to AA, but I have to say… United put up a good game","I used the online app to secure my boarding passes up to 24 hours in advance. They uploaded them electronically in the app, and then gave me the option to put them in my Apple Wallet. This feature made the process of checking so simple. I went straight to the TSA check in line, opened my Apple Wallet, and placed my phone on the electronic scanner. Then showed them my photo ID. Traveling with 2 small children-6 & 8 this saved me 20-30 minutes of standing in line checking baggage.  Now I understand some of you may have a large suitcases that has to be stowed, but you should consider UA has a generous carry on baggage program.  The seats were comfortable. There was ample room to put a second carry on under the seat in front of us, giving the girls access to their snacks, drinks, toys and electronics.  My least like feature was the fact, my son told me there would be in house movies, on screens in back of the seats in front of us. This was the main reason we chose UA, to keep the girls entertained on their first long flight."
Feb 2020,50,2nd to none service!,"After flying so many airlines, I cannot explain how refreshing it was to fly with United Airlines. They treat you as a guest, not another paycheck. They don't charge you for everything you breathe on and are always there for whatever you need. We even got drinks, snacks, and a sandwich!!"
Feb 2020,30,"Seats small, uninterested attendants, fuel smell taxiing","Not a lot of room in the economy seats, the flight attendants were lackluster/uninterested, there was a strong fuel/exhaust smell while taxiing."
Feb 2020,50,A very nice flight,"Okay, I was in business class but this was a wonderful flight. Courteous flight attendants who seemed happy to be there and serve me. Can I get you more wine? Would you like some warm almonds? There are more snacks and fresh fruit in the galley if you want to wander up anytime. An awesome asks fifth avenue pillow plus another one of those memory foam ones, a blanket and a duvet just in case. The lady in front of me dropped her earring in between the seats twice and attendants happily fished it out (with some difficulty the second time). Left on time Rrived on time. Totally happy. Oh, and too many movies to choose from, seriously there was more tan one hundred."
Feb 2020,20,Disappointed,"Hawaiian Air booked us on United for our return from Kauai. After a wonderful experience on the Hawaiian flight to the island the United flight was set up for disappointment. Seats were much less comfortable, food was poor and there was a charge compared to Hawaiian."
Feb 2020,40,Bare Bones United,"It used to be Spirit & Frontier offered ""bare bones"" prices. United is on the way to becoming a glorified Spirit Airline. United, like so many others, now nickel and dimes you with all the extras which used to be included. On Basic Economy which might offer a good basic price, you now pay for ""options,"" like choosing your seat. If you don't pay, you get a middle seat at the rear of the plane. An Aisle seat is more than middle.Front of the plane more than rear. Exit seat with more legroom is even more.You pay extra to board first.You can no longer bring on a carry on. If so, you must pay. Otherwise, you must check it for $30. Any little perk that you once were lucky enough to snag, you now pay for.Pretty soon you'll have to pay to use the bathroom. All things considered, my flight was somewhat comfortable and we had a safe and uneventful flight, United is on par with most other airlines, except Jet Blue and South West, which are both much better"
Feb 2020,50,Good,We have been having good luck recently. With the way the seats recline I wish all the airlines would prohibit any recline. Without warning my laptop screen was almost destroyed by the 2 inch recline.
Feb 2020,50,Trips for medical care,I have a disability so traveling is very difficult for me. They go out of their way to make it as easy for me as they can.
Feb 2020,50,Flight for Medical care,I have a very unique situation with my disability.  United staff have gone out of their way to ensure my flight goes smoothly. They arrange wheelchairs and treat me with the upmost respect/ care.
Feb 2020,40,The worst experience but the best crew!!!,"I can’t believe that a situation this bad was turned around so beautifully by two crew members on the plane. I cant remember their names but I wish I wrote them down. They excelled at their profession and made the airline look good when they should have looked terrible. After being rebooked for the following day, reschedule again for later departure and having no food on board this two crew members delighted us with their service. I am still going to recover my fee from traveling first class with no food or drink on board as the airline somehow wasn’t able to provide that for us. But as the service is concerned this was an outstanding one! Great job picking great employees."
Feb 2020,10,"Terrible, horrible airline.","United lost my service for ever! Worst day of travel ever. To make up for it, they offered a $50 coupon off a future flight. Why in holy hell would I ever fly with them again? So the $50 is worthless. Do not fly this horrific airline."
Feb 2020,10,United doesn’t take responsibility,"United charges for luggage, and when they break the handle on your brand new ski case, they don’t replace it. Why am I giving United money to break my stuff. Fly Southwest instead if you can. Less expensive, better service, and the won’t make you pay them money so they can destroy what you own."
Feb 2020,30,Ok,I felt like a third class traveler because I could not check in until somebody first looked at my bag to make sure that was not oversized for carry on.
Feb 2020,40,Premium Economy,The dreaded long distance flight is manageable when flying in Premium Economy class due to its seat pitch and better service.
Feb 2020,20,Very uncomfortable for short people,"The headrest should be adjustable to fit different people. I'm 5'2"" and my head was pushed forward for 5 hours. My neck and shoulders were so sore by the time we landed. Even if that headrest was removable that would have been better, not everyone is 6' tall."
Feb 2020,50,very good service and always has been.,"I have used this airline before, I enjoy the service and people. It was easy to find, It was a comfortable flight"
Feb 2020,50,Major improvement in customer service!,"Could this be an effect of the recent ratings of the all the domestic airlines I wonder? Now there are choices of little munchies. Free entertainment, wow! Pleasantness of the flight crew was at an all time high.    Have been flying with them in and out of Houston over the last 25 years, several times a year and it's nice to see a positive change."
Feb 2020,50,Guatemala trip,The flight to Guatemala City went pretty smoothly and the return was just the same. You only receive a refreshemt unless you want to buy the boxed breakfast or lunch. The boxes don't look appetizing. Flight attendants were friendly and focusing on their work.
Feb 2020,40,Good flight but poor ground experience at Newark,"We had a good flight from Antigua to Newark and landed 35 minutes early. Then we sat on the ground for a long time waiting for a 787 to move out from the gate and then long again because the ground crew did not come to guide us in. Finally we were moved to the adjacent gate (which was empty the whole time we were waiting!) to deplane. So instead of arriving early, we were about 20 minutes late."
Feb 2020,40,LOONG flight,"I was dreading the thought of a (combined ) 18 hour flight back across time zones We left on a Tuesday at 2 pm and got home that same Tuesday before noon so there was very little time that it was actually dark outside. Nevertheless. we were fed regularly, well hydrated and the entertainment options were nearly limitless with seatback tv and movies, and WiFi to use personal electronics for games. It was not a full flight so they let my husband and me move to an empty three person row (although that may have had something to do with my husband helping a flight attendant with a heavy and badly stowed suitcase). This extra seat somewhat alleviated the issue of legroom as we could find different ways to arrange ourselves and out belongings."
Feb 2020,30,"Their planes aren't comfortable, but custom service is excellent.","I had some problems with this airline like missing flight due to bad weather and such, and they always tried to fix my problems. Once even changed my flight because the Chicago airport was closed, so they made my flight via Miami so I could make it to my connection. The seats aren't comfortable tho, they're a bit rough and bad position, but I rather have bad seats and good service than great seats and unfriendly staff."
Feb 2020,40,One of the better flight experinces,"All in all I was very impressed. The seats are comfy and the staff are fine. The leg room is better than I’ve experienced. The entertainment was very good with a huge selection. The food was shocking (even by plane standards). The beer was decent.  A criticism is the weird economy and the premium economy rules. If you’re in the middle section you’re economy. If you’re on the outside you’re premium economy. The difference is apparently an inch or so of leg room. At a hefty price hike. That’s it. Same cabin, same seats, same everything. With a tiny bit of extra room.  My flight outbound was nearly empty. Everyone wanted to move but nobody was allowed due to the extra charge for these barely better seats. So we were all crammed into the middle section while the other seats sat empty. In the middle of the night I ended up just moving so I could lay down. I wasn’t benefiting from the leg room as I was stretched across the seats. Nobody even noticed or said anything.  On the way back to the US an old couple just upped and moved and weren’t challenged. I don’t think they knew as the seats are so similar.    Check in was the simplest I’ve ever done. No weird questions as to where I’d been in my own country like I got from American last time I was home.    This is a good airline with good perks (I got a stupidly cheap price due to a family member’s air miles). I’d use them again and I was impressed. But don’t bother paying more for this premium economy seats! It really isn’t worth it!"
Feb 2020,30,So-so flight with crying toddlers all around,"We started out our journey in Chicago, for some unknown reason we couldn't use online check-in, as we usually do, so we ended up using the kiosks at the airport. We got our boarding passes, dropped off our bags and were on our way. Our flight was on-time, boarding was pretty good but overhead space filled up quickly, especially when you have passengers that need to use the entire bin to store their coat. I'm always fascinated how travelers have no clue how to use overhead bins, most overhead bins are made so your carry-on can fit right in, you don't have to put it sideways and only fit one bag per bin. We were on an older 767 which has seen better days. The flight crew was always smiling and ready to assist any of the travelers. In-flight service was edible but nothing to brag about. Dinner consisted of chicken and rice, with a salad and bread roll. Near the end of the flight, we had breakfast, a croissant, and yogurt. Inflight beverages include free beer as well as wine by the glass. It would be nice if United used less plastic utensils to be a little more eco-friendly. With all that being said our flight was pretty good.    Now for the bad, we probably had the worst luck on this flight with our seats. We were in economy plus but there were three toddlers under the age of 1, within arms distance. When one started crying, they all started crying and parents then standing in the aisle bouncing around with the kid so they fall asleep. It felt like being in daycare.    Our flight to Brussels was 8hrs, we even arrived 10min early, which helped us out since we had only a 50min connection between our flights. If you are connecting to a Schengen country you will need to go to terminal A, where your passport will be checked.    If you found this helpful feel free to hit the Helpful button below. Happy Travels."
Feb 2020,10,Cancellations with no reason given and no other airlines cancelled,"For two days straight we have had our flight cancelled the night before. No other airlines have had cancellations and we have paid for other accommodation in San Francisco and then we were heading to Napa and now again we will probably miss a whole day there. There total lack of care, warning and follow up for their customer is evidently showing.    Their customer relations has put us off ever flying with them again. PLEASE AVOID THEM TO AVOID DISAPPOINTMENT AND MISSING PART OF YOUR HOLIDAYS.    First rant online..."
Feb 2020,10,Use another airline,"I have been charged $300 to check in a bag that I already paid £65 to check in before I left London. The staff at Newark were rude and not interested in what I had to say, despite showing them the paid invoice from my travel agent for the checked bag.  I will avoid them at all costs. I might as well have paid for an upgrade rather than being bent over at the check in desk like I was by a member of staff who clearly has never had an customer service training.  Avoid wherever possible!"
Feb 2020,10,None,Worst experience. Flight late. Then boarded just to have us sit for over an hr. due to a broken part. Then they say its cancelled because of weather and ice in San Fran!!! Lies!!!! Hahahaha its 68 deg there. So they de board....but wait! They announce that their dispatch was wrong and alas there isnt ice in San Fran. So they re board...now it's been 45 min and they are still fixing the broken plane. Cuz that's really the issue here. It's broken and they are running machines and all this grinding is happening. And they tried to cover it up with weather issues so they wouldn't have to compensate the passengers. Now our 45 min flight is over 2 hrs.
Feb 2020,40,Excellent flight Houston to Mexico City,Excellent quick flight to Mexico City in business. Food and service very good. Seats comfortable and the wine good. No turbulence. Highly recommend it. Arrived early and bags came out quickly.
Feb 2020,40,Great early morning First Class flight to Houston,"Great flight Dulles Washington to Houston. Flight left a little late but arrived a little early. Good movie to watch, great breakfast (actually one of the best in last few years). Flight was smooth with only a few bumps along the way. Best of all connecting flight only a few gates away."
Feb 2020,40,Luggage Snuck Off to Amsterdam without Us!,"Well, I've rarely had anything other than flight delays and always had good service on United. This time, however, it was disconcerting to have a check-in kiosk go down at the end of our transaction as we were waiting for the bag tag. We started over on another machine, but I told the attendant that it had shut down. He opened up the machine, saw a bag tag, and said ""This should work just fine!"" He handed it to us and we never thought to confirm it was the right tag. The attendant where you drop the bag also did not check that the bag was going to the same destination as we were. Bag delivered three days later to our house at 12:15am with a ring at the doorbell, no notification that we might want to know they were coming. Lesson learned - always check ALL of your documents and don't leave it to others. To be fair, the United service people we spoke with were always great and gave us the info we needed. It's just that none of the protocols, written or spoken, that they said would happen did. When I wrote in to let them know how the whole process went, I suggested they give my husband and I each the miles for our bag going without us. They did credit 10K miles to my account at least."
Feb 2020,50,Great flight,"The flight left on time and actually arrived a little early. The food was good and the air crew very attentive. The flight was smooth and uneventful, and our luggage came quickly."
Feb 2020,10,"Terrible, wouldn't recommend especially for families.","My mother and I were traveling to a softball tournament together. When we bought our tickets we weren't informed at all that we weren't allowed to have a carry on bag, so we had to pay 120 dollars extra just to check in 2 very small, carry on sized bags. When we finally got on our first flight the overhead bins were virtually empty, just another way to price gauge your money for no reason. On our second flight home we were informed that we weren't allowed to sit together because economy fliers have no seating priorities, this was an issue because I'm sixteen and considering a minor, which means if you are flying with a minor you are not obligated the privilege of sitting close to your child, which is what the lady told us when we tried to check in. So if you are flying with kids it would be safer to fly with another airline. Overall this was the worst flight experience my mother and I have ever experienced and we wouldn't recommend for anyone."
Feb 2020,40,It's a way to get from one place to another,"What can you say about today's airlines? You suck it up and fly. Sure, the flight staff are pleasant and the captain keeps you informed, but it's impossible not to feel like you're just another sardine in the can... and I'm 4'10"" tall so I can't imagine how taller and heftier people feel!"
Feb 2020,40,Early arrival but the gate was not ready,"This is a direct flight from Columbus Ohio to Phoenix AZ. We had tail wind and unusual early arrive, about 45 minutes. Because of that we had to wait the gate is available. Ended up it was 15-20 minutes late arrival. It was not United fault, and the captain informed us well."
Feb 2020,50,Great service,It was a commuter flight and my wife and I had had a horrendous time making connections in Houston. When we got on the flight we were both annoyed and exhausted. Our flight attendant was Serena who was so bouncy and cheerful that she really improved our death disposition. You could see that she was a very high to serve all of us within a short period of time and doing so in such a friendly and personable manner. Good job United.
Feb 2020,50,Outstanding service,And reviews I see a lot of criticisms of services on American Airlines but the service that my wife of 53 years and I had on February 9 was very good. Both Cabin attendants were efficient and very friendly. We were both very pleased with how we were treated and will certainly pick United airlines again with no hesitation.    In boarding in Panama City we had to go through security twice which was kind of a pain but this was not the fault of the airline.
Feb 2020,30,Good flight,"When we were coming to Denver, we ended up being several hours late, due to the white-out weather. The weather on our return trip was not nearly as bad, so we were only 32 minutes late taking off and about 38 minutes late on our arrival. The weather in Chicago was less than desirable. We were on a Boeing 757-300 (twin-jet) (B753), which was comfortable. The flight was relatively smooth. The air crew was efficient and friendly."
Feb 2020,10,I gave one star only because I can not give 0 stars on a review,"Most terrible experience ever. almost 6 hours of total delay. And eventually, baggages stayed in Nj and had to wait almost 2 days to get my luggages.  I had overweight, made me pay 100$ for any overweight amount, AND THEN they told me you have to still remove stuff because paying 100$ gives you certain amount of additional pounds. They lied and even there ""manager"" refused to even talk to the employee that lied to me. All of them were very rude and especially the manager that was super rude and inhuman and she was almost yelling! It was the worst experience in my life.  Multiple other travelers arrived with no luggages as well and they had to fill forms to be contacted when their luggages arrive, just as I did."
Feb 2020,30,United Airlines didnt come with their A game.,"this flight appears to be full every time. with the smaller jet, it was cramped. Actual flight itself was excellent as the pilot and crew were consummate professionals."
Feb 2020,50,Smooth Flight to Colorado Springs,"TSA in Omaha didn't confiscate my mouth wash due to size but it was caught in Denver. Omaha TSA had chains across the metal detector so I went through the manual scanning device. The agents wanted to know if I had a medical condition requiring me to get a manual scan. Since I didn't, I was directed to go back through the metal detector. Since the chains were in place I thought the detector was not in service. TSA didn't seem to have their act together. We had a 30 minute delay in Omaha for deicing which caused us to really rush in Denver to catch the connecting flight. We had to go from B Concourse to A Concourse but they waited for us. This was an Airbus plane. Normally, ""If it ain't Boeing, I ain't going"" but I didn't have a choice this time."
Feb 2020,40,Annual Trip,Not much interaction with the flight crew. Offer water several times and snacks and that was about all. Very interesting
Feb 2020,40,UA 83 flight review,I flew United airlines from New Delhi to Newark  Everything was exceptional from airport checkin to security to in flight service  The food was fine There was excellent service from International Service Manager and all  Exceptional Service from attendant Dimple. Very caring and nice  The ground staff at Delhi airport was truly wonderful  Mohit and Jaideeo made the difference  Highly recommend this
Feb 2020,40,"flight great, lounge a disappointment","we had an excellent flight attendant on the almost-12-hour flight - no japanese meal available by the time they got to us, but we knew we'd be eating lots of delicious japanese food in-country - got a solid 5-6 hours sleep even on a daylight flight, so we arrived feeling pretty good  the SFO lounge, which had received such great reviews? not so wonderful after all - the dining room seems to have shrunk their menu, so we didn't even bother - showers were OK but no bath mat or toiletries (there was a basket by the sink. but it only held a sharps container), temps only show in Fahrenheit  no newspapers or magazines in lounge or on the flight - i guess they figure everyone reads on their devices now  overall a very good experience once we boarded"
Feb 2020,40,Great Flight from IAD to FLL,The flight was ahead of schedule leaving the gate and also arrival in Ft Lauderdale. The Flight Attendants were active the entire flight and the middle seat in the Exit Row was left open which added to the enjoyment. The electrical in flight charging plugs actually worked!!!
Feb 2020,40,United 2 stop flight,Flight from Toronto to Houston was on time and service was great.  Flight from Houston to McAllen had technical difficulties with the aircraft. The airline kept us informed throughout the 45 minute delay. About 25 minutes after take off we had to return to Houston airport due to a cabin pressure issue. Pilot and cabin staff kept us well informed and ground staff had us boarded onto a new aircraft within 20 minutes of landing. Our arrival in McAllen was about an hour and 45 minutes late but under the circumstances United got us to our destination safe and as quickly as possible.
Feb 2020,20,Poor Maintenance Led to Multiple Delays; Premium Economy Worthless,"Poor maintenance caused the airline to move us from the plane on which we were already seated and ready to another 15 minutes away, with an hour wait for it to be ready. Delay caused hideous backup at SXM, which clearly could not cope with three arrivals at once. Took us 90 minutes to get our baggage, amid a chaotic scene. Very sorry we paid for Premium Economy, which was worthless."
Feb 2020,10,United Airlines Indifferent to Assault,"February 8th from Chicago to Memphis 4181, person in front of me was being pumped with my bags. , turned around told me to back off. When I suggested she must not be very well-traveled because that's normal. She shoved me. Staff was indifferent. Did not believe me. Finally and eyewitness confirmed. Was with my disabled mother. I asked to be moved. They were going to put me in seat number for with my mom and I asked for a first class. Attendant was courteous there I had been demanding. That that person be removed from the plane. I was treated like a troublemaker. I insisted on first class for my mother. She literally put her hands on me and shoved me. And made odd paranoid comments. Some people may have shoved her back. She said I started it as if we were both five years old. I tried to just get away from the situation while getting her off the plane because that is totally not normal, and she was unstable. I could have involved the Chicago, police but asked for the TSA Who acted like we were both at fault? When there was only one person at fault, and that is the person that assaulted me. All the while my 75 year-old mother had to suffer. Unbelievable."
Feb 2020,40,Everything went well,We had a connecting flight in Denver. Both flights were on time and everything went smoothly. We safely and on time.and our luggage arrived
Feb 2020,20,Not Impressed,"We flew United airlines as part of a complete trip booked through Air Canada. They used United as their United States partner. Watch out for this! United doesn't allow seat changes at any time without a large fee. One flight was late due to mechanical issues of not being able to hook up the bridge to deplane, so we missed our connection. Trying to find any United Airlines staff to rebook us on another flight was impossible. No one was at the Customer Service except other angry travellers. After my husband roamed the airport to find someone, we were rebooked through different cities and finally arrived at our destination after 15 hours of travel time. There is no entertainment center as we have on Air Canada. Being the last seats on the plane meant we got to sit for hours in the last seats,smelling the washroom and freezing because the air from the flush toilet was wafting up between the seats. What a nightmare. United does not have direct flights to most cities. Next time I'll try American airlines as they have the advantage of direct flights"
Feb 2020,40,great customer service for gold members,"the premium plus seats row 22-24 are just exceptional. you get a cute little baggie of goodies, amazing headphones, better food, access to liquor and a roomier seat. it's definitely worth the upgrade when it's around 500 usd. sometimes you can get it free with the complimentary upgrade as gold status.. it also gets you through the priority check in lines at the airport so your bag comes out sooner and it's just overall an easier experience."
Feb 2020,40,Good Flight,"United provides good service and mostly on time. The United Express planes, while not spacious, are comfortable."
Feb 2020,10,Ms marilyn jensen,"UA cancelled outbound flite 6am if day I was to depart at noon. Could not travel to next day. They said it was weather in Denver, but Den airport weather was fine.Had to call hotel in Bcn and try to explain in Spanish. Had paid $67 + $169 for seats on outbound. The refunded $67 only and no sign of $200 voucher they promised. Really was the worst in customer service."
Feb 2020,10,Person at check in don’t check in people,Third time found ourselves in check in line and representatives don’t want to help. Just shaking they heads. Fk United
Feb 2020,40,United has upped their game.,"The flight crew was much more accomodating than the previous flights we have had in the past. We even landed early by about 10 minutes. From when we left the plane, walked to the mobile lounge (bus), went through customs and our bags were on the carousel, and snagged a taxi - it took 1 hour. That's pretty fast for Dulles. In-flight entertainment has improved - they offered a better selection of movies and the meal service was the standard fair. A flight should be eventless, cater to the passengers needs and get people where they need to go quickly. This service accomplished those 3 things."
Feb 2020,40,Love the APP,"Not a frequent UA flyer. Reservation took me thru Denver which can overwhelm me. The APP and wonderful notifications inform and update you all the way. An example I really appreciated was I was informed my arrival gate, my departure flight gate and how many minutes it will take to walk there! Boarding updates are also sent. All the flight went well going and coming even with snow along the way."
Feb 2020,30,Direct flights pretty much limited to weekends,Not bad not great. Nothing to write home about. On time arrived early. What a expect for the type of flight. The good news is that Grand Cayman has updated and up grade their airport.
Feb 2020,20,Cattle Treatment,"THE worst thing about our trip to New Orleans was the airline experience. The TSA introduction is of course unavoidable, but it sets the stage for the de-humanizing experience in boarding the airplane last, with but one small carry-on, and being crammed into sardine seats at the back of the airplane, and even being forced to pay for those seats! Ohh, we could have paid more for better seating, but then we might have not even gone on the trip in the first place.    Having said all these negative things, United got us to Houston on time, and then to New Orleans on time as well.    I guess my complaint isn’t so much a United Airlines complaint but is an airlines travel complaint, though United could eliminate sardines seating, it seems to me, if they value their economy customers just a little."
Feb 2020,10,"Just walk, at least you won't have your time/money stolen by a big corporation.","I've talked to too many people with the same experience.    Stole my time and my money. A day of my time so big corporate can maximize its profits. (a whole plane full of people time)  Wasn't worth it to them so they canceled my flight IMO. Others say they are known for this and then claim weather. (all other flights arrived that day,,Hmmm?)    A lot of other issues with them and their staff as well. (guess a friendly (still smiling) customer wasnt enough for their entitled chip on the shoulder personnel)    Donating my miles to someone. Done    United is like one of those neighborhoods that ""nothing good comes out of going there"""
Feb 2020,40,Can't escape the weather!,"Little did I know that when I woke up on a nice, sunny morning, I would be delayed, but it is the Midwest and you just never know with the weather. Getting through TSA and the pre-check went quickly and was completely uneventful. I only had one carry-on, so I didn't have to worry about luggage when we arrived in Denver. We were flying a Boeing 737-800 (twin-jet) (B738). We boarded about 1025 hrs., right on schedule, then the bad news. Denver was at a complete white-out. Twice we were able to get off of the plane and waited for the announcement to reboard. We ended up taking off 3 hrs. and 32 minutes late. Considering that we were supposed to arrive at 1313 hrs., we landed after being cleared for the flight, only 3 hrs. and 41 minutes late at 1654 hrs. So, why four bubbles - because we were able to get off the plane, which did make the time go faster and was a lot more comfortable. The flight crew was efficient and perosnable."
Feb 2020,30,"Economy class too much ""cost save""","In comparison of various airlines I would place United somewhere in the ""mid field"" as for the combined experience. It's certainly much more ""low cost airline"" in Economy these days than before. I have all the respect for the difficult balance act of pleasing passengers vs ticket price but how come United have gone so much further than e.g. Lufthansa in the use of really cheap plastic forks etc? Is it even the right choice these days? To me United is almost like a ""flag carrier"" internationally but I'm a bit reluctant as for next booking. I like the staff, the overall touch and feel but why this almost Ryan Air experience?"
Feb 2020,10,I would drive next time if I could!,"How can you not anticipate snow and ice in Montana in Feb.? Takeoff delayed an hour because of waiting to de-ice the plane. Because apparently, according to the pilot, they had to ‘borrow’ a de-icing truck from Delta, and had to wait until they finished taking care of their own planes. Mind you, it was only an inch of snow on the ground, so I have to assume this was mild weather for Montana in February. Needless to say, the 1 hour delay had everyone on the plane running to make connecting flights once landing in Denver."
Feb 2020,40,Improved International Service,"Very good flight on a 777. Pitch sufficient to sleep; the ambient noise comfortable; service at regular intervals throughout, including water. Flight attendants were courteous and hard-working."
Feb 2020,10,Appalling,We have first class tickets and these don't give access to the lounge. We have a 6 hr wait for the flight to Montrose after flying from Australia. Very annoyed as we booked first class especially to be able to use the lounge. Appalling !!!
Feb 2020,40,First flight out of Logan,"I took the direct 6:00 am flight out of Logan, to maximize my time in SF. I made it to SF in under 6 hours, then still had a whole day in the city. I chose an aisle seat, to be able to get up and stretch when necessary. The aisle seats do have a little less storage space under the seat in front of you, but I was able to store my regular sized backpack without any issue. The flight crew was friendly and efficient. I will take this flight again when it's available - it was my best flying experience to CA."
Feb 2020,20,Why paying for seats if you get them for free,We bought premium seats up front.  After boarding a Dutch couple complaint and felt sick ( so they said) they were move up to seats next to us.  She was so xxxxl hardly fitted in bulkheadseat but I overheard them saying “ so we did it again” free seats.  I got upset after the flight and complaint to UA and requesting refund. All they did was giving 2500 miles as a compensation.  We fly 2-3 times to USA yearly. Not on UA again
Feb 2020,50,Ease of Entry,"The right time of day. Uncrowded flight. Sufficient leg room and decent food served by friendly staff. The movie choices were good and the entertainment system is easy to use on such a long flight. Dulles is so much cleaner and more organized than JFK. Passport Control was quick, no long lines."
Feb 2020,10,Bad speaking with manager no answer,No costumer service even to speak with manager I don’t get right answer and they charge me extra money that’s too tough service
Feb 2020,10,I'll try another airline next time,"I used united airline for my business travel too Atlanta total of 4 plans over the week. Had decent trips to Atlanta but coming back got stuck on a delay which was not great but manageable, what isn't is when getting on the plan they state group 8 and 9 will have to check baggage but the woman stops me at group 4 and has me check my baggage. Now I'm arriving at 1 am instead of 8pm and not that im here I'm waiting 30 minutes for my baggage to circle around and I have to work in 5 hours. I have used delta prior too and they weren't great by any means but on the one occasion they forced me to check a bag they had at the gate for me atleast."
Feb 2020,40,Good flights,Goo flights with comfy seats. Small snack offered which was adequate as only a short flight. Staff were friendly and helpful.
Feb 2020,10,There wasn’t a zero!,"I would have rated them as a zero but couldn’t because it wasn’t an option. I have never observed such an extremely poor managed operation. There are some weather delays, when traveling from ND in the winter time, very expected. What’s not expected is that they don’t change the reader boards. Poor announcements, poor service, poor everything. Typical company who doesn’t understand customer service."
Feb 2020,20,Worst flight to dated; Need to upgrade planes,"Seating - no leg room; hard uncomfortable seats  Snacks - child size portions  No WIFI unless you paid for it - paid enough for flight should have been free  Flight from Antigua to Newak was relatively smooth - to be expected  Flight from Newak to Burlington - scary as heck.... bad weather in Burlington prevented us from landing... Pilot shared with already scared passenger do to horrible turbulence ""have about an hour's worth of fuel left - if we can't land shortly we will need to return to Newark.... which we did.... landed back in Newark and Pilot shared ""not sure we will try to fly back to Burlington, VT tonight we need to check plane as it may have been damaged when trying to land in Burlington"".... spent night in Airport... Ugh.. United rep share United to provide hotel voucher if anyone wanted it is now 1:30 AM you will need to be back at the airport at 4:00 AM -now that makes sense.... Rep shared we needed to pick up checked luggage and re-check it in the AM... so we did only to find out that after we left to do this... rep shared with those few remaining they did not need to pick up their checked luggage United would be sure it got on the next plane... then proceed to give food vouchers to those few who were still there..... Poor Customer Serivce. - While I don't hold togUnited accountable for the bad weather in VT I do hold them accountable for leaving Newark in the first place... should have cancelled flight. Future trips will not included United Airlines"
Feb 2020,20,Carry on luggage disater,"Airline has a carry on policy but seems to ignore it. Passengers bring check i size bags then stuff them in overhead allowing no room for other people. We sat for 21/2 hours with correct size carry on at feet, no way to stretch out. Very disappointed."
Feb 2020,10,Worst flight experience in my life,"My group was flying to Iceland for my sister's birthday. The entire trip had been planned so that we would be relaxing in the Blue Lagoon on her actual birthday.    So when our flight to Frankfurt was delayed, delayed, and then after more hours of delay, canceled, we were somewhat upset. But as frequenters travelers, we understood that sometimes things can go wrong (in this case, a fuel leak). United provided us with a nice hotel and meal vouchers and we tried to make the best of things.    Then our flight the next day was delayed and delayed (mechanical issue again). It was delayed about 4-5 hours in the end. We still thought we had a chance to make our final flight to Reykjavik and we RAN to the gate (arriving in the nick of time), only to find that United had failed to supply tickets for the flight they told us we were on. We ran back to the United counter, got tickets, and ran back to the flight, only to find that though they had told us we were on this flight and printed tickets for said flight, they had actually booked us for the next flight - 8 hours later. My sister literally started crying. United gave us more meal vouchers. We finally did make it into Reykjavik that night, 10 minutes to midnight on my sister's birthday.    Because of how we were rebooked, United's system only acknowledged the screw up with the first flight and neither of the subsequent flights. All of the United people we talked to were very nice, but not very helpful.    Another EXTREME FRUSTRATION was that all 4 of use had booked our tickets separately, which meant that although we called and asked for our tickets to be linked, EVERY SINGLE FLIGHT we were asking them to try and regroup our seats together (they never could, even after delaying our trip 2 days it was 'sorry, you are subhuman and don't get the honor of picking your seats').  I'm pretty sure the only reason we made it home at the end of the trip was that we were on a flight with Lufthansa.    I am NEVER flying internationally with United again. At least, not if I actually care about reaching my destination."
Feb 2020,10,Pretty much a negative experience everytime,"Nothing ever goes right. Their employees are always unhappy and are not being paid well. When employees are unhappy, they take it out on their customers or try their best to hide it. Often you see them hiding it.    Always delays. Always a wrinkled face from attendants.    When I lost my baggage, they bounced me around with attitude.    Stewardess always fake happiness.    What's worse? United breaks guitars."
Feb 2020,50,My preferred means of getting to Belize,"I've been flying to Belize every 2 to 3 months and I've always flown with United, not always First Class as it all depends on seat sales and availability. But no matter what class of ticket I have always had an excellent flight. Very few delays. I was delayed a couple years ago on my return due to the Hurricane that hit Houston, within a couple days United had me rescheduled and I was heading home. I hope to continue to be able to fly with United for many more trips to Belize."
Feb 2020,20,Upgrade failure,"We are travelers that are dedicated to United Airlines, as they normally provide a great service. This time was a major screw-up. We decided to use points to upgrade to Premium Plus seats. This section and seats are very comfortable and I enjoyed some sleep. However, my wife is gluten-free and her United account is marked as ""gluten intolerant"" and has been for four years. As I received my meal, she asked about her GF meal. They had no record of this, and offered no options. On other airlines that this has happened they usually go get a first class meal and or cobble something together. And of course this happened again as we were on approach to Munich airport. No apology or anything to make amends. Maybe next time they can ""Do Better""."
Feb 2020,10,Terrible terrible onetime record,"First in Norfolk, they couldn't figure out how to count people onboard. Then mechanical issue. I had to sprint in DC in order to catch connection. Departed gate 30 min late. Another 30 min on runway as we watched 6 different United planes go around us and take off, then told we have to wait for weather?!!!"
Feb 2020,20,"Once again, hosed by United Airlines","So I’m flying from Akron, OH to SLC, UT through Houston, TX. It has been raining and freezing in Akron for 2 days now. It even snowed last night. So I arrive at the airport for a flight that is supposed to leave at 8:35 AM. The plane has been sitting in the freezing rain and snow since the night before and the ground crew in their infinite wisdom didn’t bother to check for ice until after we were supposed to board the plane. Now I’m going to miss my connection in Houston and will have to sit and wait for several hours to actually get home. The thing that makes me irate is I just got an email from United Airlines telling me my flight is late because the plane was delayed coming in which is a complete and utter lie!!! The app tells me the plane was here last night and the pilot came on and said the plane was sitting overnight too. So why does United feel the need to lie about why this flight was late? Why wouldn’t they have someone looking at the plane an hour before it is supposed to take off so everyone can keep their schedules? I work for a large transportation company and we are required to make sure all vehicles and planes are taken care of prior to actual use so as not to disrupt the transportation network. I understand issues happen but this one was completely avoidable if United would have done their job."
Feb 2020,10,Should have flown American,"Wow I always fly American and now I understand why.    This airline is devoid of any kind of customer service, you hear the horror stories and think there's no way, but now I'm convinced, this is corporate culture, customer service never even entered into the conversation.    Shame on you in United for continuously abusing the customer when they are a captive audience."
Feb 2020,40,United Star Alliance is composed of outstanding carriers,United Airlines maintains a consistent level of performance. Staff in Reservations and Flight Attendants work hard and try to please the Customer.
Feb 2020,50,Great Direct Flight,My wife and I recently flew United Airlines to Oahu. It was a non-stop flight that was supposed to take 9 hours and 45 minutes. We took off on time and arrived about 30 minutes early. We were well served while on the plane. Great landing by the captain.
Feb 2020,50,Business Class is perfect for overnight flight,"Our flights were very perfect, even using 3 different airlines. Stewards for United were the best ever had on any flight. I am disabled but had no trouble at all."
Feb 2020,50,Had to cancel my trip due to an emergency,"I had to cancel my trip due to an emergency and I did not have travel insurance. After proved the emergency with documents from the hospital and doctor, they refunded the whole amount of my tickets in just a matter of few days. Very happy about that."
Feb 2020,50,Reliable partner,Always treated well. Fight was early into Houstom. Very quick flight. Check in is painless. Needs a club in Cancun to relax in
Feb 2020,30,Normal Flight,"Normal flight from Raleigh to Quito with a stop in Houston. I had a lay over in Quito and another flight on Tame to Cuenca. The overnight in the Quito airport was very uncomfortable. They do not allow you to go the more comfortable gate area (at least on the international side) until you check in at the airline counter, but their are no agents at the counter until 2 hours before the flight. So, you are sitting in the area with access with the street until the airline agents show up."
Feb 2020,40,Mostly smooth,"Economy is not built for me so I guess I need to look at other options but check in and baggage went great. Stewardess' are great. Kind, friendly, and helpful. Couldn't understand the steward. One flight was delayed but they met us at the unload shoot with reassigned tickets and helped get us going on our next flight wonderfully. Happy camper."
Feb 2020,50,Great on time return from Vegas!!!,Actually flight was twenty minutes early and did not have to even wait for a gate to open and had outstanding service
Feb 2020,40,"Good airline, but started late and we only made our connecting flight because they were unloading our luggage.","A good airline to fly, just tricky when flying international and they are late off the ground. After waiting in the security line at Frankfurt, our connecting flight time came and went before we could make it to our connecting gate."
Feb 2020,10,Mean and Unprofessional,Mean and unprofessional at best!  Mean and unprofessional! No updates on delayed flight (sat away from gate for over an hour with no updates). Flight attendants were mean. The plane had lots of open seats and they would not let those that may miss their connection flight move closer to the front (in an open seat).
Feb 2020,10,The Website,"Be aware, if you purchase your tickets in advance, United will screw everything up. This is the third time I have had issues with the website. I book 4 to 7 months in advance for family vacations, and every time United's IT department screws it up. If you call customer service, you get different answers every time and no one can fix it. I prepaid for Eco plus and checked baggage, and now I can't change seats and it shows that I owe for baggage, United doesn't seem to care. I have found in the past, if you send a letter to the FAA, United will respond, but otherwise you will get no help. The customer service is untrained and not knowledgeable. One lady even told me that the baggage fee was for the 3rd piece of luggage, why would you prepay for the 3rd piece? I do have all my receipts, so I guess I will see what happens at the airport and with the FAA letter. I still like United for there flights, but they need to fix the IT department."
Feb 2020,40,Competitive business class,"Pros:  * Comfortable, roomy seat with decent privacy (1-2-1 configuration)  * Friendly crew  * Clean cabin  * Extra snacks in galley  Cons:  * Food was hit-and-miss (Japanese set)  * Service was hit-and-miss  * Cabin was fairly warm for half the flight and finally cooled off  Summary:  * United Polaris is a solid product overall and definitely would fly again"
Feb 2020,20,Crewless,This is the third time there has been three or more delay because there was no crew. Getting kind of old. Now add in 44 gates to next segment and 4 escalators out of service and I got my daily 2 mile walk in.
Feb 2020,10,Flight from Hell,"Got to LAX 3 hrs before flight to depart. Departure time 7:16. At 6:30 they updated the flight changeing it to 8:00 PM. At 7:30 changed it delaying another 45 minutes. 9:00 again delayed; three separate delays, then they tell us the plane is at the terminal but waiting for a crew. Crew arrives about 10:30 for the 11:08 departure. At about 11:30 it was anounced that they were waiting for the Captain; shortly after that we see the crew leaving, and they anounce that the flight was canceled until 7:45 the next day. Got luggage then shuttled to hotel. Got to bed about 1:00 am, had a 5:30am wake up call. Returned to terminal about 6:30, got on plane about 7:30. After all passengers were in their seats one of the crew anounces that there had been no safety check done on the plane and that all passengers must depart the plane during the safety check. They announced the safety check would take approximately one hour. Finally at about 8:45 we are reboarded and headed for Boise. Arrived Boise at 12:00, Tuesday. If possile I will NEVER fly United again. I understand stuff happens, the the total imcompetance of the entire United team was embarassing. Only than the loan stewardess (she was great), every United ermployee we came in contact with was encompetent. Never again, I hope....."
Feb 2020,50,vaca to playa,"Excellent as always, love flying United. Staff very friendly, check in very easy. Older plane but was still able to enjoy a movie while on board."
Feb 2020,50,"""Simple but fair price""","The flight was good, on time and no delays and the flight grew was also wonderful and the food was average. As always extra leg room is good. This was on of there older aircraft and otherwise was a good flight overall."
Feb 2020,40,Generally good,"The flights, both ways were fine. The only downside is when we arrived in Newark International. I made the mistake of flying into that airport on my return to Raleigh. Once we touched down we were held on the tarmac for over 45 minutes while ground crew were training at an active gate!  Poor planning on the part of either United or the Airport management. Just be careful of your connecting cities on your flights."
Feb 2020,50,On time most of the times,"Weekly 1K traveler from IAH to ORD. Morning flight is always fully booked, yet is on time or ahead of time 95% of the time. They also use nice Boeing 737 jets."
Feb 2020,10,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. Don’t FLY!,"My flight UA1543 1/26 (EWR to SJU) was sent back to the gate for a medical emergency last night. The gentleman sitting next to me in the middle seat was EXTREMELY massive and took up most of my aisle seat. Once we got back to the gate, we waited for over 3 hours for a new medical, which is COMPLETELY unacceptable but that’s not where the problem was. Seated in front of me were 3 flight attendants that were, I’m assuming going to SJU to work another flight? We were parked at the gate for 4 HOURS and were told they had to legally allow us to get up and the opportunity to step off the plane to stretch. I got up and walked to the front of the plane because I had to stand up and stretch my back because I was practically sitting in the aisle due to the man next to men. I went up to the flight attendants in the front of the plane (one of which being one that was seated in front of me) and VERY NICELY asked if it were possible to PLEASE potentially be moved to one of the seats that were empty in the rear of the plane. I was told, that that was a possibility once we were ready to go. Time had passed and the 3 flight attendants seated in front of me wound up taking over the flight as the new crew because we had been waiting for such a long time and the original crew took their bags off the plane and I assumed went home. The one VERY nice flight attendant approached me and told me that I could have her seat located in the exit row. I was EXTREMELY appreciative. So nice of her. That wouldn’t last very long. Shortly after settling into my new seat. I was abruptly approached by the male flight attendant and asked where my seat was because it wasn’t the one I was in. I was completely taken back. When I informed him that the other flight attendant allowed me to sit there, that wasn’t good enough. She saw him talking to me and came to see what was going on. When she verified that she allowed it, he proceeded to talk about how it was economy plus seat and that he wasn’t going to allow me to sit there because I hadn’t paid for it. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! We’ve only been patiently sitting here at the gate for 4 hours waiting for a new medical kit but we’re going to worry about me paying for a seat. ABSOLUTELY APPALLED! The flight attendant that had given me her seat (just as shocked as I was) said that he was more senior than her and that there was nothing she could do for me. I would’ve HAPPILY sat in the rear of the aircraft if it meant that I could have some comfort. Especially since I had a 2 hour drive once I arrived in PR. But let’s not worry about my safety. Let’s worry about the fact that if I wanted to sit in the exit row I had to paid extra. He was ready to pull out his credit card machine if that what i wanted to do. Instead, the gentleman seated at the window then had an entire row to him that we laid across. I didn’t see him being asked to pay for the other 2 seats! He was extremely rude and that was uncalled for. Terrible customer service. I was made to feel like I didn’t matter and I’m not at all happy with my experience. I am not at all one to complain but this was uncalled for and unnecessary. Also contacting customer service was a complete waste of time."
Feb 2020,40,Amsterdam-Chicago-St Louis,"In contrast to our flight over to Switzerland for our Rhine River cruise I didn’t rate this flight as the one over on a 767. The main flight back was on a 757 which by contrast felt more crowded and had less overhead storage. Not United’s fault but impact the flight. The other thing is while boarding we noticed people with seats  in the back of the plane were putting their luggage in the overhead bins in the Economy Plus section where we were sitting. I am told this occurs frequently because apparently they are more important and want to get off the plane quicker and don’t we have to wait to everyone passed to go to the back to get ours. I mentioned it to the flight attendant and she was like what’s the big deal. She saw them put their luggage up and walk to the rear. Not to mention we paid extra to be in Economy Plus and be in the front. Other than that the the flight and I’m flight service was very good. Just wish we would have been on the larger, more spacious 767."
Feb 2020,40,"Fair price, professional, economy seat",Departed UA777-300 from central coast California-LAX-Hawaii-Guam-Palau (25 hours with a 3 hour lay-over Hawaii).    Throughout entire flight the crews were professional and attentive.    All flight boarding was on time. Used same carrier on return. All was very good.
Feb 2020,10,Worst airline ever,"Worst airline in the sky!!!! Can’t get seats right, terrible service, never had a flight that went even slightly smooth. Would never recommend to my worst enemy. I would rather pay double the fair to fly any other airline."
Feb 2020,50,On the money!,This was my first time in years flying United Airlines and was quite impressed by the professionalism of the entire crew. The entire trip went off like clock work. Thank you
Feb 2020,50,Well worth the extra to upgrade,"Flew on the 787-10 Dreamliner. That in itself is so nice as the plane is so bright and modern. When checking in got an offer to upgrade to premium economy and took it. So glad we did, the larger seat and amenities were well worth it. I rarely sleep on planes and fact the seat pitch is better and there’s a leg support i actually slept. So arrived feeling nice and refreshed and not the usual sleep deprived feeling."
Feb 2020,50,Easy boarding and on time take off,"Great service as always, on time for both legs of the flight, service connecting through Houston (IAH)"
Feb 2020,10,Economy Plus is not worth it!,"This was a very long flight made even more so by the VERY average level of service and comfort. We upgraded to Economy Plus at some expense thinking we would would get a larger seat and more room. Sadly this is not the case, you simply get more leg room (considerably more) which would be great if you are very tall (6' +) otherwise the seat was exactly the same. More fool us as we could have researched that more. Other than that disappointment the service and offerings were very lack lustre. I wold not recommend this airline for a flight of this length. The shorter trip (Houston to Cancun) was good, this was not!"
Feb 2020,10,Sharing credit card information,"Instead of sending me my confirmation, they sent me someone else’s confirmation- with their name, flight info, and credit card info. When I called to complain they said it “probably wouldn’t happen again”. When I asked for a refund as I don’t trust united with my personal info anymore they told me the flight was non refundable.  Don’t fly United if you don’t want your information going to strangers!"
Feb 2020,40,Flight was Great BUT,We scheduled our flight from Chicago to Kona and our connecting flight was from Honolulu to Kona on Hawaiian airlines. I guess because United thought our connection time was to short they kept changing our flight to later. I had to call 4 times to get it changed back to our original connection. I will say every time call the reservation person was very helpful and changed the reservation back but it was a little ridiculous I had to do this 4 times!! On the flip side once we got on the plane everything was great and we made our connection with time to spare.
Feb 2020,10,Typical Uniited,"Took off 2:15 minutes late. No attempt to make up time in the air. I missed my connection by 10 minutes. No effort to catch up, no request that people allow those trying to make connection to leave first. No concern what-so-ever."
Feb 2020,10,It’s not like anybody at United cares!!!,After buying United first class tickets for a trip to Maui I will never fly United again. Could go on and on but no real point. I will go back to a delta and I will take my 1 million+ Marriott and Amex points back to places that are concerned for their passengers. United apparently has no Fs to give.
Feb 2020,30,Delayed departure - barely made connection,Flight delayed over an hour for maintenance problem on incoming flight but connection not held and barely made it in time. The passengers without close connections kindly let those of us who had one get off first - the first time I've seen passengers actually respond when asked to do this!
Feb 2020,40,Only way to go to and come back from San Francisco,"Interesting flight to SFO, strong Pacific storm moving across U.S., west to east. Pilots had to vector around very high, stormy ceilings and did a terrific job with minimal turbulence. We were a few minutes late, but they got us there safely!  Return trip, though bumpy, was even better, landing 21 minutes early (thank you tail wind). Flight attendants were terrific, even for a late night arrival (midnight). They went above and beyond to make my daughter comfortable and tried everything possible to get her tv monitor to work. We really appreciated their professionalism and caring attitudes."
Feb 2020,50,Good experience,"Good experience. Comfortable, clean planes and friendly staff.  I was reluctant to flight with United since I had read two bad stories involving pets. However, I travelled with them for work and I have to say the service was good and the staff was polite and professional. Whichever changes they're implementing are definitely working.    The only bad thing is that they do not have USB outlets to charge one's phones. You have to charge it before departing, which is not always feasible given the short amount of time in between transfers."
Feb 2020,10,My last resort airline,"I am a frequent flyer and hold status on two different airlines. Occasionally, United offers service to cities where I can't get other carriers to take me. I feel like about 50% of the time, when I book United, there will be a problem.    My latest was out of Aspen. To be fair, I am always prepared to be stranded here, because the weather can strand planes. I received a notice two days prior to my flight to make alternative plans due to inclement weather. I arranged for shuttle to Denver, and booked a flight with an alternative carrier. I was informed by United that I was not entitle to a voucher. I was stuck paying for a flight that was not going out. And, oh, they were very courteous about cancelling my flight, so the next sucker could pay over fare for a last minute flight that will not go out.    And...on the flight there, I had a tiny carry on. But...it had wheels on it. I was told it had to be checked. But since it was my second bag, it would not be $30, but $40.    When I called ""Customer Care"", I was referred online. But online would not allow my ""concern"" to be posted to them, because I was flying ""economy"". So I paid ""economy"".for a seat on a bus that I had to pay for anyway.    No thanks, United, and here is a middle finger right back at you."
Feb 2020,20,BEREAVEMENT??!,"After losing a younger brother in Montana-my wife and I were trying to get to the funeral! We booked a flight (via Denver) THREE TIMES before ever getting there! One of their sites got us a SCAM Charge on our credit card-The second time we booked, one of United’s agents called us to tell us that our flight was cancelled by mistake (and did nothing to help is REbook!) It took THREE TIMES to finally get a trip to this funeral!!? All their numbers direct you to a place in the Phillipines (or India), where they don’t speak clear English, don’t know what BEREAVEMENT means, and could CARE LESS about our problem!?? United wouldnt make any amends for any of their mistakes, and even charged us for baggage TWICE-once online, and again at the counter!!? There is NO POSSIBLE WAY to talk to an English Speaking American using any of the Numerous Numbers they provide online-to solve problems and reach a representative to report SCAM!! In total, we are out about $2500 for this short flight ( for both of us), and we still have no guarantee that we will ever get any of this overcharge back onto our cards!? One online agent told us that their BEREAVEMENT FARES had been cancelled TWO YEARS AGO-while a Gate Agent told us that was not true!!?Another told us that we were scammed because we used the WRONG NUMBER to call-after I told him that we called 1-800-UNITED1! He LIED!!"
Feb 2020,30,Flight from MIA to ORD,Excellent flight. On time departure and arrival. Charming and professional flight attendants. Excellent check in and baggage delivery. United had pushed back the flight by 2 hours giving us 10 days notice. Unfortunately it cost us about $150 in additional taxi fares in Chicago
Feb 2020,30,Flight from ORD to MIA,Good flight. On time departure and arrival. Lousy seats as they put us in 30th row after we had reservations in 9th row. Charming and professional flight attendants. Excellent baggage claim
Feb 2020,10,"I will take a ship to Maui before I fly United again.,","We bought the economy tickets at $733 because the next grade up was $1,240 - $500 difference per seat, there were six of us and I paid for it, when we come home, we was only used 5 tickets, I wanted to use the extra ticket (seat) for two of the larger people, but United said no, he canceled out so we keep the money $733, and then they could resell that ticket to somebody else, my question, I ,already paid for the seat why could we not let my party use it. VERY UNHAPPY"
Feb 2020,40,flying friendly skies,"Typical economy flight. Stopped in Chicago.Long walk to go from one gate to the next.  easy to get through Orlando airport to car rental counter. On the return flight we opted to upgrade to priority seating, which was much more comfortable. Beats the heck out  of a really long drive in January...."
Feb 2020,10,Anything but United,"My family have twice experienced negative service from United.  They are very inflexible, pay no mind to child safety having chosen to sit our 8 yo, and 10 yo more than 10 rows away from the nearest adult despite us all being on the same booking."
Feb 2020,40,United - Houston to Amsterdam,"United is a very professional organization, with excellent planes and well trained staff. I enjoyed the flight, the staff was very helpful and surprisingly, the food was good. When I have business that takes me to Europe, I will continue to use United as my perferred carrier."
Feb 2020,40,Non-Stop Round trip to Cancun and Back,"Our round trip flight to Cancun and back on United was great! We got in early to our destination to Cancun. On the way back we also had a great flight. However, for first class dinner choices, they ran out of Salmon, which was a bummer, since I don't eat meat. The alternate was Chicken. So I got Chicken and my husband ate it! Perhaps, some other Vegan dinner options would be nice."
Feb 2020,40,"Good flight, but a bit of a bumpy landing.","Good flight, love that it was non-stop to Key West. Pretty spot to land, surrounded by water. Good service, also."
Feb 2020,30,Hurry up and wait and wait for a new plane,"When we checked in, we were told that our plane had a mechanical problem. United told us to return the next day for the earliest flight out. No, we said, and insisted on another flight out that day. They searched and gave us Air Canada, to Montreal, then to DC. We languished at the airport for hours, before we took off for Montreal, only to languish another 4 hours there. Tough flight home!"
Feb 2020,40,Improvements noted,"While United's business class has been elevated, the Premium Economy and Economy is in the 'doghouse', especially when it comes to food selection. The pre-landing offer hasn't changed in years and is the same old warmed up turkey and cheese sandwich in a microwave bag. Ask the passengers about this and they'll say it's just a little better than awful. Also, having tried to upgrade using United's new Bonus Points (since they've converted from the Regional and Global Upgrade system is really a disappointment. As a multi-year 1K traveler, I've found them difficult to use and the 72 hour upgrade notification just is not working. I accept that there are many people who fly a lot more than I do, but this new system sucks out upgrade points for trivial short haul legs vs. the longer hauls where it's really valued."
Feb 2020,30,"average all round and Business class paired seating ,awkward",Dreamliner had better room and slighlty better configuration of BC paired but travelling alone on window was really frustrating long haul getting over adjacent passenger.  Round the world BC best leg qantas config worst swiss air.
Feb 2020,30,No empty seats,"Another plane fully loaded, departing on time from Atlanta, landing earlier in Chicago and then waiting 30 minutes for free gate.  I don't get it why plane is landing earlier(means it flays faster then schedule), but then has to wait extra time for free gate. From landing to reaching the gate it took about 30 minutes.

Feb 2020,40,Faster then schedule,"I can say that this flight was successful. The plane was on time departing from Chicago and has arrived to Atlanta a little bit earlier then schedule.  Atlanta has welcomed us with beautiful sunny weather.  The flight service was as average: ""micro snack"" and drink.  The plane was full, so for some people there was no room for luggage. The suitcases have been moved to the plane's bottom storage.    RomanP"
Feb 2020,50,Awesome Trip,This is the first airline experience in over 2 years in which everything was awesome. The last 3 flying vacations we took were a disaster. United provided excellent service all around. Couldnt be happier!
Feb 2020,30,United is not what it was in the past,"Flight attendants were very helpful and nice.  Every thing was on time.  Plane was not clean.  Waiting area was not clean.  Most of the time you were only a ticket not a person. Except on the plane.  Will shop around for next flight, nothing special any more."
Feb 2020,10,United Does Not Apologize,"After United switched our scheduled flight times after purchasing our tickets to Anchorage, we got no help re-booking flights causing us to completely rearrange our travel plans. We got no apology.    My husband is a silver card member, and at each check-in, we were always told we had a bag check fee (there is supposed to be no fee for a checked bag with a silver membership), and had to speak to multiple people until it was resolved. This was every single time, on a multi-leg trip. No apology from United was given.    At the United Club in Chicago, today at 2:25 PM, instead of being helpful in any way to answer our questions, they decided to talk about their own concerns, passing snacks to and from each other with smiles and then staring at us like we were inconveniencing them.    We took Delta for our first half of the trip since United did not help us re-book our flight to a time we could make after they changed the original time. We had no issues with Delta. Everyone was pleasant. The plane had better seats. Customer service, wouldn’t know because there were no issues.    My husband is cutting up his card and using Delta for now on. The tickets might seem to be a little more expensive, but what you Save in hidden fees and frustration from United is worth much more.    The only usable advice from United when we talked to them was this: United does not apologize for their new policies.    United is robotic, insincere, and full of effortless excuses."
Feb 2020,10,Beware of United flights to Montrose,"Flew on time from Denver to Montrose. Upon arrival, approximately 1/2 of passengers received baggage. The rest of us didn’t. I understand that mishaps occur but I got the impression that this was a common occurrence. My first night of my ski vacation was spent dealing with the customer service process and my first full day of my ski vacation has been spent trying to figure out when my ski equipment will arrive. I’m usually very patient with this type of thing but United just doesn’t seem to appreciate how negatively this effects people’s vacations.    Hoping family and friends are enjoying their day on the mountain...... I’m still waiting. Looking forward to getting reimbursed for my free toothbrush in 6 weeks."
Feb 2020,30,New Points Plus system is a disaster,"Tried to use these new plus points (that United has installed instead of upgrades) and discovered that my ""status"" changed one day before and I lost all the points. They wouldn't reinstate them so I lost approximately $10,000 worth of upgrades. No warning, no way to appeal. I'm cancelling their United Explorer Visa that was supposedly going to help acquire status; they changed that as well and it won't help. So much for loyal customers!!"
Feb 2020,50,Nothing bad,I used to work in customer service and our saying is customers are more likely to complain when they receive bad service.    In my case everything went off fairly well. Unlike the last time I went back home to Chicago from Hawaii at least the seats weren't unbearably uncomfortable. That would be a legitimate complaint as I remember the back pain I suffered for a couple hours.    I spent most of the time sleeping on the flight. The flight attendants were passing out beverages and snacks.
Feb 2020,10,Flying the Friendly Skies? Avoid United,"After a fabulous vacation in Thailand, we were left in mid air over nine hours with no working entertainment system, mediocre food, inadequate leg room despite paying for upgrade, and a customer service nightmare upon our return. I have nine emails from various “customer service”representatives, one phone message that was called “a mistake”, and a partial resolution. The most upsetting thing was learning that after we paid $281 to upgrade our seats (legroom is awful), at least four other passengers including two family members were upgraded for free!!! When I applied for a refund I was given different stories from different reps, I tried returning a phone call a rep made to me to no avail, kept trying to discuss the unfairness of the charge and finally received a refund for one upgrade but not the other!!! I’ve repeatedly sent a copy of my receipt to customer service which always refers me to another site. It’s hard to believe an airline of United’s magnitude can’t deliver a simple credit card refund! Supposedly there also is a credit of $100 for a soda spill an attendant made all over my husband, and another $100 credit to make up for no entertainment system. I’m not sure where this “credit” is at this point. We will be avoiding United in the future, and if you want a happy ending to your trip, I suggest you do the same thing."
Feb 2020,40,"left early, on time arrival, uneventful flight","Departed early at 7:50 AM to get a lower cost fare. Arrived on time at 1:03 PM. Long hike from the gate to our connecting flight to Austin, lugging two suitcases."
Feb 2020,40,"uneventful, on time flight from Houston to San Diego","Uneventful, on time trip from Houston to San Diego. Departed at noon and arrived at 1:27 PM local time. Oh, how I long for the days when your fare included a checked bag, instead of everyone dragging on to the plane a medium size suitcase and struggling to find a spot in the overhead bins."
Feb 2020,30,"average, usually wait awhile for bags","Not a horrible airlines, but not my favorite either. Of course have to pay for every upgrade, but even in economy row 25 we didnt have phone chargers! apparently 1-21 has them but even when I pay higher than their lowest rate, I didnt get one. And another plane didnt even have one. Also wouldn't check our bags through with Alaska either which is frustrating. I fly with them because I have to, butt not my first choice."
Feb 2020,50,"Honolulu, January 2020",United made the best of a very long flight. Excellent service. Professional air crew. 'Would look forward to flying them (long-haul) again.
Feb 2020,50,Perfectly fine,"Trip to Denver, went fine, or at least as good as possible. My luck in that the trip from Columbus to Denver I had to go through Chicago and major delays due to a snow storm in Chicago. Lots of ground stops.... was lucky to get to Denver that day, but the good point is that United did all they could and I am sure it was a long day for the United ticket agents and Customer Reps in Columbus and Chicago as they had to handle all of the passengers in a difficult situation. Every United Airline Customer Service person was professional in a difficult time. No delay issues coming back from Denver, and it helped that I had a direct flight back and no layover in Chicago.  For the flight, typical flights both over and back..... They did a good job."
Feb 2020,10,allways canceled flights,"United airlines always cancels flights, they are truly horrible, don't fly with them if you have an option. They are awful with no customer service and real attitudes when you don't like what you're doing. This may be one of the worst airlines in the world. I will never fly with them again! They are horrible Beyond belief, I hate them with a passion. And you will too. Fly another airline.."
Feb 2020,10,Bailey Plocher,This is the worst airline! First time flying United and it will be my last. Everyone at the front desk that I spoke to was SO rude when I was kindly trying to get some help. My flight was delayed causing me to miss my other United flight. Not impressed at all.
Feb 2020,10,Winter Vacation to Washington DC,"When I booked the reservation through a third party travel site, it stated ECONOMY. When I checked in I was told the reservation is BASIC ECONOMY. I called the travel site and they insisted it is regular economy. United did not bother to give me an explanation about the downgrade. Since I traveled with my family, we were separated according to Basic Economy fare rule. On the return trip back to Los Angeles, we cleared security but the gate was very far. My son went ahead and inform gate agent we are on the way but the she said the gate closes on time and will not wait even through we were running to the gate. So much for customer service. Never again. Do not fly UNITED."
Feb 2020,10,The worst service ever in the aviation history,"While returning from SFO to PWM, our plane got delayed at SFO for some unknown reason. The connecting flight was at Newark where plane to PWM left 5 minutes early. We missed the plane to PWM due to United air's delay in SFO. Now they told us either stay inside the airport for 28 hours for next or fly to Boston which is f.....ing 2 and something hours from PWM. I don't know where to go when landed in Boston. This is the nastiest service I have ever experienced in flying. Will never ever take this s..ty airline again."
Feb 2020,20,Food allergies,"I have flown a lot in the last few years. This is the only airline I have been on that is actually unfriendly to people with food allergies. Other airlines have gluten free options for people with this allergy. Except for one airline attendant who found me a snack, the others on 3 flights, not only said they had nothing unless I wanted to purchase it, but were not even nice. Their attitude was “ that’s your problem.” I have a serious auto immune disorder. This is NOT a diet “choice”. Even when I explained that they just shrugged."
Feb 2020,20,Oldest plane I had ever seen,I seriously started to wonder what the regulations were on how old a plane can be to be continued in service. This plane had to be from the late 60’s or early 70’s. You could see the patch work where they removed the old TV’s from the over head bins. The bins themselves were filthy and my carryon had stains on it afterwards. The seats were like old hard plastic public transportation seats. My knees where in my chest with zero leg room. Awful flight.
Feb 2020,10,Airplane issues,"I have never flown United without an airplane issue causing delays. Spend some money on new planes. Flight attendants are fine, pilots are fine but it is ridiculous to travel for 15 hours when it’s suppose to take 6 all due to issues with aircraft. Unless I have no choice, this will be my last trip on United Airlines until they improve all of their fleet."
Feb 2020,20,Their rules...,"We booked tickets through a webiste and had no idea of United’s rules for seat assignments, luggage etc. Upon arriving at the airport and checking in we were told with our ticked type of seat we could only carry on our “personal item” anything rlse would be charged accordingly. My backpack had my computer/electronics in it. I then had a small courier bag that had passport, phone, wallet, cash all for easy access while traveling. I had to dislodge computer work papers to shove courier bag into it because your ticket doesn’t include. When I got to the gate I looked up and sure enough my ticket had this “emblem” (I thought it was no “suitcase” sign) also looked at the website I booked from and that was the ONLY type ticket they sold. Then when boarding the man in front of me had a carry on, that was a suitcase and the agent said his ticket was a no carry on ticket (like mine) but with the line growing she let him on with it. I was brewing. This was my first and last time flying United. Most airlines are piss poor anymore but United is even worse and they don’t care."
Feb 2020,10,Awful!,"Very bad staff! And services are awful! They refused me boarding because i had a little hole in my jeans pants. I had black shiny shoes, a shirt and jacket but a little whole in my jeans! Seriously?!? So they made me purchase a new jeans right away last minute before boarding from SFO. What a crap! Never again!"
Feb 2020,30,Average,The flight was mediocre to say the least.  The baggage scenario was a fiasco nearly everybody had small suitcases which the steward/stewardesses were busy putting in the overhead baggage compartments at the detriment of those passengers who had normal carry on baggage....it was unbelievably disrespectful for the passengers that travelled normal with appropriate hand luggage.
Feb 2020,30,Disappointing return,At one time United was our favorite airlines. It is not anymore. We flew United back from Australia. The problems started with ordering our dinner for the flight. As the flight attendant started asking customers for their meal choice she started to jump around the area. We were 2nd to last to be asked even though we were seated closer to the front of the business section. By the time she came to us they were out of our choices. So maddening. There was a lack of service that was apparent. I usually ask for nothing when I fly as we don’t drink but we received next to no attention at all.  It was a long 14 1/2 hours.
Feb 2020,40,FUN FLIGHTS!,"This trip required changing planes in Denver. Due to a mechanical problem, we left Medford 45 minutes late. The pilot made up some of the time but we had only 25 minutes to get to our gate in another terminal building in Denver. We made it and, miraculously, so did our luggage! For once we opted for business class seats and were so glad we did. At 6'5"" I have been crushed more than once in economy. Service was excellent, check-in a breeze. The only knock was that coming home they served the same meal we were served on the way to Philly."
Feb 2020,30,Disappointed,"I’ve always flown in economy class with United and thought it was okay. However, I decided to fly business class on a very long trip (ANA partnered with United from Japan). I didn’t expect much from economy but more so in business class. The food was very disappointing and it was quite cold in the plane, especially if you sit by the window. I was also surprised when I was informed they ran out of food and only had one option left for dinner. Again- wouldn’t have cared much if it was in economy but. The restrooms weren’t also cleaned very frequently. I’ve sat in another airline in economy class and their restrooms are always cleaned and supplies restocked at all times. Customer service was good. The seats felt very high tech. Overall, if I wasn’t paying so much, I’d probably be having an attitude just getting from point A to point B."
Feb 2020,50,Very comfortable long flight,We boarded and departed on time and the process was very smooth. Watched three movies which helped pass the time. In flight food and beverage was good and we arrived 20 minutes early. Great flight.
Feb 2020,40,on board service,"big improvement onboard service, good hot food, beberages and customer service,  better leg room and attendants very helpful."
Jan 2020,40,Easy to Sleep,"We flew from Osaka to San Francisco in Polaris (Business) Class on a Boeing 787-8. Ground personnel were professional and helpful and the plane departed on time for the almost 10-hour flight. Our cabin proved to be clean and well maintained and the toilets did not become as disgraceful as usual. The food, however, continues to be mediocre.    I fly Polaris, however, for the comfort and the ability to sleep because the seats totally recline. The bedding is good and I appreciate the slippers. All the equipment worked at my seat, such as lights and the video offerings. But the cabin temperature remained quite cold throughout the flight.    Flight attendants were exceptionally professional and pleasant. One brought me extra blankets when I said I was cold and she essentially tucked me in. I slept for at least half the flight and noted no turbulence while I was awake. We arrived in San Francisco on time."
Jan 2020,50,Smooth and on time,"United did everything expected with on time, clean plane, easy check in and all the bases covered. Highly recommend them as their service has continue to improve over the years."
Jan 2020,10,United Airlines....poor as usual!,"Flight times changed, extremely rude flight attendants, selected seating changed & separated from family members, United Club closed without being told, multiple flight delays while flights after ours going out on time to same destination.I’m not quite sure how many more ridiculous issues United can come up with before people (myself included) completely stop flying with them....mileage club member or not. If they keep pulling this crap, they’re sure to be out of business within a few years!"
Jan 2020,30,Some flights were just OK,One stop in Houston. Seats were uncomfortable. No padding and no room. Fortunately flying time on both fights was short.
Jan 2020,50,RIC-GUC,"I love going on United Airlines to go to Gunnison, That is one of the airlines that fly into Gunnison"
Jan 2020,50,A nice flight on a full plane,"This flight was fully booked like many flights to/from Vegas. I fly over 100k miles per year, so I spend lots of time on a plane. Despite the full plane, the crew did a nice job respectful and helpful communicating such that it helped the boarding process and prevented a lack of overhead space from being an issue.  In flight, having the personal video system via your own digital device is a nice feature and having outlets at each seat helps so that the device can be used the entire flight.  Overall the crew was pleasant and nice and I think tried to make sure everyone was getting what they needed."
Jan 2020,10,"Either fly into danger or lose $1,000!","My sister and I were supposed to be flying out of Kansas City to Puerto Rico on the day after the recent major earthquake in Puerto Rico. We had booked our flight through a third party(bad idea!). When the government declared a state of emergency on the island, we naturally decided it was probably not a good idea to travel that week. Upon gathering further information, we were told that power was out on the island and most of the hotels were running off of generators. Upon trying to cancel our reservations, we were told that the only option was to fly out within a seven day window from our original departure date. Let it be known there was another major earthquake after our departure date. Naturally we decided it was probably not the wisest idea to travel to an area where at the moment the drinking water and food would be limited until power was restored. Since we were not going to travel within the seven day window, we were told there is nothing they can do. Basically they decided we were going to make a donation of $1000 to them for being such an amazing airline. I understand and respect that there are protocols to situations, but to force a passenger to either fly into a possible hazardous situation or forgo $1,000 is absurd. Third party site or not, it is ultimately up to the airlines to refund a passenger. United has decided they would rather you fly into a possible unsafe situation, then simply refund your money or issue a voucher for future departures."
Jan 2020,20,Flying with United should be your last resort,"It would take a lot of convincing or a free flight to fly with United ever again, especially Internationally. We can all be a little grinchy on a long flight, of course, but having flown with Air China, Air France and British Airways, I know the trip can be done with much more care and comfort. United should be a last resort option."
Jan 2020,50,travelling during Christmas 2019,"The flight was comfortable however there was complete chaos in dropping the baggage. this has also resulted in dispatch of luggage to a different location.thanks to the ground staff at Sacramento, they were able to locate the baggage( which was sent to a different destination) and got it delivered at our place of stay."
Jan 2020,50,"Fast trip, faster than expected.","We had a great fast flight, Our flight attendant was pleasant. We traveled with our dogs and were treated nicely. The dogs were comfortable and so were we."
Jan 2020,20,Very 'Budget',"United has officially become - in my mind - one of the budget carriers (Spirit, Frontier, Allegiant, etc.). The fact that they're the only of the Big 3 to charge for a carry-on (American, Delta, and United) must put them in that category - they're just a lot bigger than the other budget carriers. I guess the good news (if you can call it that) is that United is now a new 'global' budget carrier option! They're also more expensive than all the other budget carriers. The most expensive by far.    Delta is way better than American and United, but now United has removed itself from that category of carrier. I fly at least once a month, used to be forced to choose between American and United because of ORD - nice that I don't have to make that decision anymore. Save $ and fly with one of the more affordable budget carriers, or spend a smidge more to fly with one of the Big 2 (American or Delta)."
Jan 2020,10,When Cheaper Is NOT Betterl,"Learned an important lessen a few days ago! We learned that cheaper is not always better.    Some time ago we had needed to book a flight from Las Vegas to San Jose, Costa Rica. While scanning alternatives one stood out – a one-stop combo on United Airlines with a short stop in Houston.    The first flight (from LAS to IAH) was United Airlines Flight #634. Markedly cheaper! Pressed that button!    The plane was a 737-800, which was fine with us. But when we boarded the plane, we noticed the change. It appears that UA had a new seat configuration on this craft. The already limited room for legs had been further reduced on this craft.    The next two and half hours was pure torture.    Upon our arrival in Houston, I attempted to upgrade our tickets. Learned that I could not – that our tickets were not eligible for upgrade.    Fortunately, the second leg of this journey was much better – another flight on a UA 737-800, but with that missing leg room.    Unfortunately, that first flight had had consequences for me. Those consequences are real and lasting – five fresh lacerations on my shins.    So, pay attention to the fine print – Cheaper is NOT always better!"
Jan 2020,40,Good flight,"The flight was on time and all went better than expected. A refreshing change! For th e prices they charge, the services, once included, should be again."
Jan 2020,50,Staff went beyond the call of duty,"We left a tablet in a plane from SAN to IAD, and discovered it when we had taken our seats on flight 6011. I told a stewardess about this, and she gave permission to go back to the desk and tell those there. I did. They called, and the tablet had been found, but they didn't want to hold 6011. So I went back and told the stewardesses for 6011. They consulted the captain, and HE ran (I guess) to the gate where our previous plane had landed, and got it for us, possibly making the flight a couple of minutes late."
Jan 2020,50,Flight Attendant,I was headed to the Keys with my wife for a wedding. We were leaving our 10 month old for the first time. It was a nerve racking experience leaving our son for the first time . We developed a relationship with a wonderful flight attendant. We landed safely and I mistakenly left my jacket onboard the plane. (New Jersey to Florida in January) Katherine Piesco Ziegler sent my jacket at her own expense back to New Jersey and it was there before we were!    There should be more people like Katherine in the world
Jan 2020,50,United,"An airplane is a vehicle for change, transporting its voyager to a different location as well as perhaps state of mind. I came into the United Airlines aircraft unprepared for the journey ahead. I was stuck feeding my anxieties by empowering a false sense of self, a self that would be defined by how many museums and landmarks I check of my bucket list. A self defined by what tangible things I could gain to move my life forward. But sometimes it takes moving forward at the speed of 2178 miles/hour to recognize the importance of standing still.  United Airlines helped me reframe my journey ahead the way no other airline could. When I told Clare the gentle British flight attendant I didn’t want a drink, she intuited that I was denying my feelings of thirst and insisted I have a drink. With over 200 movies, United made sure to include the entirety of a movie series. And to top it off, the flight was empty! So as I sprawled eating vanilla ice cream watching Ratatouille, I finally felt relief.  I took a deep breath in, observing my surroundings; a family of chassidim noting the kosher meal wasn’t up to their standards, a tween watching a sex scene, an elderly man ignoring the seat belt sign. Yet there was something so liberating about these people, something quintessentially United about their uninhibited ability to live fully in the moment. I exhaled my false sense of self. I wasn’t escaping into the future or the past. United Airlines Unites us together with the present."
Jan 2020,50,"Delay flight home, but for our safety!",We were a couple of hours delayed because of weather close to Denver. The crew kept us informed and were always courteous. I am always happy when our flight problems take place while I am on the ground! Our eventual landing in Denver was as smooth as silk!
Jan 2020,30,Good Flights to Bozeman,"Haven't flown United in some time but all flights were fine, just one was delayed because of a broken seat. My only negative on United is you're not able to pick your seats when in economy if you don't opt to pay extra for a seat..I certainly thought I was purchasing a ticket for a seat but I guess picking it is a privilege."
Jan 2020,10,Boycott United Airline,"After few years not flying united, read up on it and thought I will give it a try. Business class service was awful. was told there are no breakfast choices so egg white over wet muffin??? Mile play was a scam, purchased ticket was short $10 of purchase amount requirement, so I called their agent and was told I can upgrade seat or upgrade to business class to qualify, according to the rules ""4. the final fare amount for the trip will be used to determine satisfaction of offer requirements, including itinerary changes that result in an increase or decrease to the fare and paid upgrades that result in an increase to the fare"" paid the upgrade, did not receive the promo miles, call customer service talked to an off shore agent, he then talked to a supervisor and assured me that the additional miles will post to my account that day (gave me his name and his agent #) still did not get the miles a week later, called customer service again, gave them the agent name & number, was told he is a united customer service agent but that they can't let me talk to him and that I should email customer service instead???"
Jan 2020,50,Great Flight,"I did Basic Economy for the first time. Was not excited about baggage rules. However, once we cleared that hurdle it was a great experience, on time, clean, friendly service. Looking back over the years, if I were to commit to an airline's frequent flyer program it would be United over any other airline."
Jan 2020,50,Uneventful how I prefer it to be,Got me home safe and sound. On time. Restrooms clean. Little delays w take off or landing. Luggage prompt.
Jan 2020,20,"If United Ops is going to decide to not serve food on a 2.5 hour flight, let passengers know","This was a flight that had a non weather flight delay in excess of 90 mins. Some maintenance issue with the original aircraft from the source location and required use of alternate aircraft.  Where United was great was keeping awareness through the app and text as soon as the delay was known, as well as communicating cause and what they were going to do about it.    Where they completely missed the boat was they were not planning on serving food (for purchase) on the 2.5 hour flight which is now standard on every flight. Its possible that changing the equipment had something to do with it. But if that change meant that food was not going to be served because no time to move food from one to the other, that information was known to at least a dozen people in United as the aircraft left from its point of origin.    They should have had the courtesy to communicate to the Orlando gate agent so she/he could at least announce to the passengers about this so we could get food while we were in Orlando waiting the 90 minutes.    The flight dispatcher sitting in the high rise HQ in Chicago doesn't realize that traveling public expects safe, reliable flying, and has certain expectations of service that meets United's normal threshold. United only delivered on the safety part of it. May be the flight dispatcher should be required to not have food on a 2 hour flight thats over dinner time so they know what its like. I doubt he/she gave up their dinner.    This was a 6pm flight that got delayed to 7:30pm and at 8pm in the air when service starts is not the time to tell passengers that they only have drinks. That 90 minute delay got us into EWR right after all the concessions in the terminal closed. So no food till I checked in at my hotel in Manhattan at 11:15pm thanks to complete lack of transparency and traveler empathy.    Situation was likely not avoidable but at least communicate to gate agent so they can announce and passengers can make alternate decisions about food before leving and flying United does not commit them to a 11:30pm dinner."
Jan 2020,20,Why don’t United tell you in advance when they cancel your flight,"We were flying from Bozeman to Orlando via Denver. When we came to check in 24 hours before departure we found that our flight from Denver to Orlando had been cancelled and we were now booked on a flight that left 2 hours later so we were now scheduled to arrive in Orlando at 11:06 pm instead of 9:15 pm. This was the first we knew about the flight change — no emails, no phone calls, nothing. That is really poor customer service. When we arrived at Bozeman airport and spoke to United staff they just shrugged their shoulders and told us it happens a lot and they don’t know why. As for the flights themselves — our flight from Bozeman to Denver was about 40 minutes late in departing due to bad weather but luckily as it arrived empty the ground staff got everyone on board quickly and also checked that everyone with connecting flights delay would not be effected by the delay The flight took 75 minutes and the cabin crew were excellent, friendly and very efficient. We boarded the flight from Denver to Orlando on time and just as we were boarding the airport was hit by a snow storm which meant that the plane as with many others needed de-icing. So we sat on the ground whilst the plane was de-iced for another 90 minutes. The cabin & flight crew were again excellent updating us as to what was going on. The inflight entertainment was better than average. The flight down to Orlando was very good and we eventually landed at 12:40 am. It is just a shame that all the good work done by United’s staff should be undone by dreadful customer service."
Jan 2020,40,Fly back from Singapore,"I like the Dreamliner, it's well designed. the UA Polaris seat configuration seems a bit tight, albeit a lie flat bed. I have a Bose QC wireless headset but hate that I can't pair it with the PES audio, I have to use my audio wires and connect to the outlet, which is behind the seat on the right, very awkward position as the Bose jack is on the left, so my mobility is limited bc of the wire running across my back. Service seems to be improving, crew were friendly and attentive. I had to download my boarding pass on my phone to check it the SQ lounge, but the receptionist failed to alert me that UA required a paper boarding pass, I was turned around the gate! The SIN airport is amazing, been rated #1 for decades, and continues to improve. It's a great place to spend long layovers."
Jan 2020,30,Flight home not great!,"This was the second part of our trip home from a week in Mexico. First we were told that there would be a delay while they performed some small maintenance on a door (inner door). Once it was fixed, which put us about 15 minutes behind, they started to board us. Everyone got up and was preparing to board the plane, when we were told that another issue had been found on a gas panel and it needed to be fixed. We were seated again to wait. We finally got on the plane and sat, when we were told that they were still working on problems and we would leave when we could. By the time we got to St. Louis, we were about 45 minutes late. By the time we got our luggage, which took forever, we got to our hotel after midnight. We were exhausted! While I know maintenance issues need to be addressed, I wish they had been more forthcoming with their information. The flight attendants seemed to be quite perturbed and were not very friendly to us during the flight."
Jan 2020,50,Better than expected,Better than expected. On-time departure. Good customer service in check-in counter. The plane was clean.
Jan 2020,40,UA2339 San Francisco to Phoenix A319 FC Seats 1E & F,"This was the final leg of a trip to Houston, New Orleans, Washington DC and finally San Francisco, before heading home to Phoenix. On March 14, we flew UA2339 from SFO to PHX on an AirBus A319 (#4008), in FC, Seats 1E & F. This was to have been #4033, but the plane was swapped out, before the flight. As we had booked the San Francisco portion rather late (meeting added at the last minute), we were unable to get our “regular” seats, so had the bulkhead in front of us. Being a bulkhead, there is obviously no underseat storage. Everything (and I mean everything) must be stored in the overhead bins.    Row 1, on the A319 also does not have the legroom, that row 2 has. Otherwise, it is not a bad seat, just not an ideal seat, and one loses a bit of width, as the fuselage begins to taper, at about the bulkhead - plus I had to keep my hat on the floor, next to my feet.    The FC cabin is 2-2, where E/E+ is 3-3. The FC seats were all replaced a few years back, and we find them to be very nice, and comfortable, though in the full upright position, there is still a bit of recline built in. These seats recline into their shell, by allowing the lower cushion to slide forward, reclining the back cushion, with little intrusion into the area behind. There is a marble-topped podium, and then useful pockets all around each seat, though those cannot be used for storage for takeoff, or for landing. We had ample AC outlets, so charged a few devices, when we were above 10,000'. The tray tables also have a holder, into which an iPad fits nicely, though it is slightly offset, due to the articulation of the tray table.    We arrived at SFO a bit early, so stopped into the AMEX Centurion Lounge, near Gate 75 in T3. This worked out well, as we departed from Gate 75, though our flight was originally scheduled out of Gate 65, and then Gate 89. When we got the update, via the great United App, we knew that we would be rather far away, in one of the United Clubs, and the Centurion Lounge was right there!    We walked across the concourse, and were ready to board, just before Group 1. Because of the lack of underseat storage in Row 1, this made life easier, as both briefcases, and my wife’s purse had to go into the overhead bins Being Global Services (I flew 208 flights on UA in 2018, and my wife 206 - plus several other flights on two other airlines) does offer some nice perks, and early boarding is certainly one of them, and especially as this flight was 100% full..    We had our jackets hanging behind Row 2, and were settled in. We opted for the District 7 Monterey County Chardonnay, which we had first encountered on an earlier flight on this trip.    This ship was equipped with the PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) which streams audio and video via the United App. That worked well on the short flight. It also had WiFi for a charge, but neither used it, as we had done all of our online work in the Centurion Lounge.    The weather was nice, though it had rained earlier in the afternoon. We took off on runway 1L into light clouds and haze (plus smoke from some near-by wild fires) and had those, all of the way to PHX. Over the years, the takeoff pattern from Runway 1L has changed quite a few times. Once, the view of the Golden Gate Bridge was from the port side of the aircraft. Then the pattern was tightened, putting the view on the starboard side. On this takeoff, we were quite a ways down the peninsula, so the Golden Gate was rather far in the distance, and that haze and smoke did not help the view..    The flight was smooth, and there were passed snacks, and I tried the Sea Salt & Black Pepper Kettle Chips No 98 - just OK. However, we did have the District 7 Monterey Chardonnay, and the Fortant Terroir Littoral Cabernet Sauvignon. Both were nice wines.    We were just a bit late into PHX, but nothing to complain about. Our luggage was up onto Carousel 4 rather quickly.    Our cabin crew was very nice, and efficient.    We were headed home in enough time to do a washing, before packing for our next flights to Chicago."
Jan 2020,50,Good flight as expected,This is a 18 hour flight. The flight is long and of course tiring. We left Adelaide airport Wed Jan 29th flying to Sydney then Sydney to Houston. First flight was 7 am. Second flight 11:00 am. We arrived because of date line and time difference on Wed Jan 29th at 9 am in Houston. The pasta going from Houston to Sydney had been well prepared and great flavor. Even a little hot sauce so very slight. Coming from Sydney to Houston the Pasta was bland and had no flavor. In fact it was pasta with chunks of carrots. No taste no flavor. That is not the airline fault as much as the kitchen chef that prepares the food.
Jan 2020,40,Mar - UA604 Phoenix to Denver 737-800 FC Seats 2A & B,"On Friday, March 08, we flew United Airlines UA604, from Phoenix (PHX) to Denver (DEN) in First Class, Seats: 2A & B, on a 737-800 (738) #3235. We were connecting at DEN, for our final destination, New Orleans (MSY). This was not our normal route, as we usually fly to New Orleans via Houston (IAH). We had schedule conflicts, which made the PHX-DEN-MSY route better for us.    For us, United Airlines is mostly a given. With our FF status, branded credit cards, and usually very good, to excellent service, they are our “go-to airline.” In 2018, I did 208 flights on UA, and my wife was just behind me. Now, she did fly more on Southwest, than I did, and a few more on American, but still, we always try to fly United, as our first choice, even though we do not live near one of their hub airports.    We started our morning in the little United Club, across from Gate 7, for Champagne.    We boarded at Gate 3 (the largest of the UA gates at PHX - and decked out with baseball pennants, but I am not sure why in March?), at the other end of T2 from the United Club, just a few minutes late, and before Group 1, due to our status. We were in our seats quickly, with our jackets hanging in the forward closet. The flight was completely full, so it did take just a bit of time, to board everyone. This plane was doing the yo-yo between PHX and DEN, and with such flights, it is easy to get a bit behind schedule, but not be able to make up much time.    This was one of the older 738's, and was from the UA side of the fleet, so no DirectTV. However, we did have IFE via the United App, providing streaming audio and video. The plane had WiFi (for purchase), but we did not use it.    The 737-800 First Class is configured with 4 rows of 2-2 seating, so there are A&B, and E&F seats, and no designated C, or D seats. Behind FC, there is a bulkhead and curtain, before the 3-3 Economy Plus seats. We had a fully-functional AC outlet for each of us, in between our seats, which is always nice    This older ship had the smaller overhead bins, but my wife’s small, rolling briefcase fit fine, and my smaller briefcase fit easily under the seat. As this was not one of the sCO ships, with DirectTV, the underseat storage was fairly large. These seats had good recline, but I do not think that either of us used it. Also, I have to say that I like the FC seats, themselves, on the UA AirBus planes, after a refurbishment, some years back. These, are just OK.    The flight to DEN from PHX is about 1:40, but with a bit of weather in between, it was a bit longer today. During this short of a flight, there is beverage service and a passed basket of assorted snacks. We also had a pre-departure beverage, Coastal Vines Brut Cuvée sparkling wine, and one that I had not encountered before (not bad), during boarding, and before takeoff.    We got a good look at T3, which had partially opened, after a few years of remodel, and where UA will be moving in early 2020.    In-flight, we did another of the Coastal Vines sparklers and also the still white wine, which was District 7 Monterey County Chardonnay ‘15..    Though we took off into clouds, there were a few clear spots, but no good views of Meteor Crater, or the Painted Desert - one reason that we sat on the port side of the plane. We picked up fairly heavy clouds over the Rockies, where there was quite a bit of snow, but by the time we passed over Douglas County, the only snow visible was in the gullies. We did have to deviate a bit, from our normal direct approach, but other than a little turbulence, it was fine. However, we were going to be late by about 35 mins. Normally, that would not be an issue, as we always do easy connection times, but this trip, that was not possible, so we were going to be running. Also, we were initially pulling into Gate B47, with our departing flight to MSY scheduled for B42, but moved to B21. Then we were moved to B36, before operations decided on B14. At least the gates seemed to be moving back, closer to one another. The trek was not going to be long, but with all of the gate changing, we were pushing against a 40 min. late arrival to the gate, out of an original 57 min. connection, at close-by gates! Arriving at 5280' and having to run, was not in my plans, but at least we had seats in the front of the plane, and probably a United Global Services cart waiting for us, in the terminal. We were checking our luggage on the UA App, to see if it was going to make the transfer to the MSY flight.    Other than the slightly late take off, and then time lost skirting weather, making a tight connection tighter, it was a very good flight, with great Gate Agents at PHX, and a very good cabin crew. Here’s hoping that we make our connection!"
Jan 2020,40,Mar - UA1631 New Orleans to Washington/Dulles A320 FC Seats 3E & F,"On Monday, March 11, we were heading from New Orleans (MSY) to Washington, DC/Dulles (IAD) for meetings. We flew United Airlines on UA1631 on an AirBus A320 #4623 in First Class, Seats 3E & F. This plane had just flown in from IAD, doing a yo-yo route.    With a fairly early flight, we had stayed at the Hilton MSY Airport hotel. We took the shuttle to the airport (across the highway - but a very busy highway), in a light rain, and had bags checked, and were through TSA in no time, headed to Concourse D, and Gate D-5. Because check-in was so quick, and because we like to leave a bit more time, when catching flights - especially flights that are not that frequent - we stopped into Wow Cafe/Bar, just before our gate, for some sparkling wine. As we had been there before, we knew their limited wine list, and they still had the Wycliff “Brut” California sparkler, which will do in a pinch.    From our gate area, we could see the construction on the new terminal at MSY, and that was starting to take shape.    Boarding was on-time from MSY, though moved to Gate D3, and we were quickly into our seats for a pre-departure beverage service. We were in Row 3, E & F, with our jackets hanging on the bulkhead behind Row 4. We had two glasses of Wente Morning Fog Livermore Valley Chardonnay, prior to takeoff.    We took off in rain, with fairly dense clouds most of the way to Dulles, though the flight was smooth.    The A319/320 ships have all been outfitted with the newer seats in FC, but the bins are still smaller than on the newer 737-800/900 ships, with their new cabins. However, we like the FC seats in the AirBus planes better. This plane had streaming audio/video via the UA App, and the tray tables have a slot and holder, for iPads, etc. While slightly off-center for perfect viewing, it is a nice convenience. The plane also had WiFi for a fee, but neither of us used it.    Being a “breakfast flight,” we had a Ham & Cheese Croissant (sort of an “Egg McMuffin w/ Canadian Bacon/Ham), Chobani Greek Yogurt w/ mixed berries, mixed fruit bowl and more of the Wente Chard. This breakfast sandwich was actually pretty good - better than some of the “Omelettes” we have had on UA recently.    We arrived on-time at IAD, and though we find baggage arrival to be slow there, actually had our luggage onto Carousel 2 quickly, and were on our way to downtown rather quickly. Though the weather at Dulles was a bit better (no rain), it was marginally so.    The MSY Gate Agents, and the Cabin Crew, were all excellent, and the IFE system worked perfectly. In all, a very good flight."
Jan 2020,40,Mar - UA2008 Washington Dulles to San Francisco 737-900 FC Seats 2A & B,"After a short business trip to Washington DC, on March 13, we flew UA2008, on a 737-900 (#3887), in First Class, seats 2 A & B, so the port side of the plane. Originally, we were to fly on a 737-800W #3242, from the sCO side of the fleet, with DirectTV, but that ship had a mechanical issue, so we waited for our new plane. The original plane, a 738 was full, but there were seats available on the replacement plane, but it flew nearly full, even after all standby passengers made it aboard.    This was the fourth leg of a multi-city flight, mostly for business, with a brief stay in New Orleans, to see family.    We arrived at IAD early, as we always like to leave more time for travel from downtown, and then TSA Security, which is always a bit slow at IAD. We discovered that the airport had added Clear, so our TSA wait time was rather shorter, than expected. As per our usual, we stopped into the United Club near Gate C-7. As we were in the midst of an equipment swap, we decided that Moët was in order! Teach us to arrive early.    Our flight boarded at C-23 (moved from the closer C-11, before the plane change), almost an hour late due to incoming plane being changed out, and we were settled into our seats with a glass of Tiamo Prosecco, awaiting our departure. The 737-900 (739) has a nice little closet in FC, for hanging one’s jacket. Since we were headed San Francisco, we kept our overcoats with us, and they were also placed into the closet.    We had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) for free, providing streaming content via the UA App. There was WiFi (for a fee), but neither of us used that. We had flown from MSY to IAD a few days earlier on an A320 with the newer FC seats.    We had hot towels, and warmed nuts, and moved on to still wine, with the District 7 Monterey County Chardonnay ‘16.    We had the Butternut Squash-stuffed Manicotti (have had that a couple of times now), and the Grilled Pork Chop over Pasta (new main course for us), and both were quite tasty. Each came with a mixed salad. Lately, we have been less than impressed by the food in Domestic First Class on United, but both of these dishes were well-worth the calories.    Though we were into the clouds fairly quickly out of IAD, the weather cleared, and we flew over the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. We picked up a bit of haze and clouds into SFO, landing on Runway 28R.    The almost 1 hr delay was of no consequence, as we were flying into SFO a day before the meetings there, so only had to get to our hotel, and then to dinner that evening. Our baggage was out onto Carousel 1 fairly quickly. As we had arrived at Gate 68, on the East Pier at T3, it was at the far end of baggage claim - always seems to be the case at SFO.    Even with that delay, it was a very nice flight, another surprisingly good in-flight meal, a new wine for us, and a very friendly, efficient crew."
Jan 2020,40,Safe Flight,"While I felt very safe on the flights back home, I wish they had seatback entertainment. I don't like the idea of knowing I have to download an app on my phone or tablet before I board the plane. And actually, staff didn't mention this at the gate while waiting so I was disappointed I had to sit on my flight envious of others watching entertainment while I sat there bored for a few hours."
Jan 2020,40,Mar - UA1719 Denver to New Orleans 737-800 FC Seats 3A & B,"On Friday March 08, we flew United Airlines UA1719 from Denver (DEN) to New Orleans (MSY) in First Class, on a 737-800 (#3291). We were in Row 3 A & B. This was the second leg of our PHX-DEN-MSY trip - an odd routing for us, but we could not make our usual route, through IAH work.    This plane was from the Continental side of the fleet, so had DirectTV. This plane did not have the newer interior, with the “Dreamliner-like” ceiling and lighting, and also had the old, smaller overhead bins. The only downside of the sCO part of the fleet of 737's, is that the DirectTV equipment takes up a fair amount of the underseat storage, but my wife’s rolling briefcase fit nicely above, and with a bit of wedging, my briefcase fit in the middle below the seats in front of us.    FC is configured in 4 rows of 2-2, and the seats are comfortable, with good legroom. While for the medium-sized planes, we prefer the seats in UA’s A-319/320 FC, these are not bad. The drawback is the limited underseat storage in the sCO 737's, with DirectTV - but one does get DirectTV, which worked fine on this flight.    Normally, we book comfortable connections, but on this route, we had to take a 57 min. connection - less than I like, but it was the only choice. Initially, we were due to arrive, and depart only a few gates apart. Well, the PHX-DEN flight was late leaving, and then lost a little more time, skirting weather into DEN, and finally, our arrival gate was moved several times, putting us a little distance away. At least UA1719 was also moved, and a bit closer to our arrival, at B21. Still, we were now tight on time, and deplaning at 5280' above sea level too! We rushed off of the plane, and hoped to see United Global Services waiting. No yellow scarf - no Global Services cart. It was off to the races.    We made it to the gate, just as Group 1 was being called, and sprinted aboard. It was time for wine! We had the same sparkler, as on our previous flight - the Coastal Vines Brut Cuvée sparkling wine.    Settled in, my wife fired up the UA App, to check on our checked luggage. It was being transferred, so should be fine. Though the Baggage Tracking function of the UA App is in beta, it has been almost perfect, since    On this flight, we had the option of a Charcuterie, Fruit & Cheese Plate (my choice), and a Veggie Wrap (my wife’s choice), and both were pretty good, and made for a nice, light lunch - especially as we were dining early in New Orleans.    We had flown quickly back into the clouds, leaving Denver, and really had no views, until just north of Lake Pontchartrain, prior to touch-down.    We pulled into Gate D3 at MSY, and our luggage had made it aboard, and was out onto the carousel fairly quickly. We were off to our hotel on Canal Street, across from the French Quarter.    The flight was very pleasant, and the crew very good. Even the light lunch was about perfect."
Jan 2020,10,Don't Fly United to India on e-visa,Worst elitist staff. would not let my children board on an e-visa to India. Same eVisa I was able to travel to India via United just two days before. Just would not listen. Incompetent staff.
Jan 2020,30,Do not book economy plus,We traveled to Sydney from Cincinnati.  No issues except for passports didn’t exactly match the tickets.  My issue.  Flew a 787-10 to LA and saw economy plus seats which looked great. I had paid extra for the flights to and from Sydney.  Got on the plane in LA (787-9) and when we got to our seats it was basically coach seats with a tiny bit more leg room.  Talked to the attendant and was told that’s just the way it is.  I did see an article today saying that they are upgrading the seats to what I saw on the-10 plane.  Just ask questions about what you paying for.  I depended on the data I received before booking but as you all know agents are not to be trusted.  Get everything documented.
Jan 2020,50,First International/Overseas Flight in Decades,"My last overseas flight was decades ago on a 747. That was amazing at the time. However, boarding the 767, I could already tell this was going to be something special. Walking through the first/business class area in the seating pods I have to say I was envious. Just behind the business class is Economy Plus. We upgraded our flight to Economy Plus which I have to say is well worth it. Don’t think twice on a long flight. Slightly extra room and more recline to start. I was amazed at the 120v outlets, usb outlets, and audio/video system with plenty of entertainment options (music, movies, interactive maps of the route including aircraft information, and a throw back for me, the ability to listen to the cockpit. (Brought me back to my childhood and flying with those plastic tube headphones listening to the cockpit and music. ) Be sure to bring a headset with an audio cord as there is no Bluetooth. If you forget they have complimentary earbuds. On this flight we had two meals served and a snack. All were very good as was the beverage service. Tip of cap to United and our flight crew for wonderful flights on our trip to the Rhine Valley and navigating us through the Friendly Skies!"
Jan 2020,40,very disapoited SCALE NOT RIGHT AT THE NEWARK AIRPORT IN NJ,"I believe it was absurd we scale the luggage 3 times with different scales and one was 40 pounds and other 49 pounds, when my friend Magda got at the checking the luggage the scale show 53 pounds and that was not right, I paid for my friend US$100 for 3 pounds did not exist and after she got in Brazil she said a lot of people on same flight complain about the same thing, Also if the person can bring 100 pounds it should use the limited together right like JFK does. Unite please you should check all the scales in the airport , the rest of the service was good , dinner was great. (JZZUTG CONFIRMATION NUMBER)"
Jan 2020,50,Great flight from Chicago to Cancun and back,"Both flights were very good. We purchased basic economy but being a Mileage Plus members, were able to upgrade to better seats. No delay, no hassle flights. Thank you, United."
Jan 2020,20,Old Planes,"The planse are old and when your trying to watch something your neighbor's elbow turns your volume up changes your movie. They want you watch movies on the APP but that's small, plus not much of a slection!  Chicago international baggage claim was BAD. My wife waited for 30 minutes and I had to wait an additional 25 minutes to get my luggage!! TSW was bad and almost missed our flight."
Jan 2020,50,Smooth traveling,Our return connection in Houston was a little tight having to go through customs but we were able to make it.
Jan 2020,10,Terrible,This was one of the scariest flights I have ever been on. Nothing was smooth about it and on top of that the attendants were rude. Everyone screamed when we landed because it felt as if we were on one wheel about to crash.
Jan 2020,20,Average short haul Int. Flight,"Checkin=poor rating due to online process thru united app. Check in at airport easy at this time of day. Pd for group 2 boarding, got grp 4. 737-900 i think. Overhead bins are getting so far into the aisle, makes it hard for 6’-ers getting in/out of any seat. No policing of carryon bag size, resulting in a couple of short tempers for those boarding later, finding no space. Thankfully flight time was 110min, but taxing (total both ends) added about 30min. Unloading baggage at Tampa was sllloooow."
Jan 2020,40,Good flight back to Dulles n to ny plane,Tiny plane but the service was good and the plane arrived more or less on time. The flight was pretty smooth and the suitcase arrived very quickly. All in all not bad.
Jan 2020,40,Easy flight to South America,"Overall efficient and nice flight to South America. Everything was on time or early, and routes were good."
Jan 2020,40,United is Stepping Up!,"United is clearly recovering from the aches and pains of its merger with Continental Airlines several years ago. Animosity between employees with United and Continental roots has given way to cooperation generating improved passenger experience.    We were able to secure exit row seats with superb legroom, a real plus for a daytime cross country flight. But the inflight personal service level made it a great flight for all seats. Our experienced cockpit crew and favorable winds brought us to our destination way ahead of schedule.    Surprisingly this was not a meal flight, a downer for sure. The copious and kind beverage service did help.    Will definitely include United in my future travel plans."
Jan 2020,10,Overcharged and Terrible Customer Service,Mechanical issues caused us to miss our connection. United customer service was nasty and offered no help whatsoever!
Jan 2020,20,"No Power in the seats, Little Service, My fond memories of exotic flights to HI are quashed.","Here's the good news, the flight wasn't full so four of us took the whole row of 6 seats.  Here's the bad news... It's a 737. This has nothing to do with the MAX which we didn't fly on. But, the 737 is not a good airplane for a 5-6 hour flight, There's nowhere to stand up. The 2 bathrooms for 150 people are so small and the sink in the bathroom is so small that you get water all over your clothes washing your hands. United in it's infinite wisdom has remove power ports from seats in Economy and doesn't have screens to watch IFE or USB ports to power your own device.  I've flown United for 50 years and they used to have the best IFE. Not anymore.  Also, the flight attendants barely walked through the cabin to pick up trash. (They did more on the way home) There was a lot of trash in my seat and I spilled drinks on me several times. -That's on me. I hope though UA can rise to the level of Delta and AA or at least Alaska."
Jan 2020,20,Bad organization of plane,"I did not like flight since there was multiple problems. First to say that I did not have any issues with crew or anything like that. They were pleasant, professional and helpful if asked.  My biggest problem is with how plan was organized. Seats are cramped and I am tall person so my knees rested seat in from. I was cramped and felt like sardine. Also, plane did not have adequate place for carry on luggage. They stared checking out carry on with group 3. This is ridiculous. It just added more time to my travel. They have room for half of passenger luggage."
Jan 2020,10,Double Charging,We flew United as the first hop on a 1 stop flight booked with Aerlingus. Our tickets were all purchased with lugagge and our reciepts clearly showed this.    However United checkin doesnt seem to believe the reciepts and intinery showing that our flights clearly included luggage and insisted we had to pay a massive fee again per bag otherwise they wouldnt take them.    I took the reciepts and on our return made a claim to the airline. They couldnt appoligise more and confirmed that we should never have been charged the fee and couldnt understand why the checkin staff forced us to pay again.
Jan 2020,50,14 hour flights are always unpleasent but United makes this better,"I fly United to China for a reason, they make a difficult flight easier with excellent service from the start of the ticket buying process until disembarking and picking up luggage."
Jan 2020,10,Don't fly United. Hidden charges!!!,Hidden charges for carryon. That's right carryon! I can understand for checked baggage but I can't believe the lengths they have gone to collecting hidden fees.
Jan 2020,30,Pretty average,"So I flew UA when I had to fly home for my fathers funeral a few years ago, and had nothing but praise. Boy have the times changed. This was one of the worst flights ever. The flight attendants seemed to be bickering amongst each other, the food was CRAP. Chicken and waffles, which were soggy, followed by a cookie, followed by a sandwich. We were starving after 7.5 hours. The man in front of me, seemed to have a broken seat because it was on my lap most of the time. The flight home was even worse, all the overhead bins at the rear of the aircraft where we were sitting were full, they made us put our bags in business class, yet we weren’t allowed to access them during the flight! The flight attendants were old and slow, we had even worse food, two ravioli with three pieces of lettuce as a salad. This time I brought snacks with, however because my bag was elsewhere I was still bloody starving. Absolutely ridiculous. Don’t waste your time. Oh and my miles haven’t been credited to my UA mileage plus either."
Jan 2020,20,Don't fly United,United Airlines doesn't even try anymore. On a 6 hour flight from Boston to San Francisco we got 2 lousy snacks and they have no in flight entertainment options.  Stuck on the runway for over an hour with very little communication.
Jan 2020,50,Flights on time and comfortable,"Flights were on time, service was good and notifications of check in , gate changes, use of wifi and boarding where very helpful."
Jan 2020,50,Surprising,"Usually, I wince at the thought of flying UA. Due to circumstances, it was required today. I was shocked to have a great in-flight experience with a friendly cabin attendant. She greeted me, offered her assistance, made sure that I was comfortable, and wished me well. Alas, I'm sure she’ll find a new home when she meets her coworkers. But, I am thankful with today's service."
Jan 2020,50,Superb acts of kindness,"Going on 1 hour of sleep due to two days of travel (flying) my brain wasn't at full capacity. I had been looking up things on my phone and as we were ready to board I put it in a pocket that I normally do not use in my backpack. Needless to say when I got situated in my seat I was going to send a text to a family member letting them know we were boarded and would be home soon. However, when I went to look for my phone it wasn't where it normally would be. Of course I panicked. Captain Brian happen to hear me and jumped right into full bore to try and find my phone along with our wonderful flight attendant. I even went out to look under the seats to see if I could find it. While I was out there my husband looked in the one compartment (which I never use for my phone, but where I absentmindedly placed it) and found it. Captain Brian contacted all the ppl previously searching for it and told them it was found. Our dear flight attendant came out to get me to let me know my husband found it. We always try and fly United as much as possible and this is just another reason to continue to use them. They went above and beyond to try and help me."
Jan 2020,10,United Airlines is a Terrible Airline,"United airlines is known to have a bad reputation.  I am here to validate any preconceived notions.    One of the worst parts of United is their food.  Dinner option on this flight was General Tso's chicken, which tasted worse than panda express.    Everything about United shows an attitude of profit only.  They will cut corners any which way at cost of your comfort or satisfaction.    AVOID if possible, but I know sometimes it is hard if you live in a United hub."
Jan 2020,50,Flight was uneventful,The flight was uneventful. We were able to get on easily and our seats were comfortable. I am 6 foot and there was adequate knee room
Jan 2020,40,Good deal,"I found United often offering good deals from SFO to London, and the booking process is easy. The only thing is that they make you pay extra for the carry luggage. I don't get why they don't include luggage fees for international flights."
Jan 2020,50,Premium Economy from Heathrow,"A year ago I had a chance to fly United Premium Economy before it was officially started and was very happy. When a quick trip to the UK came up I chose to do Premium Economy for both legs and was very happy that I did.    The seats are very comfortable. The service was excellent. In fact, I could not eat all of the food - although I tried. The service was excellent. I thought the FA's were very attentive.    The flight took off a few minutes early and landed early. All in all, it was a very good experience."
Jan 2020,40,No complaints-It is what it is.,Economy but moved us to preferred seating as plane was half empty on way from Logan to San Fran. Very accommodating. No frills. I am diet restricted so the cookies and pretzels were no help. Luckily we ate before the flight and brought our own snacks. Good in flight entertainment.
Jan 2020,30,Food,The dinner that was served on the plane to Houston was inedible. The breakfast that was served in the Polaris Club was excellent.
Jan 2020,40,Oahu Vacation,"Traveling from Buffalo, NY to just about anywhere requires connections. In this case to avoid the 5:45 AM flight we elected to hop across the USA by flying later, but having to add a second connection in SFO. When I booked 2 weeks in advance there were a good number on 1st class seats open and I was told that as I was using the old Global Upgrades as a 1K there was a good chance for upgrades as no other 1K's or Global had booked. Wrong as for all but one connection on the return the 1K status and Global Upgrade did nto come through."
Jan 2020,40,Family Friendly,"I frequently travel with my three year old and have been since she was a baby. United staff are always really helpful and understanding of families traveling. On this specific flight and many others they have offered my child airline wing pins, and lots of extra snacks. Flight attendants were very sweet and kept checking in to see if we were ok and needed any help."
Jan 2020,40,United has improved!,It is clear to us that United has made a conscious and ongoing effort to improve service and on time departures. The last flight taken was from Phoenix to Newark and was even early!
Jan 2020,50,Business class with a lot of privacy,"This is a direct flight from Brussels to Chicago, I flew in business class.  Each seat has its own ‘entrance’, that is, you don’t have to disturb your neighbor if you have a window seat and want to get in/out. You also have a lot of privacy, for me, this was better than flying in first class (intercontinental flights) on some United flights.  Though the privacy is great, it may be a bummer if you travel with multiple persons since you don’t see each other, making it virtually impossible to have a conversation during the flight. Food was as one can expect in business, including the United ice-cream selection. You can also serve yourself some snacks (sweet stuff, but also fruit) during the flight.  How about the seat and space in general: the seat is fine, not exceptionally wide. What I like is that you have sufficient amount of space for your legs/feet when you try to sleep (this is where Lufthansa seats drop the ball…).    Staff was very friendly, was one of my best experiences.  What can still be improved:  1) a place to store your laptop during the flight  2) noise cancellation headphones"
Jan 2020,40,Good internal flight in USA,Good internal flight overall - Check-in was relatively smooth but very expensive check-in baggage! Will use again but without Check-in luggage.
Jan 2020,40,Two good flights...very polite too,"Flew this morning from Austin to Houston then Houston to Nashville. Both flights on time. Both full. Both completely without drama. People and staff very polite, boarding in the correct groups and no dramas over who gets what space in the overhead lockers. Amazing..."
Jan 2020,30,Disappointing flight,"United Airlines Flight 365  SFO-PHL  8:58 am-5:17 pm  Boeing 737-900    My wife and I fly between Philadelphia and San Francisco at least somewhat regularly, and we typically choose United over American for a nonstop flight, since every flight we’ve taken on United on this route has been pleasant, and we cannot say the same for American. On this trip, we had another good flight on United getting to San Francisco, but I was very disappointed with this return flight back to Philadelphia, which may make us less likely to choose United next time.    When we arrived at SFO in the morning, we had two bags to check. Since United has a large hub operation at SFO, it was busy, but well organized, with clear signage for how to use the banks of check-in kiosks to print your own baggage tags and then go to a separate area to drop the bags off once they were tagged. We didn’t have to wait at all to get a kiosk and were on our way quickly.    I was a little surprised that the TSA checkpoint near the F gates at SFO didn’t have a dedicated TSA Precheck lane. Although we were able to bypass much of the long line for purposes of getting our IDs and boarding passes checked because we had Precheck, we were then mixed with everyone else for screening, and given a pass to let the staff members know we didn’t have to take off our shoes or remove electronics or liquids from our bags. This system created a bit of confusion when you got to the belt to put everything through, and it delayed things much more than usual, since we had to wait behind people who were much slower in getting prepared for standard screening.    We had a couple of United Club passes from a United credit card that were going to be expiring soon, so we stopped at the United Club by the F gates. The Club was large and airy, with a relatively bland and somewhat dated décor, but it was a pleasant and quiet place to spend some time before our flight. The breakfast offerings were very similar to what we’ve seen in other United Clubs before: very carb-heavy, with unremarkable mini-bagels and muffins, cereal, oatmeal, yogurt and fruit comprising most of it.    Our flight boarded quickly, and we left the gate about five minutes early. We were in Economy Plus seats in the exit row, which have the best legroom of any row on the aircraft. These Economy Plus seats were also a great deal, since we had received a special offer when we booked our tickets, allowing us to choose any Economy Plus seat on the plane for $22 each, which is a really great deal for a transcontinental flight.    However, the first negative thing I noticed on our flight was how dirty the area around my seat was. For one, the seatback pocket was filled with an abnormally large amount of dirt and crumbs, and there was trash left in there from a previous passenger. There was also a wad of dirty, used napkins sticking out from the pocket at the top of the seat that contains the United magazine and safety card. Finally, sticky fingerprints that looked like they were from the caramel of a stroopwafel were on the back of the seat in front of me. I was pretty shocked at the poor condition of the seat area, since it wasn’t something I’ve experienced before on United. It seemed like absolutely no effort had been made to prepare the cabin before our flight, even though I noted in the United app that the incoming flight had arrived over three hours prior to our flight, giving plenty of time to clean the aircraft.    The service from the flight attendants was fine, but not particularly great. All but one of the flight attendants were pleasant, but I typically find that one bad flight attendant can ruin the entire vibe. The one flight attendant who wasn’t good was simply not friendly and had a habit of banging into passengers sitting on the aisle anytime she walked by, not even just when she had a beverage cart with her. This was unusual, and really odd that she never even bothered to apologize after slamming into my wife’s (and other passengers’) sides.    Early in the flight, we were offered beverages and a snack (choice of stroopwafels, pretzels, or Biscoff cookies) or the option to purchase larger food items. The flight attendants came around at least one or two other times offering water, before a second full beverage service was completed close to the end of the flight. I think this was a generous amount of service for a flight that was about 4.5 hours in the air.    There were power outlets between every two seats, and wifi was available, which I only used to check flight status on the United app. A selection of movies and tv shows are available in the United app to stream on the wifi for free, but we didn’t use them.    In addition to the dirty seat area and mixed service, there was one aspect of aircraft maintenance that was bad. There were two lavatories in the back of the economy cabin, and my wife reported that the one bathroom used had a broken sink, so the entire sink was covered in cellophane to prevent passengers from using it, with a bottle of hand sanitizer left there instead. However, the hand sanitizer they offered was so sticky and cheap that she had to then wait for the other bathroom to open up to be able properly wash her hands. In my opinion, United should not even allow passengers to use a lavatory that isn’t fully functional, and if the aircraft can’t fly without it, they should complete necessary maintenance before sending the plane on a transcontinental flight.    We ultimately arrived at our gate in Philadelphia almost 30 minutes before our scheduled arrival time, which was surprisingly early, especially at a busy time of day at PHL. We were also pleasantly surprised that luggage came out almost immediately once we made it to baggage claim, which was quite surprising based on our usual experiences at PHL. The only problem was that my wife’s hard-shell luggage came out with a huge dent in one of the corners that had not been there before our flight. The luggage had clearly been manhandled at some point that day. We didn’t bother to file a claim for the damage with United, since our luggage manufacturer has a great warranty and was willing to replace it for free.    Overall, our flight from San Francisco to Philadelphia was ok and arrived quite early, which is the most important part. However, I’ve grown accustomed to better service and planes in much better condition on past United flights. I was disappointed that this flight featured a rude flight attendant, a very dirty seat area, and a broken lavatory that shouldn’t have been in service. These are all things I was surprised to find on United after a string of very good flights, so I’ll be more willing to also consider American on this route in the future."
Jan 2020,40,Better than either of the other legs of travel,This was a pleasurable long flight. The staff were excellent at the gate and in the cabin. The legroom was adequate and the seat comfort was very good. I am biased towards Boeing aircraft and this 767 did not disappoint.
Jan 2020,20,About some effort United,First class is horrible. Movies are not on demand so you cannot pause them and they just start like cable tv in the 90s. Food is blah. Miss the hot towels. Seats just ok. Very expensive for what you get
Jan 2020,10,Customer service run-around,"We were flying from India to Phoenix, and our last leg (Chicago to Phoenix) was contracted through United, but ended up being cancelled. We called United several times, and each time they told us that we would receive a hotel voucher if they left us stranded in the airport overnight. When we finally did get into Chicago and spoke to the appropriate desk, they were so rude. They laughed and told us they would not be giving us a hotel voucher as the cancellation was due to weather. When we explained that customer service had told us multiple times that they would, they responded that they had no idea who we spoke to, and we were out of luck.  Additionally, they would not let us check in online before our rescheduled flight, so in order for my husband and I to be able to sit together and be allowed hand baggage, we had to pay $150 for ""upgraded"" seats. We would not have needed to do this before our flight was switched. Needless to say, we will be going out of our way to avoid United in the future."
Jan 2020,50,My flight home UA flight 1677 from Saint Martin,"My flight home on United air was fantastic. I was in first class. LINDA oversaw that section. She was professional, classy polite and knowledgeable. She represented the airline superbly. The pilot and copilot were also as charming. They kept us apprised of everything going on and the flight home was smooth and uneventful. Thank you LINDA!!!! She was always so very gracious to my boys. I recommend United airlines highly"
Jan 2020,50,Great customer service,It is a good company with good customer service. We had some issues with our flight and they tried their best to accommodate us.
Jan 2020,10,Worst airlines and horrible customer support,"Hi,    They booked us on a connecting flight via Canada. Without informing us on the site that you require transit visa. Low and behold we reach the airport and we aren't allowed to board the flight, so we contacted the United desk and airport so that they can accommodate us on another flight and they tell us to contact customer service and we wait for half an hour for the representative to understand the issue only to tell us that we will be charged for the flight change and have to take next days flight due to no mistake of ours. This is blatant harassment due to no fault of ours, other airlines have warnings for such scenarios, but not United. Pathetic support and service. Don't recommend it all."
Jan 2020,30,Not too bad,United does have a lot of flights so you have a good selection of departure times. The seatback monitor had good entertainment options. Wasn't a bad flight this time but the gates are a zoo.
Jan 2020,50,The best flight ever,"So coming back from Orlando Florida we took this United flight. The plane was clean the air hoses was super nice they were friendly like they will talk to you they made you felt like you knew them the pilot was amazing, like I hate going up in the air I hate Landing, I cry going up when in the air how scared I am. But this pilot took his time and it felt as if like he were gradually going into the air and you're not feeling any air sickness your ears are not popping you didn't feel anything, like it was the best flight I ever been on. The pilot got us from Orlando to New Jersey in less time than what they told us, I mean like a whole hour before we were supposed to reach when we landed, it was the, smoothest Landing ever I will forever take United flight again. it was a so relaxing they offer you little snacks and complimentary drinks don't get me wrong some of the alcohol's are expensive but what plane all alcohol not expensive, but for everyone that wants to take this flight this company I suggested all the way I give it five star if I can give it more I would like everyone is super nice and if you fly first class bio means you are getting gourmet salad or whatever they're serving that day with glass plate champagne wine and you're getting your knife and fork. you also get to watch a free movie you get free airpods to put in your ears like they were nice they were giving away stuff and I was looking like I didn't even get that on my other flight.if u don't believe me take this flight United is the best. I wish I add took pic of how first class dine."
Jan 2020,50,great flight,"United is always on time, even arriving early. Attendants are pleasant and friendly. The only thing is having to upgrade the ticket to bring a carry on bag"
Jan 2020,20,Delayed by disorganization,"We had a rain delay broadcast by the captain. She then stated it could be an hour or sooner. They proceeded to let people off the plane,without checking whom left. They never told the people leaving they needed to take personal belongings. She does tell them to stay near the boarding gate.Then 30 minutes later she says we are cleared to leave. Now they can't get everyone on the plane. Because they never checked whom left they have to recheck everyone is on the plane. People moved seats and it was disaster to find out who was on plane. Now we lost our slot to leave and were forced to wait another 1 and 45 minutes. service was non existent. you look down aisles and never stewards. It was worst flight i have ever taken. and I have flown 80 hrs with 10 flights in last 2 months."
Jan 2020,40,Good flight from Dulles to Atlanta,Excellent and quick flight to Atlanta. Slight delay in getting to gate as we had arrived early. No turbulence. Good service but only coffee and a muffin. Noticed they served flight crew a breakfast! Baggage handling great and we were out of airport quick ly.
Jan 2020,40,Great Flight but Still Tight,"No doubt about this flight which left 5 minutes early and arrived 20 minutes early. However, United does not care about anyone over 6 feet tall. Seat spacing in economy is very very tight and makes the flight a tad bit more uncomfortable. I would expect tighter seats with cheap fares but United blows on this feature. Other than that the crew was excellent."
Jan 2020,10,United Basic Economy Is Shameful,"I made a mistake by booking a PM flight instead of an AM flight for my son. I could not change anything on the flight even though I realized my mistake right after. So I had to book another flight to go to Boston thinking that my son could still use the return ticket. Nope, they cancelled the flight. I can use the ticket if I pay a $200 change fee and another $100 fee.    If you don't check a bag and pay $30 you cannot check in online even if you don't have any luggage. What a scam. Yes this is shameful. I have 500k+ miles on united but I swear that they suck so bad that I will never use them again and tell everybody who will listed about my experience with this. Am I pissed, hell ya. This should be illegal."
Jan 2020,20,Ryanair level,Pretty old and not clear planes... unbelievable that you have to pay for everything from the food carriage  Not a good experience and I would say a Ryanair level overall
Jan 2020,40,United International Flight,Our international flights to and from Senegal were comfortable and the flight attendants were outstanding. Much better experience on United international flights than on some domestic flights were seats are far too cramped in economy.
Jan 2020,50,Small airport,We had a great flight on United Airlines. We were flying out of Santa Barbara headed to Denver. The airport is small but has lots of amenities. We were able to grab food for the flight and had plenty of seating at the gate. The cabin crew on the flight were great and the boarding process was seamless! Nice flight.
Jan 2020,30,Pathetic business class,"The seats barley recline, not much more than Economy. The dinner was what most other airlines served on international flights in Economy. United doesn't provide entertainment on many flights and this was one. I have the United App on my tablet and mobile, but could not connect to anything. Very annoying for a 5 1/2 flight."
Jan 2020,50,Smooth and safe,"Clean, friendly service, lots of leg room! The attendants were always willing to help. The flight deck kept the passengers updated about the trip. The trip also seemed shorter than usual!"
Jan 2020,50,Very nice transcontinental flight,"United Airlines Flight 731  PHL-SFO  7:23 am-11:04 am  Boeing 737-900    My wife and I fly between Philadelphia and San Francisco at least somewhat regularly, and we typically have a choice between United and American if we want a nonstop flight. On the last couple of trips, we found that United provided much better service than American on this route, so this time, we made sure to choose United again. We were happy that did, since it was another good experience.    When we arrived at PHL in the morning, we had two bags to check. There are plenty of kiosks to use, given the relatively small size of United’s operation at PHL, and we only had to wait about a minute before one was available. However, this was the second time in a row that we’ve had issues getting our bags checked for a United flight at PHL. Last time, bag tags weren’t printing for anyone, and the staff had to create handwritten tags for every piece of luggage, and this time, once we proceeded through the whole check in process at the kiosk, no tags printed out from ours. The only problem was that staff members were only coming over to take bags from customers once they saw that baggage tags had printed, so it took a while to get someone’s attention to get assistance. However, once one of the managers saw that we were having an issue, she was very nice, and went to another computer to print out our baggage tags herself and apologized for the inconvenience.    Our flight boarded right on time, and although people in later boarding groups always feel the need to crowd the gate, United does a pretty good job of creating orderly lines for each boarding group. We left the gate a few minutes early and took off quickly. We had Economy Plus seats in the exit row, which were wonderful in terms of having great legroom for a transcontinental flight. It was an added bonus that no one else sat with us, so we had the full row of three seats to ourselves to spread out. The Economy Plus seats were also a great deal, since we had received a special offer when we booked our tickets, allowing us to choose any Economy Plus seat on the plane for $22 each, which is a really great deal for a 6.5-hour flight.    Although the weather was fine at both PHL and SFO on the day of our flight, there was a large weather system over the middle of the country, so the flight was turbulent almost immediately, and stayed that way for much of the flight, including several portions where even the flight attendants had to be seated. Although this is certainly outside of the airline’s control, I appreciated how the pilots handled it. They would turn on the fasten seatbelt sign anytime it became turbulent, but they didn’t keep it on forever, and would always turn it off whenever they could. We appreciated that there were still some opportunities to get up and move around or go to the bathroom. The pilots were also communicative throughout the flight about the weather, our arrival time, and other pertinent matters.    The service from the flight attendants was quite good on this flight. They were all professional and pleasant, and did a great job of making the best of the turbulence and still conducting full service as scheduled. We were offered beverages and a snack (choice of stroopwafels or Biscoff cookies) or the option to purchase larger food early in the flight. The flight attendants came around at least 2-3 additional times offering water, and one other time offering coffee, before a second full beverage service was completed close to the end of the flight. I was impressed by how often some sort of beverage was offered. The only thing that could be improved would be to offer the small snack items at least one more time too.    Otherwise, the flight was good. I generally like the interior of the United planes in economy – to me, they usually look relatively fresh and nice, and this plane was clean. The seats become a bit uncomfortable after several hours, but the large amount of space we had made up for it.    The power outlets between seats did not work in our row, which was a little disappointing. Wifi was available, which I only used to check flight status on the United app, and had no issues. A selection of movies and tv shows are available in the United app to stream on the wifi for free, but I didn’t try it.    We landed at SFO about 45 minutes before our scheduled arrival time, which was great, but too early for SFO to accommodate us. The pilots had warned us earlier in the flight that our gate likely wasn’t going to be available when we arrived. We ended up having to park in a section of the airport near the international terminal G gates, and we sat there for another 25 minutes. This has happened to us before when arriving on a United flight at SFO, which is frustrating, and seems to be a frequent issue at this airport. United seems to really max out their gate use with a tight schedule. I did notice that at least there really didn’t seem to be a single gate in any of United’s terminals that was open at the time, so it wasn’t as if they were making us wait when they could have switched our gate to another one that was open. I also appreciated that a couple minutes before it was time for the previous flight at our gate to depart, we taxied over and waited right there for them to leave, allowing us to get into the gate immediately after they pushed back. We still ended up arriving at the gate 20 minutes before our scheduled arrival, which was very nice, and luggage came out relatively quickly once we were at baggage claim.    Overall, this flight was pleasant with great space in the exit row, good service from the crew, and an early arrival, making us happy with this United experience."
Jan 2020,10,never again,"this was easily the most substandard flight that i have ever been on- and that is saying something! from rough takeoffs to even rougher landings every one of our 5 legs ( return flights) was uncomfortable. When i first got in the plane, the toilets were unclean and that was prior to a 15 hour flight to SF. the food was very average and the leg from SF to Mexico asked for us to pay for our food! Beware, anything under 4 hours is non complimentary food. Even the international long haul had pay for your self spirits. we had one meal, one sandwich with a tim tam and occasional water."
Jan 2020,50,Fly United,"It was our 30th wedding anniversary, so we splurged on the seats that lay flat. The flight was outstanding and the flight attendants were incredibly accommodating. I would absolutely fly United again."
Jan 2020,40,A means to an end,"Although some years since I last flew United the services remain all much the same. Adequate everything best describes the event. Still, managed a few movies and landed safely on time which after all is the main thing"
Jan 2020,20,"Wow, that was just awful......","We tried to check in online and check our bags (one free checked bag each with United Explored MileagePlus credit card). Their online system kept charging us to check bags online. Had to wait until we got to IAH to check bags and attendant saw our card, knew we paid for our flight with it, but somehow could not figure out how to NOT charge us. Finally (25 minutes later) the matter was resolved by a helpful supervisor and we were allowed to board.  Wait, you are saying. That doesn't sound all that bad, right? It wasn't, compared to our return flight.  Upon trying to check in online for our return flight on New Years' Eve, the United website said my return reservation had been cancelled because I ""no showed for the IAH to EWR leg."" Called customer service and they said the flight was full & I was essentially SOL.  We take a $110.00 Uber ride from NYC to Newark EWR. Spend 30 minutes with U/A agent (again,""no free checked bags and I don't see a reservation in your name, sir""). Finally found a helpful United agent who basically took the ball and ran with it. ""Good news. I have found a seat for you, in Economy Plus."" I figured they would comp me the $118 upgrade for the hassle they had caused us...wait for it....Nope, my credit card shows a new charge of $236 for two economy plus seats""upgrades"".  Only good thing? I sat next to a very cool guy, U/A pilot (First Officer) R Patel, deadheading on our flight. What a mensch!  Sorry, folks. Time to switch over to Southwest Airlines."
Jan 2020,40,Love the app! Easy check in and on time flights!,"I suggest downloading the United airlines app before traveling, especially internationally. I found it easy to navigate, it gave me updated flight gate info, and allowed me to check and pay for my luggage check. I was traveling alone and this was very helpful. The line to check in from Mexico for my first flight home was very long, I'm glad I arrived early. The airlines provided a snack. The worst experience was navigating customs and security check points when changing planes in Houston. I almost missed my connection because it took an hour to get through customs, recheck my bag, and go through security. I wish I had more time between flights! I feel United should take this into consideration before allowing a connection when making reservations."
Jan 2020,40,Leaving Hawaii-sad,"Crew helped a 6-hour flight be as pleasant as possible with very limited legroom and cabin mobility. Flight crew was efficient, helpful, and friendly. The following leg of the trip from Denver to DesMoines had some winter storm issues and we had to turn back and land in Denver again, but airline was efficient in getting passengers rebooked. Overall best flight experiences I've had in awhile."

Jan 2020,10,Bistro on Board only even on this 16 hour international flight from SFO to Singapore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I flew on UA from SFO to Singapore! I checked in and all of the employees including gate agents are friendly! When I boarded the plane, the IFE was amazing and the window was special dimmable windows since this is a Boeing 787! When we took off, the cabin crew announced that there was Bistro On Board only even this is a 16 hour international flight!!!!!!!!!! This is very very very very very very very very unusual!!!!!! In other words, I had to pay $10 for meals even this flight is 16 hrs!!!!!!! This was my only bad thing I experienced during this whole flight, so other than that the flight was fine!!!!!!!! Please ask me questions if you have any."
Jan 2020,10,The worst experience ever,"Writing for my husband, who is not a complainer--luckily, I am! He was traveling to El Paso with a connection in Chicago. He was due at a customer facility first thing in the morning. United delayed or canceled (not sure) the flight last-minute because the crew needed to sleep. No other crew available?? He eventually got to Chicago but had missed every connection so had to stay the night. He got a hotel voucher, but that was small comfort when he is keeping the customer waiting. Now, he is due home & I am supposed to pick him up in Dayton right about now...except his plane is still sitting in Chicago. I cannot believe how incompetent United is looking at this point. Next time, another airline for sure!"
Jan 2020,40,"Good short flight — left on time , arrived on time",We fly from Denver to Bozeman on an early morning flight which was very full. Although there was a long queue to check in it was well managed by United Ground staff and we checked in and added our bags over within about 10 minutes. The flight was operated on an Airbus 320. The boarding was pretty well managed in groups and we left and arrived on time which is what you really want in a flight. The flight itself took just over 90 minutes and the cabin crew managed to hand out complimentary soft drinks and snacks in that time. Baggage was delivered pretty quickly at Bozeman Airport. My only observation was that the cabin crew looked so bored that they all wished they were somewhere else.
Jan 2020,50,Great flight. Thanks Eunice and her staff!,"Comfortable, easy, on time flight. Eunice, the head flight attendant, did a beautiful job, as did her staff. Even when challenged by a difficult traveler, she responded calmly and seamlessly. Thanks!"
Jan 2020,50,Great Service on Changing a Reservation,I had booked a round trip to go and come back in the same day. Not knowing what time I would finish my meeting a booked a return flight for that 7 that evening. I found myself back at the airport by 3:30. I had received a notice on the United app that the flight was oversold and offered money and a hotel if I would take a flight the next morning. There was a flight leaving at 4:45 that afternoon so I ask if there was a seat available. There was and I was offered the opportunity for $75.00 to change my flight the earlier one. I pointed out to the United agent Beth that I should not have to pay the fee in that the airline stood to gain a seat on a overbooked flight and would not have to pay for someone to stay the night. She agreed and took my  request to her supervisor. Long story short I got on the earlier flight without paying the 75 bucks and someone got to go home that evening that otherwise would not.    Well Done to Beth
Jan 2020,50,Restful United flight,"The service was exceptional for this flight. Every request we had was met very quickly, and the stewards were always friendly and didn't;t tire of requests. What surprised us was there was only paneer as the alternative to meat for lunch. The chicken dish was good but my companion is vegan and couldn't eat it. When the person in fromt of us put back the seat, it was difficult to get out of mine to get to the aisle."
Jan 2020,40,"Easy flight, no hiccups","Flight from Newark, NJ to Las Vegas. Left on time, no delays. Flight was full, but was fine. Flight attendants were nice, friendly & helpful. Had some trouble with the entertainment and my headphones would not work when plugged in, but was not a big deal to me. I was able to use my phone instead of the seat back entertainment. Flight got there earlier than expected."
Jan 2020,50,Good customer service,"Weather had been bad so I appreciated being contacted by UA to change original flight for free. Then while on connection it was overbooked and I enjoyed a $1000 voucher for another flight, plus taxi far to Reagan Int'l, and a $10 food coupon to change to a flight just a few hours later.    And I absolutely LOVE the text notification of what gate I'm coming in on, which one I'm leaving out of and how long it should take me to get there!    Customer service was top notch, keeping us all aware of gates, flight times, and boarding. Much appreciated."
Jan 2020,40,Solid performer.,"I really like flying with United. I have used both business and economy and have been pleased with both. This trip was economy and the service, quality of offering and cleanliness of facilities was very good. I have no complaints with this airline. My connections were all managed smoothly and I arrived on time."
Jan 2020,30,Good,I enjoyed this flight for it was clean and has flatbed in business class but the buttons for light & flight attendants on the remote control doesn’t work. The meal was good but inflight service was ok. Check-in was great.
Jan 2020,30,You can't blame United for the snow delay,"Because of delays at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago due to the rather poor weather, i.e. snowy, our flight was pushed back about an hour. Although the departure time and arrival time were shown to be rescheduled and on-time, they actually weren't due to the delay at OHare. We were on a Airbus A320 (twin-jet) (A320). The aircrew was friendly and efficient. During winter, in the back of your mind, you have to always consider possibilities of problems with the weather."
Jan 2020,10,Food,"The food on this long flight aweful !! Yuck , the dinner was terrible and the breakfast was not fit for an animal , pork noodles and stunk like it was spoiled . I would be ashamed to serve any of the meals . The only good snack of 8.5 hour treck was vanilla bean gelato .The partners of United ANA serve better food and they smile and are Happy to serve their clients"
Jan 2020,30,This time you have to blame the weather,"We got to O'Hare Airport in plenty of time and with only one carry-on, it was a breeze going through TSA and the boarding process. We boarded a Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-700 (twin-jet) (CRJ7). Everything came to a screeching stop, as we took off about 50 minutes late - 0657 hrs., instead of 0607 hrs., due to the weather and the de-icing of the airplane. We ended up arriving 26 minutes late. Oh, well, Mother Nature sure knows how to screw up flight schedules!"
Jan 2020,40,Pretty Good,"The plane left on time, and got in early. The flight crew did a great job of keeping us informed, and a good landing.  An hour and a half flight. Didn't expect steak and lobster, but no peanuts or pretzels, anything.  The flight attendants weren't as friendly as SWA by a long shot. Generally lately the FAs have been better, but not this flight. Perhaps a long day, don't know, but not great."
Jan 2020,50,Surprisingly Great Experience,"We recently flew from London to SFO, with a layover/plane change in Newark. We have flown business class on many different airlines, including United, so we have a sense for what to expect in both the type of amenities (eg lie flat beds) and service. In the past, when flying United, we have had flight attendants that were professional, but not friendly nor overly helpful. In contrast the flight attendants on this flight were fabulous. They were professional, but also friendly, great about accommodating our requests re meal times and my requests for more water and tea throughout the flight (I was fighting a cold). Their service will make me more likely to fly with United when traveling internationally. Oh and the food on this flight was also very good."
Jan 2020,20,Return Flight from Paris,"Why do you pay for “adult” beverages on flights returning to the USA from Paris? Why are all entertainment channels interrupted twice as every announcement is given first in English and then again in French. Why not combine the interruptions and alternate each sentence so we might better learn the other language? And there seemed to be no more room on return flights than on transatlantic flights headed to Europe. Didn’t sleep a wink because of being bumped and or having to breathe stale air. Invest in filters, help combat infectious diseases. The airline industry can do better."
Jan 2020,30,Airlines Could Do Better,"Who said airplane seats should be placed so close together? Who said the attendants should bump you each time they pass by your seat? Is this a part of their training or simply poor design?    Thank God for free entertainment and meals & drinks being included in the airfare.    As transatlantic flights go, United Airlines could do better by simply giving folks a little more space. Happy to have access to movies and television and music."
Jan 2020,50,"Uneventful fkight, the best kind","Uneventful, very nice flight that got in early half an hour early. We had upgraded to Premium Economy Plus and it was well worth it for the 8 hour flight. Kudos to cabin crew, quick, efficient, and professional."
Jan 2020,20,Not a Pleasant Experience,"For such a long flight of about 8 1/2 hours or so, the service United offers their coach customers is horrible!! If you don't pay extra in economy, you're considered so low, you can't even bring a carry on piece of luggage. Only a personal bag that has very severe restrictions also. We were able to bring a carry on as our flight was booked through an Apple package with 2 night hotel stay. Your amenity is a tiny bag of pretzels. I've never seen a bag that small. We were lucky in that we chose a two-seat row in the back of the plane (seat layout is 3-4-3). They seemed a little roomier, and it was nice not to have to crawl over a stranger to get out to walk around, etc. There's 4 rows of those seats on this 777-200 in the back of the plane. I would choose those again in a minute! In sum, it's obvious United bottom line is money, not in the least bit comfort for those that choose a seat other than upgraded economy. For such a long flight, the entertainment amenity was horrible. There wasn't a movie that was less than 10 years old, I believe. Apollo? Home Alone? Come on. You are nothing but cattle is what my impression was. I would NOT fly United again if I did not have to, but they are the only airline that has this non-stop flight to Honolulu. Again, the two seat row we had was a plus, so I base my star reviews on that. Pitch is 31"" on the other economy seats, and I felt these were a bit roomier in that regard."
Jan 2020,30,Food choices Blaah,"I found the flight good. In regards to pilots, crew.. It's the drop off to economy. Really small seats and the food and beverage service really lacking choices. No hot food, and not very creative in going to a Caribbean country with some great food choices. Come on United offer some tastes of the destination"
Jan 2020,50,We’ve been United 10k people for years,"As a short person whose feet almost never touched ground before lie flat seats, having that availability is priceless. Service is excellent. I love to fly."
Jan 2020,50,Excellent flight.,"The flight was on time, the staff very friendly and the service inside very good,we highly recommend this airline."
Jan 2020,40,Great way to get to a vacation!,"The check in wash fast and efficient. The agent set up a wheel chair to transfer planes in Chicago since our transfer time was short and I am nursing a sore knee. The wheel chair was plane side and efficient. Since I am 6' 5"" and 270 lbs the Premium Economy seat adds the leg room and width to make the Embrailier 175 plane comfortable. From Chicago to Key West our 737 Economy Extra Seats were great! Key West Airport has ramps to deplane and a short walk to the terminal. A great place to go."
Jan 2020,10,United airlines mileage plus program,"I got a mileage plus # then got the credit card i got issued a diferent # so i called ask if they would transfer miles from the one account to the credit card account they said no problem we will do,i was asked for address, telefono #, new account, # old account # email information,last flight in details i answered that i did not remember the date since i fly every week in various airlines but i did remember it was from Houston to Mexico...so now we had to go in the security questions since i did not remember ever detail of a flight i did two months ago ofcourse when asked security questions i couldn't remember the answers since you have no chose they set questions and choices of answer so if something you don't relate you MUST came something up to continue otherwise your stuck ( at this time i have 16 minutes on phone call now i am with a supervisor)i have sing out off old account so i can sing into new account so more problems i was just following direccions after 20 minutes i realized that this was going to go for indefinite time since now they send a link a i have to answer all new questionnaire so i can rescue my miles at this point i realized that i can transfer $40000.00 dollars in 3 minutes tops and to get some miles from United airlines mileage plus i have to WASTE precious time from working and making money just because the have such an Dysfunctional sisten !! I decided to hang up lose my miles and just make more money and not look back on a system that is not customer friendly!"
Jan 2020,50,Trips to and From Orlando from Cleveland,"Great flight., I upgraded my seat to get a bit more leg room. We left early and arrived in Orlando early. Luggage delivery was prompt. Service on flight was fine (not real perks any more). Everyone was very polite and professional. On-board entertainment is a nice feature and I watched a move most of the flight."
Jan 2020,50,Great Customer Service,"5 stars for amazing customer service. I left an item on the plane and only realized it half an hour after deplaning. I had a short layover and a connecting flight at the opposite end of the terminal. Once I realized, I returned to the gate where we landed at DEN and the gentleman at the gate helped me track down the plane, which already left the gate, track down my left item, and held on to it until my return a week later when I had a connecting flight at DEN on my way to TYS since I couldn’t wait for it due to a connecting flight. This United Airlines employee made a very stressful start to a vacation a very pleasant experience."
Jan 2020,40,"Great Flight and crew, Food was so so",United did a great job in all aspects except the food. It was a full fiight and they ran out of some food selections so we had no choice. Fortunately we had a big breakfast so it was easy to pass on the menu items that didn't appeal to us. The free wine and beer in economy were good. I like United and the Boeing 777 we flew on.
Jan 2020,30,Tight squeeze,"United economy is just not a great product, fine for 2-3 hour flights, but more than three hours it is to cheap! How they get away with that in America is beyond me, I am not a Big guy, but even for me it was tight"
Jan 2020,50,Good service,Had a Friday flight back to San Francisco and was very pleased. Much more pleasant than flight to Kona. Getting on board was a little slow but we had seats 2 A and B and enjoyed having the video available. Our flight attendant was very personable and attentive. Always seemed ready to offer a drink refill or snack. The in-flight meal (ravioli) was warm and tasty. The flight was a little bumpy but we arrived at SFO nearly 20 minutes early (hurrah). Our checked luggage arrived within 15 minutes of us reaching gate. Definitely excellent service on this trip.
Jan 2020,10,Really bad,"Alcaholic beverages were supposedly not free. I orderd one, as soon as I was drinking, another flight attended asked me in a weird way: where did you get that? Like I stole/took it from somewhere. On which another flight attended told her she brought me the drink. Its usual to get passed by with foods and smelling meals whitout knowing how to get some yourself. Also the flight attendeds were very rude, not making eye contact or not even responding to you. If you dont like the job just quit already. I can go on for pages. Im not wasting my time, worst flight experience ever."
Jan 2020,40,Reliable and Good Routes,"Been using this airline for years, always reliable and will make fair compensation when things are in their control.    Tons of routes to the places I like to go, will continue to use them."
Jan 2020,30,United transatlantic,"Nice newer 777 , you get what you pay for....entertainment quit working, crew kept making promises they never got around to. Just say no instead of yes ,but when we have time...17 hour trip is too long with kids. Will fly nonstop with Norwegian next time around. But we got there and back. Lufthansa flying west, much better xperience on an old 747. More leg room and better service. Go european rather than us airline, much better service. Crew on United need to find a different line of work...."
Jan 2020,50,United Polaris Class is a must for Long Hauls,"It’s almost 17 hours from Houston to Sydney (and since you arrive in the morning), United’s new Polaris Class is essential to ensure you are ready when you arrive in Australia. The seats are spacious and lie flat. A 6’4” person can rest and sleep comfortably. Ask for the pajamas when you board in order to get out of clothes that you are not us3d to sleep in. The food was fine but the service from The United Stewart’s was great - friendly but not to stuffy."
Jan 2020,50,We decided on basic economy for a quick overnight trip,"We had ample leg room and were actually able to put our belongings into the overhead.. They are very strict about one small bag, mine was the exact dimensions. They had food or sale and offered a snack and drinks."
Jan 2020,30,Losing Stitus,"Seats uncomfortable, my cushion was worn, and there was a ridge about 8 inches from the back, causing abnormal pressure on my sit bones and coccyx. The power outlet was broken. There was no window in my row. All in all, not a great flight. We left 10 minutes late, arrived on time. Luggage took 25 minutes to come out. Snack consisted of a bag with 18-0 mini pretzels. Limited to one snack! We paid extra for economy-plus----well worth it for the extra legroom."
Jan 2020,20,"Unreliable, bad customer service, delays, etc...","total of 6 hours waiting in the airplane that never left. Pilot timed out, other airlines where leaving but we were told it was due to weather conditions (my eye). Arrived at destination with 36 hours delay... for a 2:30 duration flight."
Jan 2020,10,Traveler,Upon arrival at the airport to check in to a flight I checked my golf bag and I had a smaller suit case that I was going to carry on. After checking in my golf bag I was walking away and the desk attendant said that I had to check my walk on bag. I asked why and she said I purchase a basic economy ticket and I was not allowed to carry on my bag. I found this policy ridiculous and just another way of taking advantage of people.  Never again United
Jan 2020,10,17.5 hour flight from he--,"We would never fly this airline again if it were free. The food terrible , flight service rude.Coming back we flew Ana their parnters in flight , all flight service smiles, respectful happy to serve , americans need to take lessons from them on customer service and the food"
Jan 2020,30,united airlines flight form dominican republic,"an O.K. flight, what you would expect from a U.S. domestic flight. I had a snack box that was O.K., the rest of the food options didn't sound so good"
Jan 2020,40,no problems therefore a great flight,"I flew basic economy. Nothing to say it was fine. Granted like all airlines today, the seats are a bit small but acceptable.    On the way home, I asked if there were any seats closer to the front. I was in row 32 and managed to get row 12. I gave up an aisle seat to take a middle seat but it was worth it as I had to get off the plane as quick as possible to catch a shuttle.  I don't regret it. There was lots more room between me and the seat in front."
Jan 2020,50,booked flight from jfk to sfo,"i had booking flight for sfo with united airlines. called on united airline number+1 800-680-2429 enjoyed fast booking, no waiting. i recommended my all friend to book at this number for better customer service"
Jan 2020,10,Worst flight experience I've had,"I've flown over 70 times (yes, I keep a journal of flights) and this was the worst travel experience I've ever had. The United flights were from OKC to O'Hare to Fort Wayne. It was supposed to be a 6-hour itinerary with the layover. It turned into a 14-hour ordeal (not including travel time to the OKC airport and to my mother's home in Fort Wayne. We left the house at 5am and didn't get in to my mother's house until 11:pm. All in all, there were 4 flight delays (moving the departure times), 3 different excuses for late flights, 3 gate changes, and one piece of damaged luggage. One of the excuses was ""snow"" at O'Hare....well, it was a dusting at best. I wrote United customer service and explained the whole fiasco. They put the blame elsewhere and sent a $50 voucher for a future flight, but it appears to be a major pain to jump through all the hoops to use it. In general, what was the most frustrating was the general lack of concern, empathy, or assistance by employees in Oklahoma City, Chicago, and Fort Wayne, so clearly the problem is systemic. It seems every time I fly United there is an issue. I will only fly United in the future if there are no other options. I'm willing to pay more to use another airline."
Jan 2020,50,Great Flight,Flight left on time very smooth took our overhead luggage beneath no charge in flight service was wonderful. Arrived on time to start our vacation
Jan 2020,20,Bad Experience - United,"Seats were worn out and uncomfortable. The flight attendant was rude and short with every one. He rushed through the meal service so that he had personal time to ignore everyone and flip through his phone. Bathroom was disgusting. The meal itself was substandard - it was small, undesirable and pretty much awful. The nuts and diet coke were good."
Jan 2020,30,Another good flights on United,"I flew from Phoenix the Denver on 31 December 2019 and returned on 5 January 2020. Both flights were comfortable and on-time as I have come to expect from United Airlines. There was nothing special about the flights, service, and customer support so i gave a rating of 3 stars (as expected). Since there was nothing special about all aspects of the flight I could not justify a higher rating. I was surprised that the air fare was actually cheaper than other airlines and generally United's service is slightly better."
Jan 2020,10,Don't Use Points for First/Business,"Made the mistake of using my hard earned points for a first/business class ticket on United. What a horror. First there was something unrecognizable in the front pouch. Second, no foot rest. Third the head rest was broken. Fourth the outlet for the phone - unusable. Let's not forget no screen. So other than a wide seat and legroom - both of which I do not need - this was a totsl waste of points. The attendant came to me and offered me 10,000 points, not nearly what I used. Be warned.."
Jan 2020,50,Amazing way to fly,"I will never again fly any other way international. For just a few dollars more than regular economy you basically get first class seats and service. United Premium Economy on the international route had plush leather seats which reclined and had a lazy boy type foot rest, a giant screen for entertainment, free drinks, upgraded food menu, a free travel pouch with socks, flip flops, ear muffs, eye muffs, noise cancelling earphones, our own section on the aircraft just like first class, it was an amazing way to fly and I will never go back to regular economy again."
Jan 2020,30,Continental Director,My flight was from HK via Japan Narita and Denver to Colorado Springs. Due to the weather conditions in Japan my flight was delayed both in Hong Kong and also in Narita for more than two hours each.  When I arrived at Denver Airport. The immigration clearance was relatively smooth but was disappointed by the luggage arrival arrangement. There were four conveyor belts in the arrival area but only one was operating. At the time of my arrival there were two other airlines from London and and another international detonation also arrived. All three airlines were using the same conveyor belt for their luggage arrival. So it is no wonder that it took a long time and created a chaotic scene for three plane load of passengers all crowded into one belt. By the time I claimed my luggage and rechecked in for COS. I have to literally run all the way to the next gate for my connecting flight. Before I board my plane i checked with the agent to see if they can ensure that my luggage made it but it was not that helpful. When I arrived at COS my luggage did not arrive and I could not have my winter jacket to keep me warm nor my GPS to help me find my way to the airport. All that I was given was a toilette kit. Though they managed to get my luggage back to me after six hours I arrived at the hotel.  For any travelers using the Denver Airport. Please have a longer time for connecting flight.
Jan 2020,10,Flight protection,"I bought a ticket and insurance on my flight, when I went to change the name on the flight or ask for. Refund it was such a hassle and nothing was able to be done. I bought insurance for a reason I had a family emergency and I was not able to cancel my flight or even the name on the flight or get a refund. What is the point of getting flight insurance if I can’t change it or get it refunded. Saying there is nothing they could do which is beyond insane to me. I don’t recommend them."
Jan 2020,40,Sardine packaging with a convenient timetable,"Welcome to No Frills travel in the 2020s. Minimal seating space, no free food enroute (half can of juice & a bag of pretzels is not food). Small airport in a small city that surprisingly is served by one major domestic carrier. Never mind that they code share or transfer luggage with few international carriers - meaning, do allow ample connection time and be prepared to schlep your bags to the other counter and go through another security check."
Jan 2020,40,Delayed flight but made up the time,We were originally told that our flight was delayed due to a delayed arrival. We did board a few minutes late but the flight made up time on our flight north and arrived at almost the original promised time.
Jan 2020,40,"With our United Explorer credit card, we get free bags","Everything flowed very well and the flight was flawless except for access to the onboard exclusive movies that were advertised. I could access their Wi-Fi and some old movies, but the new movies that were highlighted in their magazine could not be found."
Jan 2020,50,Long flight,Direct to Cle staff was attentive n very pleasant. Actually got in 15 min early. They made a long flight very pleasant and comfortable. Would highly recommend over American. In time all parts of flight there and back. Thank you.
Jan 2020,30,Friendly UA staff on a full flight to San Juan,I found the regular economy seating pretty confining and uncomfortable. I am reluctant to take long flights because of it. We did get economy+ seating on one flight leg and I thought I was living large. Great UA check-in and flight staff. Usual call for folks to check their carry-ons due to lack of overhead space. Movie selection on personal consoles were fine though hard for me to view comfortably when the seat in front was laid back. Flight transfer point was changed from Newark to Dulles but didn't pose a problem. Flight arrival/departure delays were minimal.
Jan 2020,40,Vacation,We were not able to pick our seats when making reservations so my husband and I were in separate area's on the plane which did not make my husband happy. The United crew was pleasant however with an overbooked flight there was nothing that they could do to seat us together. The flight was uneventful and we made it to Ft.Lauderdale on time. If you want choices fly first class.
Jan 2020,40,Easy Long Flight,"I fully recommend paying a small surcharge to sit near the front of economy. This is a day flight so it makes it harder for this non-sleeper to get some rest. United has a very big selection of movies to watch. I watched four movies, enjoyed the meals and was so relaxed I was able to take a long nap. I’m was very happy with the flight!"
Jan 2020,40,Easy and Friendly Flight from Cancun to Newark,"A bit delayed, but that is the fault of the weather, not the airline. Premium Economy is more expensive but definitely worth the price for extra legroom and closer to the front of the cabin. Professional and friendly flight crew. Pilot was very apologetic because we landed and then had no gate to get to. It wasn't that bad, but he was so nice and professional about it. Seemed like the people around us were all fine with the delay.  Take this same flight each time we visit Cancun. I got home safely. That is what counts!"
Jan 2020,30,Why are we paying more for less?,I am not much for flying anymore! Lets just get there A to B and back from B to A.  Weather at least was good.
Jan 2020,20,"First Class ticked, third rate service","When the airlines went to the hub system of routing it was good for the airlines but a greater stress on the consumer. This is something we have had to adjust to where a 3 or 4 hour flight now becomes an all day affair. Flying first class should make it a little more bearable, but when a flight is delayed and you miss your connection it seems airlines would make a little more effort to ensure the comfort of the customer. Apparently United puts more weight on numbers than the individual! Due to a mechanical failure on a late flight the connection was missed and a transfer to another airline was suggested. That airline wanted to charge for bags at the rate of $100 and late boarding fee. For a frequent business traveler this may have just been a glitch, but for an infrequent leisure traveler it was a nightmare. Ultimately, the return home was a day late and just a bad memory. Flying these days is hard enough but a first class ticket doesn't necessarily mean first class service."
Jan 2020,50,Excellent staff!,"We were thrilled to be able to fly directly from DEN to London and back. Both flights had very good flight attendants who were friendly, professional AND had a good sense of humor!"
Jan 2020,40,Dulles to Geneva and return,"Full flight to Geneva but flight on time, in flight food and beverage and food OK,    To check in on return flight in Geneva is a mess if you have ski gear. You check in at a kiosk that has a line, then have an agent check you passport and take your luggage, ski gear you take to another location for security check, then to security screening, which is very efficient.    Then I had move quickly to the departure gate, stopping only to purchase a bottle of water.    Finally arrive at the departure gate only to be met with an interrogation by some person concerning what I had purchased at the airport. How irritating - and understand I am no spring chicken in the age arena.    Thank goodness the departure gate agent noticed what was occurring, and held the shuttle to the airplane until the silliness was over.    Needless to say, I do not have a good opinion of the Geneva airport.    Flight back to Dulles was uneventful.    until"
Jan 2020,40,Brad,"The only reason I didn’t give a ‘5’ is because I missed a flight by literally 2 minutes because my previous flight had been delayed by no fault of my own, and the flight I missed, I felt, could’ve and should’ve been made aware and/or waited the 4 minutes it would’ve taken for me to hop off and on the planes, respectively. That being said, the airline staff was more then helpful and accommodating when it came to hotel and food vouchers for the night as I had to stay in Houston overnight for what should’ve been a 5 minute layover. All in all I was pleased with my experience being my first of many United Airlines flights. Thanks!"
Jan 2020,40,Family Urgency,"We had to go home for a hospitalized elderly family member. United Airlines took great care of my wife & I. I requested wheel chair assistant. They did a great job assisting my wife. She’s unable to walk long distance. She’s having a lot of health issues. They were right there at our connecting gate transporting my wife to our next flight. We only had 45 minutes to go from B terminal to T terminal. The attendant got us there with minutes to spare. I wanted to thank everyone in all 3 cities for an excellent job. San Antonio, Houston & Mobile."
Jan 2020,50,Great flights from Appleton to New Orleans (via ORD),United has consistently provided safe on-time flights. The United Airlines staff is competent and kind.
Jan 2020,10,Terrible service. United,"United has the worst customer service out of any of the airlines I have used. Agents at the airport lean against poles, scrolling on their phones and seem annoyed when you ask a question....rude.  Plane was half full after I had to pay extra in order to have seats reserved. Tried to sit in a row alone and was told I had to go sit in the seat I paid extra for which was a full row and tight. The plane was literally half empty. Never again....United needs new leadership."
Jan 2020,30,Coming back home,"This flight was much better then one day earlier. The plane was on time. Even it was full of passengers, we were able to take on board all our small luggage.  It was the same crew we've met a day before.  Nice weather kept my spirit high. Because of our flight to the West, there was a very long sunset, making our flight very colorful.  We've landed in Chicago earlier then scheduled.  I've like it the most.  RomanP"
Jan 2020,20,Late Flight,"It should be short flight of my business trip. Unfortunately, we were waiting 90 minutes at O'Hare late because, per announcement, airport was waiting for...crew!!!  Then we were waiting, so the plane will be warmed up.  The flight by itself went well. It looks like the pilot was ""speeding"" reducing the late minutes at the destination.  One crazy thing was, that before entering the cabin we were asked to leave all luggage, including the small one which fits into the upper storage.  There was less than half of seats empty. Nobody knew why we had to do this.  Other than that, it was typical short flight: some snacks, drinks and...landing.    RomanP"
Jan 2020,50,CLE to Cabo (through Houston),"There was snow the night before so we actually booked a room at the airport hotel so we did not need to drive in the morning. Instead of United letting us know the night before that our crew landed late and we would not be able to fly us for 2.5 hours later, they let us know upon check in. We missed our connection and had to re-book the next available flight in Houston. Had they told us the night before, we could have re-booked through Chicago or Denver with no delay.    When traveling United with a connection in Chicago, Denver, Newark, or Houston, it is wise to ensure that you are traveling the first flight option on that day. We have flown to Mexico five times in the last year and the 4 of the 5 flights were delayed which caused us to re-book connecting flights."
Jan 2020,10,Full Body Contact Seat Neighbor,At times United uses a 777 with a 3-4-3 seat configuration for domestic and international flights. Those economy seats are 1 to 2 aches slimmer than their regular seats which doesn't sound like a lot but make world of a difference if you have a seat neighbor who is not super slim or petite. I was flying on a red eye and my neighbor was a bigger gentlemen - we touched from shoulder to knee on the entire flight and that was even with me leaning into the aisle.  Beware of any United flights with this seat configuration- it has super slim seats and virtually no recline. When you use their app to book a flight you can click on seats to see what seats are open and at the same time you see the seat configuration.
Jan 2020,30,Flight,We left Sioux Falls over an hour late & had to run to get out connecting flight in Chicago to Cancun.
Jan 2020,10,No customer service at all except to take money,"Flight delayed due to problems with plane and as a result I missed my 11 pm connection.    Someone was supposed to meet me at gate to rush me to the connection — no one was there    Arrived at gate for connection, plane was there delayed they would not let me board    At 11pm no one at airport to assist.    Took flight next day at 4 pm, luggage lost    Again no assistance, nothing    Once they take your money, they don’t care."
Jan 2020,10,president,"horrible every time. united is consistently worst airline. pilots asking for peoples patience and offering apoligies. overselling seats so people get bumped. and now charging for the right to choose a seat, when almost none are left. charging for a carry on, when they run out of space for them anyway. my 2nd grader could do a better job on these logistics."
Jan 2020,10,United Employees create unnecessary stress,"I had the displeasure of flying United Airlines recently back and forth to care for my sick father. I booked with United as they did have many choices of flights to my destination. But after paying full price for each ticket, i was always designated to board last, in group 4. What I noticed is that they let everyone board until only half the plane is full and then without even checking whether full or not, start confiscating carry ons, and saying the overhead compartments are full. But once on the plane, one soon realizes that no, there is actually plenty of room. Given that I paid full price for my ticket, I am offended that they let everyone on with multiple carry ons, them pick on me and tell me I can have none! I found this particularly stressful on my last few trips, because after my dad had a bad fall, I immediately got on a plane to rush to the hospital and did not want to check a bag. I had to beg and cry, they finally relented, only for me to find half the carry on space still empty! On a return trip after my dad passed away, I literally had my fathers entire life of documents and sentimental items in my carry on, again given last group 4 to board, and again I had to cry and beg to be allowed to take on my one carry on, after they allowed everyone to board with as many as they wanted. So I do have a United credit card, and actually travel often for leisure, but don’t travel for business anymore. I simply do not understand why I am always last to board. OK I have no status, but I am still entitled to my one carry on. United should get their act together, and have rules that they apply fairly. One carry on regardless of ticket class, status, or urge to discriminate. The cabin crew are just being lazy or are they following unspoken rules? Either way I hate flying United. I flew enough times recently to know its not a one off situation."
Jan 2020,20,UNITED 9hr flights and NO Complimentary FOOD ????,Was accompanying a friend to Hawaii for a business trip. Was excited to go back to the islands. Had flown many times when worked with Continental. Was looking forward to seeing what had changed with UNITED. Unfortunately it was NOT A GOOD CHANGE. I was embarrassed to know that service seemed worse than ever. On a 9 hr flight there was no complimentary food???? The flight attendants were scarce. I will pay better attention next time!
Jan 2020,20,United airlines,Upon arriving in Chicago we had approx 45 minutes until our flight left at 7:40 CST. From 7:00 until 12:00 the flight kept getting delayed. The gates changed every time there was a delay so we were running to different gates all over the airport. There was NO United staff personnel to explain what was going on. We finally rented a car and got home an hour and a half before the flight finally made it to South Bend IN.  Because of the HUGE inconvenience United is refunding us 46.00. We will definitely be looking at other airlines for our next trip.
Jan 2020,20,Polaris plane should be junked,I’ve flown on United to/from China for 15 years in both coach & business/first.  The new Polaris plane is the most uncomfortable plane in history. The business/first seat forces your body into strange positions. I began to have leg cramps. Your legs below your thighs can’t move or they bang into the tray table. I’m very thin. I can’t image a heavy person sitting in this seats.  To get into the seat from the aisle a person has to be a contortionist.  The food was horrible. The stewards were bored and not congenial (they had been united stewards).  I plan to switch to another Star Alliance carrier. No more United for me!
Jan 2020,50,Family Vacation,"We decided that for such a long journey that we would do it comfort. Everything went well. Food, seats, amenities, and the trip was great. If we were to do this again we would definitely spend the extra to enjoy the trip as well as the vacation. The flight both ways left on time and came in early. The service was very good."
Jan 2020,50,"United is Excellent, but don't use AIR2SEA","I recently booked a flight with United for my wife and I and I decided to use an agency called AIR 2 SEA that would guarantee me to get to my destination (from New Jersey to Florida) for a fee of $200.00. They requested my original United flight itinerary, flight confirmation # and cruise information (we flew to Tampa, Fl to make a visit and then take a cruise).  Air 2 Sea some how re-booked our United flight, changed our seats (now not sitting together) and used their credit card instead of my United Milage Plus credit card. My United privilege of “one bag free per passenger” was denied since they used their own credit card, thus I had to pay for my bags. My wife is handicapped and needs to sit on an isle seat, they put her in a window seat, and changed my seat that was originally next to her’s. I had to pay for upgraded seats to get my wife & I an isle seat.  They caused a lot of havoc and extra cost for my vacation trip. WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN!"
Jan 2020,50,Trip out of Grand Rapids on United was excellent,"I was impressed the minute we got into the airport and discovered that our airline had no wait line, the staff checked in our luggage and on the entire trip our pilot kept us informed about our flight into San Juan, which was experiencing earthquakes on the island. The plane ride was comfortable, the attendants were ok. Our luggage was waiting for us when we were finally able to land in San Juan. Great flight. I was really happy"
Jan 2020,10,Worst Airline Ever,Was the worst flight I have ever taken. The plane was very small because it wasn’t the plane we were supposed to have. I was put next to a guy 6 foot tall about 350 LBS. I am a pretty big guy myself. I asked for a different seat stewardess ignored me. I finally got a different seat but it was the one all the way at the rear and would not recline. The seats are so small now you can barely fit in them. The tray table would not come down level because it would hit my legs. My drink spilled all over myself. Had to smell the toilet the whole way. I would avoid this airline if I were you. Run the other way
Jan 2020,50,Relaxing ride back from paradise,"As long as we had to leave Beautiful Aruba, we made it less painful by flying first class, and our attendants were spectacular, particularly Ms. Debbie Broadbent, who was attentive, friendly, and professional. The pilots were informative, and made our silky smooth flight a pleasure. The aircraft was spotless, and we arrived a few minutes early, and our baggage delivered surprisingly fast. Very pleasing experience!!"
Jan 2020,50,Unite me with my destination,I tend to fly this route a good amount and the reverse route too. While many people do not like United I do. My home airport is Newark. I can get to so many places from there via United. I have a program with them where I can get points. They are definitely my top choice when it comes to flying. Despite being the daughter of a father who was a former Pilot for American Airlines. Another airline that I like that most people don't.
Jan 2020,50,surprising coach,i was very surprised to be getting an in-flight movie in coach on my flight. seats are a little roomier than expected and they recline nicely.
Jan 2020,40,Some good - some bad,"Having had problems with United on domestic flights - delays, cancellations, mechanical problems... - I was a bit leery of being booked internationally on United, but they came through very well with a good experience. The extra leg room was worth it, and the in flight entertainment was good, The service was good."
Jan 2020,50,Great service on United,"My flight from Kalamazoo, MI was hectic, though it turned out great in the end. It had snowed the night before, and the gate attendants were trying to defrost the airplane and clear the runway. We were going on the first leg of our trip back to Seattle, from Kalamazoo to Chicago O'Hare. They eventually told us that 13 of us would have to get off of the plane, and they would take you in a shuttle + you get 800 dollars per person. We are a four person family, and so we got in line for the 3200 dollars in total. When we were at the front of the line, the gate attendants asked if anyone would agree to be re-booked completely from the flight for 2000 dollars per person. As we were 2nd in line, we were more than happy to take the 8000 dollars in total. When we went back to Seattle 2 days later, 3 of the 4 of us had been re-booked on the economy plus, with the extra legroom. I think that in general, all of the gate employees should get raises for stressful situations like this one. They were very accomodating, and remained calm almost the whole way through. Thank you United Airlines!"
Jan 2020,10,One of the worst,I fly about 125 flights with UA a year so I am 1K with United. I would not chose to have status with United.  They are one of the worst. The planes are dirty cramped and not well maintained. The “snacks” are stale pretzels. The bathrooms often are not in full functioning order. Delta is twice the airline that United is. If you are looking for a good airline to serve your business travel need I would not recommend United.
Jan 2020,50,Winter Flying to Maui above a Cloudy Pacific Ocean,"Late departure from ABQ because of icy wings. The pilot was straight forward about his impatience with ABQ ground crew being late to work. Despite the 45 minute delay, the pilots made up time to SFO to Allow travelers to make their Maui connections — with a little hurry up to the gate. Lots of empty seats allow everyone to spread out and enjoy the spaciousness — even in economy section.    Another departure delay at SFO. Lots of flights delayed because of weather. Pilots very vocal keeping passengers updated. Always helpful to hear from pilots narrating — “blow by blow.” Nobody missed the connection from other flights.    The five-hour flight to Kahului started out smooth - for the first third of the trek. Lots of winter weather brought mild to moderate turbulence to a Pitt half way point then came more and rougher turbulence.    Service continued, access to restrooms available, and the pilot kept the passengers updated and reassured during the entire flight. Always helpful in staying calm to hear the pilot’s voice calm and authoritative. Got the Maui no ka oi on time, luggage unloaded timely. Winter Traveling is typically a rough ride to Hawaii nei. Lots of fee United movies on Gogo app., food mainly snacks. Blankets provided, cabins comfortable. Suggested to bring your own food, fruits if you want healthy moderate calorie meals.  United seems to have trained customer services staff to be more customer friendly. Still charge too much for luggage — for folks on limited budget  No carry on in economy. A hui hou."
Jan 2020,20,Only if you have to,Grumpy cabin staff. Pay for meals and booze. An entertainment system that you have to access via an app that you need to download before boarding. No Thanks!
Jan 2020,30,Don't Pay for the Upgrade to Economy Plus,"I was flying from Calgary to San Francisco to meet my husband. We paid $90 for the economy plus seating (extra leg room) and so I wouldn't have to pay for my bag either. Because I could not check in on my phone I did not get a seat in the front row, so no extra leg room for me. The staff were all very kind but it was disappointing that we paid for an ""upgrade"" and I was never allowed to use it."
Jan 2020,30,"It Was a Safe Flight After All, Which Matters Most","It was, overall, a pretty uneventful trip, thankfully, on the 1st day of January 2020, and a safe one at that. We had a stop over in Denver Colorado, and then we took UA815 to LAX. You probably seldom have flights nowadays without connections especially if you're from the East Coast, but who really knows for sure? We took the 6pm-ish flight from LGA, and landed in LAX just in time for midnight. No delays. Staff were all friendly and helpful.    We bought our tickets as a package from a third party provider, and I think there's always a problem from here. We didn't have wheelchair assistance when we landed in Denver, and LAX until we had to ask for such from the staff who were helpful. Something is wrong here, as we have indicated that we need wheelchair assistance when we bought the tickets, and the systems of those involve here didn't catch on this. I understand it's not United Airlines' problem, as I was made to understand. This is the BIG disappointing part of this trip, still. Wheelchair is largely provided by the airport, or another entity separate from United, as what the staff explained to us."
Jan 2020,50,Relaxing,Nice flight. Delayed takeoff but made up time aloft. Very nice stewardesses. Good choice of freebies. Two types of cookies and pretzels along with beverage.
Jan 2020,10,Economist,"Horrible customer service. Indeed, almost nonexistent. 45 minute waits on the phone without a callback option. 3 hour wait at airport. Ended up on Amtrak! Train is better than United!!!"
Jan 2020,50,"Great service, punctual","Taking a family vacation to Florida. Impressed by the service of the flight attendants, on time arrival and variety of snacks/entertainment offered on board. The agent was very accommodating to us with our toddler."
Jan 2020,10,Terrible company,We had to go back to the gate TWICE from the runway because the “luggage was not balanced properly.” TWICE. How does that even happen once for a company that deals with planes and luggage all day long??
Jan 2020,40,New Adventures,"Great weather, nice flights and good service. What more could someone ask. Everything was on time and I was able to stretch out and enjoy some rest."
Jan 2020,40,"If you fly United, you know the WiFi did not work.","Okay, so the WiFi almost never works on United....the crew on our flight was great. They were efficient, business like but friendly and direct. I appreciated their maturity. Food was marginal, but okay for United. It hasn’t been good for a while. The crew made this one of the better flights we have been on recently. Please keep your crews with experience and age, United and hire more."
Jan 2020,10,Flight Change,"Very disappointed with United flight change policy. We booked flights to our sons college graduation, 5 months early. Unfortunately the date had to be changed 1 week later. We called United 3 days after booking, and were told the change fees were more than the cost of the 2 round trip tickets. I do understand,and will purchase new rockets for the following week. Today 1 week later, I get an email that United has changed the flight itineraries. They can make all the changes they need, but the consumer may not. Very disappointed, our trip is 5 months away and is the same fight schedule every week and they will not allow us to make a simple date change. That is, unless I pay $460.00 fees on 408.00 tickets. We will waste the current tickets and buy new, just because we need to see our son Graduate. Thanks for no help United."
Jan 2020,10,Worst customer care and airport staff,"I was at the airport the security personal pushed me and showed me in the line. asked me to clear the area when i politely asked why she started screaming and shouting on me. She must be having some digestion issues, must be having a bad day. I asked her to talk politely then she intimidated me and started calling AFP on me. AFP was smarted then her hence, they disregarded her call. Stupid and dumb staff and airline service. Not sure how the stewards will be in the flight. Not flying again with them."
Jan 2020,10,"Delayed, missed connections, break downs and not at all helpful desk agents","Our plane landed from SF into PPT 20 minutes after we where suppose to take off. There was major lack in communication for this delay. We were not too concerned at this point, until we landed in SF and sat on the tarmac for a period of time waiting.  I asked an attendant if she could help us make our connection to Calgary and she straight up said your probably wont make that.  I feel as though if made a priority to get us few people all connecting to calgary off this flight first, we would have made it just in time for our connection.  At the long line for what seemed to be all air united flights from all over the world who had missed their connections there was no sympathy just a man yelling at people, directing them to certain places. A half assed placed ""snack trolley"" to try help the sitiation.  Once we got to the desk unless we asked for compensation, like a meal voucher and or hotel or a shower she was not going to give us anything for our wasted time.  Now as we sit over 8 hours late to arriving home and our plane is delayed once again due to maintenance issues and we have a new plane coming into gate.  To add to this my dietary requests on both flights (tahiti and back) have not been met and I've had to miss out on both meals on the plane.  Super disappointed in air united."
Jan 2020,30,The flight was OK but the stewards were very grumpy.,"We paid a little extra for preferred seating but our seats did not seem any better than any of the others. We mentioned this to the crew and they said that was not their problem and sort it out with our travel agent. Perhaps they were the right seats and a civil answer would have been acceptable.    The stewards were sour faced and not very keen to help. They seemed like they would have preferred to be anywhere else and were constantly complaining about the airline. While we did not feel unsafe at all it made the flight unpleasant.    We did quite a few other flights in the USA and Canada and flew back in September with the same airline. We thought the service on our first flight may have been due to the crew being tired but discontent staff seemed to be more often than not. On our flight back the crew were being very rude about another passenger, name calling etc. Not very professional.    If not happy maybe look for another job, discuss with the airline but not around paying passengers."
Jan 2020,50,Very comfortable premium economy seating,"For years, a trip to Malaysia required making as many as four connections. So we were delighted when we found one which required only a single stopover for this international flight to the other side of the world. This was the Washington Dulles to Narita (NRT) flight via United Airlines (UA) and NRT to Kuala Lumpur via Malaysian Airlines. Funny thing, we did not feel inconvenienced by the 7-hour stopover at Narita Airport on the outbound flight but the 9-hour stopover on the return flight felt like eternity, even though we were in the United Lounge for 5 of those hours. There goes our newly found dream flight. We are, however, pleased that the premium economy seats of the United Airlines were very comfortable, the best we have experienced so far. And the flight attendants were friendly and kept us well fed. We were particularly impressed by the outstanding service of a staffer (didn’t get her name) who has been a UA flight attendant for 43 years. Hope our future flights on UA will mirror this flight."
Jan 2020,50,Delay,"Battery issue couldn't take off and no battery in Sioux Falls, flight delay 12 hours but they made it right with voucher and first class recovery"
Jan 2020,40,Basic economy a money pit,"Made a flight on their latest ticketing, basic economy (not economy). Worst choice ever. You can not bring a carry on (only bag under seat). You can not print out boarding pass at home. BUT, if you pay for carry on ($25) and promise you will check it, you can print boarding pass. Still, you can not bring carry on on plane, must check it unless you pay an extra $25 to bring it to the gate. You also can not select seats. You will get your seat at boarding. Oh yes, you can pay extra to reserve a seat ahead of time. don't do this, it's a huge hassle and can cost you more in the end. However, the pilots were very good, did great landings (and I know a good landing as I am a pilot). United Express redeemed itself only because of the pilots."
Jan 2020,20,Poor planning created unnecessary delays,"flew from Chile to Houston, TX on United without a hitch. had to change planes in Houston and was delayed for more than 2-1/2 hours. we were scheduled to arrive in LA by noon but finally got in around 2:30 pm.  (1) the incoming plane was late into Houston and United had to change boarding gate. we were notified by text message of departure gate when we first arrived, but no other texts were received about gate change although there were communications regarding delays. we had to checked the flights displays for updated gate info.  (2) we finally boarded and was waiting to push off, when pilot announced a fuel pump malfunction that had to be checked out for 10-15 minutes. pilot's 2nd announcement was that it was okay to fly with one fuel pump and it would take another 15-20 minutes to do the paperwork for this problem.  (3) we left the terminal and while we were proceeding to the runway, pilot announced that we have to return to the terminal to take on more fuel since there is not enough fuel in the tanks with the operational fuel pump. we returned to the terminal and waited some more while we were fueled up.    although United felt that operating one fuel pump would not jeopardize operations, they should have realized that they could not access all the fuel with the one pump and instead of pushing off and then returning to the terminal to add fuel, an United supervisor/engineer should have signaled this issue and advised the pilot to add fuel before leaving the terminal.    this poor planning lost a lot of time and many passengers missed their connecting flight in LA. we were lucky that it was our final destination and our ride was aware of the delays so he didn't have to drive around LAX for 2-1/2 hours.    (2) we were served complimentary drinks and snacks, but nothing extra for the excessive delays. notwithstanding, after drink service at beginning of flight, the attendants did not come around to collect the empty glasses, etc. we sat at the rear of the aircraft and could hear the attendants chatting but no one walked around to collect trash until time to land, consequently, forcing us to leave our tray tables down in an already cramped condition.    (3) I am petite and felt the economy seats were excessively narrow and uncomfortable.    having flown 4 different airlines in the last 6 months (primarily business class), United just edged out British Airways of providing the worst experience and worst value for business class. my business class ranking is Air Canada, American Airlines, United Airlines and then in last place, British Airways. United definitely rated poorly in our opinion also for economy class."
Jan 2020,10,Worst customer service and total SCAM!,"I pied an extra $100 to have a transferable ticket then sure enough i have to change my flight, so then they want an EXTRA $200 for a change of flight!!!!!! and all this after an hour on hold!!!"
Jan 2020,50,My flight was delayed but United airlines were very efficient at getting me on another flight.,"I had booked a flight from CDMX to Boston with a transfer in Newark, but as my first flight was delayed by over 3 hours I would have missed my connection. United were quick to rectify the situation and put me on a flight to Houston and then Boston. Was a bit stressful initially but grateful to United for their assistance and getting me to Boston that day. The planes may be a bit old but the customer service is excellent."
Jan 2020,10,Late & disorganized,"Our outgoing plane was delayed long enough that it became obvious we wouldn't make our connection. Customer service at the airport said, 'wait and see but you'll probably spend the night in Texas '. We asked a rep on the phone about other flight & partner airlines. We were told that United provides meal vouchers and hotel rooms and they would not look into partner airlines."
Jan 2020,40,Okay Flight - Charge for almost everything,"The flight was good; the staff was very good; the snacks are barely there; but we paid extra. We chose to pay extra to for priority boarding but not for First Class or better seats. We sat in the back on the flight there and on the flight back home. I will say this , we hit head winds and got there an hour early, which was great, but remember they all pad their times so they are not late!"
Jan 2020,50,Wonderful flight,All staff was super friendly. Bags were a little damaged but overall a great experience. The United app is way better than the other airline apps it’s very informational and easy to use.
Jan 2020,10,8 hours delay,We were taking a united airlines flight from NC to Canada with transit in IAD. The early morning flight from NC were delayed for 3 hrs due to an issue in their de-icing truck. They had to borrow Delta airlines truck ( I guess Delta has a better and newer equipment) causing us miss our connection. We arrived at our final destination 8 hours late.  The worst part is that the airlines don't even want to honor their own Notice of Rights for Canadian travelers and pay us the penalty specified for Canadian passengers.  Very bad customer service. This airlines are not recommended at all.
Jan 2020,50,Excellent leg room,"Seat pitch is fabulous, nice lot of leg room. Best one out of the American carriers. If you do alot of internal flights, best to stay with the same airline. Food always good."
Jan 2020,20,Fly with any other airline,"I have been lucky enough to fly on many different airlines and classes in my time, This time was less than acceptable.  Never met a more grumpy, dis-interested bunch of people representing United Airlines.  The crew were snappy and did not want to be there, it was like the passengers trying to please them not the other way around.The crew looked like like they were tired and worn out.  We paid for extra legroom which was terrific and for a 15 hour flight totally worth it.  The aircraft was a relatively new 787 Dreamliner which was excellent .  In flight entertainment was average at best, so glad I had the i-pad.  Food was terrible. Portions tiny presentation terrible even for economy class.  We regretted not eating beforehand and were hungry at our destination.  Had we known we would have bought snacks.  Meal services rushed and I was rudely told off for not asking for milk and sugar with my tea.  When my wife asked for a Sprite the crew member rudely said ""I'm not offering Sprite now"".    My advise is fly with United if you have too otherwise there are plenty of better airlines."
Jan 2020,10,Flight attendant courtesy,"What is happening? Cultural decline I’m guessing. Unbelievable how unfriendly this airline is. It seems passengers trying to please flight attendants rather than the reverse. Grumpy Gloria for example. Gloria refuses to hang my blazer because I missed sitting in first class by 10 minutes and one row. Gloria said she needed to make sure she had enough room for her first class. (I was happy to hang my own blazer, by the way) Moments later Gloria proceeded to hang the giant parka of a United employee was just riding along sitting much further back. Classic customer service :-) lol still there remained plenty of room and hangers, but she never once asked. Hey United; attitude reflects leadership, Captain"
Jan 2020,10,Rude gate person,Been diverted twice and traveled more than 16 hours only to be abused from this person at the gate. This is the last United trip I take
Jan 2020,40,Good flight to New Orleans,Flight to New Orleans was on time and had very good service. Stewardess even wished me a Happy Birthday! Return flight was delayed due to high winds at Newark Airport. Lots of turbulence on return flight but the pilot handled it well and landed safely. There was no in flight entertainment.
Jan 2020,40,Nice Flight,Overall I enjoyed this flight. We flew Business class to Sydney and thought the trip was overpriced for the comfort and service. On this trip we flew Premium Economy and I can honestly say I liked that class better for the price. The seat didn't recline into a bed but it did recline enough to get a fairly comfortable rest. The seat had plenty of room and the food was descent. The only down side was the service was not what I expected. Our Flight Attendant looked and acted like she was working on her day off. I didn't see her smile one time in 13 hours.
Jan 2020,30,Family and Fun,"My first reservations I had great direct flights from Norfolk to Houston and to return. Within a matter of weeks those flights were canceled. The new flights were several hours different and takeoff and landing and they each had a stop. It was very disappointing since I had to readjust part of my trip to visit my elderly aunt at her home.  When the airline causes a difference in your flights you have a chance to make changes to your flight without penalty which I did. In doing so I called United and the agent unfortunately was looking at the wrong month and gave me bogus information. Luckily I thought it was wrong and and questioned the information. Right before I did leave on my trip I found out there was a direct flight what’s the airline had not thought I needed to know about. United was very disappointing In that respect. I had booked my flight several months in advance using points so that I wouldn’t have to money. When I was trying to rearrange my flights after United had changed mine I kept hearing we don’t have first class service on that flight’ if you take that flight, it was always “we don’t have that class of service“. Be warned.  I rarely use United.  My last flight was a connection change via Dulles -because of weather. I  Was contacted via an email at 10pm the night before my 8 AM flight the next day. I don’t know how I was supposed to see it but I happened to see it when we had a disturbance with our power at the house...so at tm 2 a.m. or so I change flights and I couldn’t get the direct flight because they didn’t have my class of service and I went through Dulles and it was a nice flight with sleeper seats.  Tip: You can book early for a less expensive ticket but you won’t get the ticket you book."
Jan 2020,50,"Good service, meal and in-flight entertainment options","Good choice of two meal options on this international flight, one more Western and one more Asian. Coffee and water are always available. The in-flight entertainment system offered many movies and TV programs to choose from. The flight attendants provided friendly service."
Jan 2020,10,United delayed again,"We are regular United fliers, a delay of an hour is ok but 8! No! The flight came in the day before, was struck by lightning on that flight, United had a day to check and make adjustments on the flight but waited until an hour before to notify passengers, it was on United, we rebooked on our own four hours late, United did nothing to accommodate us, very disappointed!!!"
Jan 2020,40,"Long ""Cattle Car"" Flight","On a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, totally full. But the crew handled things well. Checkin was long with extra security in Brussels Airport. Meal was fine. Entertainment excellent. But seat cushions have lost their umpfh."
Jan 2020,50,United Flight,Great flight! Helpful and polite employees. Would definitely use United again. Seats were comfortable.
Jan 2020,10,Worst service,"I bought a ticket from them and was supposed to return singapore-tokyo-mexico city and later on my trip decided to rebook it and just take tokyo mexico city. They told me that I had to pay 130 USD which I did and that the change was confirmed. I got an email that confirmed another flight (sfo hong kong), I called to confirm if indeed I had the tokyo-mexico city and they told me to disregard the emails and that the change was confirmed.    15 days later, I'm trying to checkin in Tokyo and it wont let me. I went to the counter and they never changed it, they never even told me that they didn't change it and when I called the supervisor was a complete dick. He said: the only thing I can tell you is what i can do, and that is to change the ticket right now for 2,500 USD and you can get on the plane. Otherwise I had to buy a new ticket (5,000 USD).    Thankfuly I got a better service from ANA (they alwas have the best service, together with Cathay Pacific) and I managed to get a flight for less than 2,500 USD. At least they have a empathy (even though I wasn't their customer)."
Jan 2020,50,Pleasant Surprise,"Had a bit of an issue using the mobile app to check in only to be prompted to report to desk at airport as they could not process my details. I had a return journey booked for my return leg home from Cancun to Heathrow London with United Airlines the first part was originally Cancun to Chicago economy class and the connecting flight Premium economy.  I received an email on the morning of our departure stating there had been changes to my itinerary the flight times etc... had changed which was a plus I just had to change at Newark New York which was not an issue, my concern was I was unable to check in until I reached the airport. Upon arriving at Cancun airport the United Airlines staff were brilliant and very helpful and friendly they gave us a free upgrade to premium economy seats which was great, unfortunately they could not give us our seats for our connecting flight to London until we got to New York we had a 2hr stopover so we had plenty of time to get sorted the other side.  Once we landed at New York we went to check in our bags again and get our seat allocation, the staff once again pleasant and friendly they explained that they could not give us the premium economy seats we had booked but they would give us a free upgrade to Business Class, well we could not believe our luck and what a lovely surprise completely out of the blue we did not expect anything like that. The pods were comfortable, the in-flight entertainment was great and the Cabin Crew & Service brilliant they could not do enough for you... Well done United Airlines it made the overnight flight go so quick and feeling refreshed on arrival."
Jan 2020,50,Excellent Outbound flight back to Denver,"I couldn't get a late check out from my hotel SO I went back to the airport a little early. It turned out that there was a FIRST class seat on a MUCH earlier flight WITHOUT a fare surcharge SO I took advantage of it. TSA Pre-Check and CLEAR made the wait in the screening line go quickly. I had a light lunch at the lounge before boarding. The boarding at the gate went fast in Group 1. The seat was comfy and relaxing with adequate legroom as well as recline. First class beverages were fine as always. I got TWO snacks as some passengers weren't hungry. The flight was relatively smooth without incidents. Even though it's a short flight, somethings OTHER than chips, pretzels and fresh fruit SHOULD be offered in first class. United STILL has to work on cleaning the plane between flight. Otherwise it was a pleasant return trip."
Jan 2020,50,Excwllwnt Inbound flight to Vegas,I had an early morning flight to Las Vegas. Check In was EZ because it was Premier Access and I did everything electronically the day prior. I had TSA Pre-Check SO the screening line was QUICK. I stopped in the lounge and I got breakfast. Boarding was quick and painless. I got a drink as soon as I sat down. The flight was smooth and I was there before I knew it. I had my coffee with me from the lounge SO the scone I got on board went well with it. I KNOW it's a short flight BUT something MORE should be offered in 1st class for breakfast. It COULD have been a BIT Cleaner though. My seat was comfortable. NOT much to complain about at ALL!
Jan 2020,50,Outstanding - definitely recommend over delta sky one,"Due to rain inLA we missed our Delta connecting flight to Tokyo (Delta were not helpful at all even though we had 30 mins to get to the international terminal) - we spoke to numerous people and finally at delta check in we found another flight using United the following day. Normally don’t like United but Polaris going to Tokyo was excellent - two seats together, lots of room, seats very comfortable and exceptional staff. Will definitely use Polaris again - thank you to all the flight attendants who served us- very helpful and attentive."
Jan 2020,30,Hit a thunderstorm - bumpy flight,"Bumpy flight as we passed several storms. No food service because of the weather.  Was expecting more, not sure if it wouldn't be provided anyway or because of the weather"
Jan 2020,50,A wonderful flight made perfect by a great flight attendant! Samantha Mungle,"I don’t always fly United airlines because service can be inconsistent. However, big kudos to United airlines for my recent flight on United flight 4729 Chicago to Springfield, Missouri on 13 Jan 2020! The plane was clean. The pilots made an excellent, smooth landing.    And, most notably, Flight Attendant “Sammie” (Samantha Mungle) was pleasant, helpful, flexible, humorous and professional! In short, she cheerfully, competently, and repeatedly gave great service throughout this late evening flight!    I love the changes United Airlines seems to be making!"
Jan 2020,20,DFW-SFO,No gluten free snacks offered. There are so many people now who suffer from gluten sensitivities or allergies. Is it fair to hand out snacks to everyone but offer us nothing? How about a discount ? Or get with the program. There are so many restrictions on what can be carried onto the plane. Who has room to bring their own snacks?
Jan 2020,20,Do all the US airlines give poor service?,Back in the summer of 2019 we had the occasion to fly with United again but that was disappointing.  We were returning to Albuquerque with a stop in Denver. We were notified that there would not be a flight once we arrived in Denver because of a huge storm that was occuring. No more flights that afternoon. So...we slept at the airport and left early the next day.Is that acceptable?No not really.
Jan 2020,50,United - First Class Nassau to Newark - Quality Flight,"This is a relatively short trip - scheduled for 3 hours, just under 2 1/2 in the air.    The service was called business class as its an international flight but it is the same as domestic first class    The 737 was on time and properly cleaned and serviced when we boarded. Interesting the inbound came in quite full, the outbound was full up front (16) and less than 30 people in coach.    The pre departure beverage was offered as a choice (so I was able to get a diet coke instead of ""water or OJ""). The full bar was available.    The lunch service started promptly after take off and was a very good airline meal (bbq ribs and mashed sweet potatoes). There was also a salad option. Our drinks were kept full without asking including the two people still celebrating their vacation! After some turbulence the flight ended with fresh baked (or heated) chocolate cookies.    It was all you can ask for, good service, friendly service, and good (abit airline) food"
Jan 2020,50,UA Business Class Is Well Worth the Extra Cost,"A UA Business Class (BC) ticket from Newark to the DR entitles the ticket holder to access to the UA lounge. Not the greatest lounge but definitely an upgrade over having to battle for a seat at the gate. Once on the plane BC seats were comfortable. UA food in BC? Well it was tolerable, and served promptly (had breakfast on the way to DR and dinner from DR to Newark). Overall, I was very happy with the BC ticket to and from DR."
Jan 2020,10,Flight Delayed fron Last Night and Luggage Delayed,"They NEVER sent my husband a voucher they promised for a delayed luggage. Liars!!!! I called them three times regarding the voucher and they always responded: he will get the voucher in the mail.  Besides it, the flights messed up since coming from Havana and our mileage was never posted on our accounts. So disappointed with United."
Jan 2020,10,Fly the Friendly Skies?,Be very aware of check-in counter closure times. We had a flight scheduled from Shanghai to San Francisco.  We arrived at the at the check-in counter 55 minutes prior to departure - we arrived late due to going to the  a different airport at first. The UA personnel at the counter informed us that check-in closes 1 hour prior to  departure - were were there 55 miutes prior to departure. She would not check us in nor would she offer any assistance to get us out of our predicament and we missed our flight. We couldn't book another flight for the next day as it was full.  We had to cut our trip short by a few and fly back home directly at a huge cost. Clearing security and immigration departing the next day took about 20 minutes so that would have left us with enough time to board.
Jan 2020,10,Could They Be More Rude and Disrespectful,"I asked for help checking in my bags and a United kiosk worker yelled at me like it was her job. “IS THIS YOUR BAG!?” she yelled. I just stared at her and was thinking why is she yelling? When she then yelled the same thing even louder. I get maybe she was having a bad day but don’t take it out on me. Being nice and kind to people is free, don’t be rude. So unprofessional. Obviously they don’t care about how their staff treat there customers. No one likes being yelled at, especially when it wasn’t deserved. Put me in such a bad mood to the point where I won’t be flying them again."
Jan 2020,30,"5.5 hr flight, with no movies, first class, and they broke my bag",Not a bad seat. Comfy but required a seat extender. Older aircraft. Attendants were nice but indifferent and considering a 5.5 hr flight without any entertainment at all I thought they should have been in front of us much much more. The food was acceptable but not recommendable. Vacation transportation should be joyous. This was a cold hard business flight.
Jan 2020,40,Good Flight Attendant Service and Pilot Communications,"I had two legs on this trip that took me thru San Francisco. Both flights had wonderful flight attendants- Karen and Heidi. They made the flight fun and enjoyable. Checking on our needs, making some funny jokes on the loudspeaker. Very personable. The pilots gave us information on what was outside the window and for the leg from SF to Seattle that we were delayed by air traffic control due to weather in Seattle. We made up most of the time. Very enjoyable flights."
Jan 2020,50,Flew Basic Economy,"Sometimes I wonder how those birds stay together up there the way we get bounced around, nothing against our pilots, I know they were trying to find the less turbulent route. I was surprised with the leg room, I usually have my knees into the seat in front, but had plenty of leg room. We landed, safely, about 18 minutes ahead of schedule which was bonus. Altogether not a bad flight"
Jan 2020,40,Not that bad,"United is not my first choice of airlines but these flight came as part of an overseas travel package. Two legs, Salt Lake to Chicago the Chicago to Amsterdam. Upgraded to premium economy for the flight to Amsterdam and was pleased with the accommodations. Adequate leg room to stretch on a long flight. Did take my own seat cushion, airplane seats are what they are. No problems with check in, onboard service or baggage plus both flights were on time"
Jan 2020,50,"Thank you guys
The best",The best comfort with your experience the priority    Great seat comfort & perfect leg room ( I’m a larger size man) great food    Will fly with you again  Internal flights were also a pleasure with luggage confidentiality transferred from plane to plane    Flying United on our next trip for certain. Thanks again guys
Jan 2020,10,No flight status updates or reimbursement for additional expenses,"My wife and I recently flew with United Airlines. We were returning to Portland from Charleston. We were never notified that our flight was CANCELED out of CHS. According to the representative I talked to on the phone, the flight had been canceled for weeks and were never notified.    Because of this, we had to reschedule a flight for the next day. This cause us to incur additional expenses including a hotel room, extending the rental car, food, etc. United Airlines is refusing to reimburse us even though our expenses are 100% their fault.    We aren't asking for a flight refund, just the additional cost that was caused because of their failure to communicate. We won't be flying with them again."
Jan 2020,40,2 long haul flights and numerous internal flights USA,"Apprehensive about flying United but they were the cheapest flights around Christmas and all our flights were on time and our luggage arrived at its destinations.  Our first long haul Sydney to LA was very good. The food was really nice and the air stewards were friendly and accommodating. But, on the way home it was a different story as the food was horrible and the stewards were cranky.  Internal flights there isn’t any inflight entertainment but you can download and you can get a soft drink and pretzels included in the flight.  What I did like is that United kept me constantly updated with flight information and gates and baggage carousel numbers via email. They even gave directions to connecting gates which is very handy in unfamiliar airports."
Jan 2020,40,We Boarded on Time & Left on Time!,"I was very surprised that our departure went so smoothly since the weather conditions weren't the best. United Express had us leaving from Terminal A which was very nice. The on flight crew was pleasant. Once we arrived in Savannah, it was easy to get our luggage and car rental."
Jan 2020,50,Pleasantly surprised,"Firstly I do not like sitting towards the back of the plane but best seats in Economy were row 28. Imagine my surprise when a few days before my flight I received an email from United Airlines offering me complimentary upgrade to Economy Plus.could hardly believe it but I followed the instructions and got two seats on Row 8. Everything about the flight from checking to more comfortable seats, to leaving on time. To polite attendants. Smooth flight and landing on time safely was perfect."
Jan 2020,30,Terrible service for gold members,"The wife and I booked flights from San Francisco to Newark with adjoining seating. When we checked in on the day before our flight, we found the airline changed our seats to be 10 rows apart. We are both gold members so we did not expect to be treated this way. When I called the elite phone number, they told us there was nothing they can do as it was a full flight. That wasn’t the case since there were empty seats shown on the flight status and there were empty seats on the plane. In fact, the person who sat in the seat next to me flew standby so the seat was open during boarding. If I had a choice for another airline, I’d probably take it."
Jan 2020,40,Denver to SFO,"Our original flight was cancelled, but we were rebooked to a flight that left 2 minutes later! Didn't get to choose seats, but it was a nice, half-empty flight :)"
Jan 2020,40,Fort Lauderdale to Dallas to San Luis Obispo,"Now granted I took a very early 530AM flight to Dallas on my way to California for the Holidays. I usually fly First/Business Class to the West Coast and took an Airbus A720 which was fine, entertainment worked and the breakfast was actually very good. Take off and landing was on time. Note to never fly on Sunday morning to Dallas, as there is no alcohol service in the club rooms until 11:00AM! Connecting flight was great to SLO in a new CRJ 700. The 700 is a great lane with full service and First Class seating."
Jan 2020,20,We avoid United whenever possible,"We are not tied to any one airline, fly allegiant a lot, fly Delta, American to the caribbean. Price is first, ease is second everything else third. Except we will now avoid United whenever possible.    First, they changed our flight that connected intentionally in San Francisco to Chicago. We had all our family meeting there and flying in to Honolulu together. No e-mail was sent, we all found out 24 hours before when we went to check in and saw we all had different flights. Our two 5 hour flights became a 1 hour and 9 hour flight. Not ideal with two small children. We also were separated from my 80 year old mother. All with no notice.    Then, we received a text at 3:30 in the morning telling us that our connecting flight to Chicago was canceled due to staff having too many air hours. Thankfully my wife was awake and managed to book a different flight out of Dayton (about the same distance) to Chicago. If we had gotten up at our planned time, we would have missed our flights altogether.    The flight itself was fine. Staff, except for one very nice steward, seemed to really dislike their jobs. They were not friendly or helpful at any point. Despite 9 hour flight(10 hour back because they switched us to D.C.), no food was provided. We got the little cookies in the first hour and nothing else. You could pay a ton for some crappy sandwich, but no meal provided. Flight to Europe is shorter and they provide food and drinks.    My poor mother had a worse experience, though similar, except she missed a whole day in Hawaii because of United messing with flight times. We have all vowed to avoid United at any cost."
Jan 2020,10,Ridiculous.,"United canceled our return flight because we couldn’t make the first flight because we had to take our baby to the emergency room. They’ve always been consistently pretty terrible, so to be honest I’m not surprised by this."
Jan 2020,10,Ridiculous,"To start off this wonderful review, my flight for returning got cancelled. I contacted three different agents in total. First agent had huge attitude and tries to ""claim"" that I exchanged my ticket flight for another one. I explain to her that it didn't happen and that even ""if"" I did, wouldn't I be receiving an email to confirm the ""exchange"" or notify me about it. I check my email every day or two and I can most likely guarantee that I did not receive any email of sort. She then tells me that she can book me a flight back, but I would have to pay extra for the ticket. My mind went????? Is she really telling me to pay extra, when I'm the innocent customer that got his flight cancelled and that I have to contribute a little more out of my pocket for a ticket that I originally paid for? Then she puts me on hold for a good twenty min and then she ends the call. So I call back and another agent picks up the phone. I explained what happen and the agent claims that the first agent was new to this and apologize for it. So we try to figure out another flight for me and we have one at 6:20 am. I was like yea sure give me that one. For over an hour phone call, she puts me on hold and then she transfer me to her supervisor which never answered and so I had to redial the customer service line the third time. Onto the third agent, finally I got an confirmation for the flight, but a few things United airline could have done was to at least accommodate for their mistake, no email notification for my flight that was supposedly cancelled or exchanged. I'm deeply unsatisfied to what had happen here. #lack of communication #lack of trained agents # lack of service"
Jan 2020,10,Worst airline!!!,"Absolutely the worst airline I've ever used. Will never in my life fly United again. Was separate from my daughters on a flight. After seeing 5 empty seats near them, I asked the flight attendant if I could move up to be near them, the flight attendant proceeded to tell me that I couldnt sit there because they were ""upgraded seats"" .... so after we were in the air and the seats were still empty, I asked the other flight attendant if I could move up near my daughters, I was told no. Those seats sat empty the entire flight, but I couldnt use one directly behind my young daughters because they were ""upgraded seats"" ... unbelievable. Our return flight was just as bad, horrible customer service, employees with bad attitudes, I've never in my life flown such a horrible airline before."
Jan 2020,20,Lack of Commitment,"We flew to and from Bonaire on United. It felt like they have very little commitment to this route. It was ~ 2 hours late departing for BON, and 8 hours late leaving BON for home. Both times the messages blamed staffing for the delays.    The flight is just shy of 5 hours long, so they did have the in flight movies available while over the oceans. The staff seemed tired and only 1 or 2 were kind.    It’s a very small airport with stair exits. Things are happen slowly there.    The ground staff for did not seem knowledgeable. The ticket counter staff (where bags are checked) was awesome! Breath of fresh air!!    Originally we were grateful to discover United was a direct option, but without additional commitment to maintaining their service level commitments, there are two other very good choices."
Jan 2020,40,Direct flight from NY to Havana,"I took Dec.17 flight from NY to Havana,  There were 5 hours delayed in Newark airport. And 2 hours waited at baggage claim in Havana airport.  It’s good to have 3hours non-stop flights from NY to Havana but need to plus delay hours..."
Jan 2020,40,Friendly staff in spite of weather related flight delays affecting both legs of the journey,"Didn't mean to give negative title since we had a decent flight overall. I'd like to say that even after I mentioned that we have a connecting flight and requested the flight attendant to announce to let us out first because we have to clear the immigration lines in Newark airport and have to check back the baggage in all within the time span of 1.5 hours (first leg started late by 30 mins) and verbally getting the attendants confirmation about what I had asked, nothing was done to accommodate us. Our situation quickly became stressful. I really hope that flight attendants take this aspect seriously for the ease and comfort of passengers traveling on their flights.  We all had TSA-Pre clearance still couldn't avail because the counter closes at 8:45 pm at Newark airport. So, we could've used every bit of help. Only reason we were able to catch the next flight was because it got delayed by an hour."
Jan 2020,50,Great company great service,Flew United from Frankfurt to Denver I had a great experience. The food was good and flight attendants courteous and helpful.
Jan 2020,40,Holiday air transport,"We were scheduled to travel economy class by our agents from London to Las Vegas as the first part of our holidays. We subsequently travelled on to Los Angeles and directly back to Heathrow, all by United.  The seats were reasonably comfortable with a fair amount of legroom, although I did not find the headrest as good as on some other airlines.  The attendants were ok, but I was not highly impressed by the food on board.  All planes were full which meant onboard luggage was difficult to stow for some especially as they appeared to overlook oversized hand baggage.  The planes in each case arrived in a timely manner and the flights themselves were satisfactory"
Jan 2020,50,Trip to Cancun,Flew United from Austin to Cancun for a 6 day holiday. Great trip both ways with friendly staff. Returning flight from Cancun to Houston was delayed but our captain was able to make up time and got us to Houston in time for our connection to Austin. Thanks captain!
Jan 2020,40,Flight to Portland Maine,"Flight was on time and comfortable. A regional partner for United, plane was smaller jet but seats were comfortable and had plenty of leg room, even for someone over 6'."
Jan 2020,40,very handy,"new aircraft seems to be easier to board than British domestic flights, staff good and comfortable seats"
Jan 2020,50,Smooth Travel,Placed all tickets on line via United Web Page. All flights on time and easy travel to and from Denver
Jan 2020,40,New Premium Plus,"I'm a regular United traveler, but this was the first trip on a plane refitted with the new Premium Plus cabin. The seat was significantly better than the previous Economy Plus. More room all round and only 2-2-2 configuration. Great TV and entertainment. Above seat bin was ample (unless your one of those tossers who takes about three bags and two coats on board as carry on baggage) and good storage around the seat.Good recline and leg rest (if your legs aren't too long). Beverage and food was way better than previously, even it it did boil down to pasta or chicken with fancy names. My only complaint was the scrambled eggs and bacon I chose for breakfast just prior to landing at Heathrow. Just awful, a disaster! Hope it was a one off as this really spoil the whole experience. Overall is is a great improvement much more in line with the Premium Plus offered by Singapore Airlines for example. I will certainly be taking the Premium Plus again."
Jan 2020,40,Pretty good,"On time and pretty good service. Even though it was the crazy holiday travel season everyone seemed to be very grateful for our business. I thanked them all for working Christmas day and was met with ""Our Pleasure."
Jan 2020,40,Great flight,"Great flight, great service and right on time. The food was good for airline meals. And getting on and off the plane was well organized."
Jan 2020,40,Flight home from Washington DC,Tried premium economy since price was lower since this is a new line Tel Aviv/DC. I would never spend regular price because difference between economy & premium is minimal in my opinion. Better getting economy then pay for bulkhead or exit.
Jan 2020,30,Flight home,Small regional jet so light on comfort. On these short hauls make sure good to bathroom before boarding because bathroom on plane very cramped & uncomfortable
Jan 2020,20,Not what it used to be; status means nothing; amenities in lounges and in flight are poor,"Too many negative experiences to count over the course of several flights.  *In-flight food is never great; it's either tolerable or terrible.  *50/50 chance you'll have a screen to watch shows, otherwise you have to use your phone which is annoying to hold up to see or set on your tray table and strain your neck looking down.  *Pop up lounge in EWR was a joke; bad service, bare bones amenities, cheap. *Status requirements constantly are changing, making it so that you jump through hoop after hoop and still don't achieve elevated status because the goal posts keep changing.  *Was on a cancelled flight and got rebooked on Delta only to get to the gate and be denied boarding because United didn't properly rebook, which meant I had to start over in line and wait for 3 hours...waited 30 minutes at Premier Access check in because there were only 2 overwhelmed agents helping 40 people and stressfully almost missed my flight...aircraft changes have resulted in being bumped and downgraded on seating (multiple flights)...exit row seating is literally painfully uncomfortable and all seats are horribly designed both in coach and first class with the exception being for flat beds and Premium Economy Plus on international flights; never offered pillows on domestic red-eye flights...delays, delays, delays...this was all in 2019."
Jan 2020,10,Hell on Wings--Avoid at All Costs,"My flight from Washington to London was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the most dehumanizing experience I have ever had for any transportation whatsoever. When boarding the plane, my overhead compartment was filled with cardboard, other trash, and a few odd plastic bags. The male flight attendant told me to just place it behind my seat. So I did. Thirty minutes into the flight, another flight attendant, who I know watched me remove the trash from the overhead bin, started screaming at me in front of all my friends; that junk was hers, and she wanted to know why it was behind my seat. However, when I tried to explain the situation, she forcibly removed my bag, carried it off to somewhere that I didn't know, and put her trash back where it was.    From that point on, I was never served a drink, towel, or snack by any of the flight attendants after that, although everyone around me did. They were rude and disrespectful to me (more than they were to everyone else) throughout the rest of the flight.    When dinner was served, the male flight attendant, mind you the one who caused this trouble in the first place, slopped a plastic bin of some unannounced pasta sludge in front of me with the snide comment ""and this little boy (I'm a grown man) will be receiving his liver and onions for dinner this evening"" loudly in front of my whole professional cohort. This was very embarrassing. By the taste of dinner, though, I think I would have rather had the liver.    By the time we touched down in London, I was so humiliated and frustrated that I just wanted to get off the plane. Unless United attempts to make things right, I won't be back."
Jan 2020,40,Friendly but do't ask for too much.,The price for the tickets are always high. There is very seldom any low rates. The check in and on board experience is what it is. a $800 ticket to get a 15gm cookie and a soda on a 5.5 hours flight. Not cool at all!
Jan 2020,50,Polaris Lounge made the trip special,Polaris Lounge made the trip special. Otherwise just another long plane flight. Attentive service in flight and the lounges.
Jan 2020,30,Winter Getaway,Check-in is slow so make sure you’re at the airport with lots of time. Flight attendants are nice and friendly. Baggage claim is quick in San Diego but extremely slow in Calgary.
Jan 2020,30,Normal Experience,Overall not great service by United Airlines. Got delayed from Kona which is not a big deal. Stuff happens in the airline industry and it takes time to fix. Also a small airport so there were few options for the airline as far as righting the wrong. However the in-flight service was subpar on a flight where many people would have appreciated the crew’s best effort. The entirety of the company seems inefficient on many levels. Not saying there is anything wrong with United but there are better options out there.
Jan 2020,20,Leisure SLC to SFO trip.,"The flying experience is not what it used to be, but I digress.. The flight staff are friendly, but the plane was so dirty and not clean- I guess that is how travel is nowadays..But there was so much garbage in my area, around my seat-it was a little disturbing. Best of luck, all my fellow air travelers.."
Jan 2020,10,unprofessional,"The plane was crowded which to be expected yet the size of the plane was the issue. The flight crew was not friendly especially the middle aged Asian women serving the economy section. I had to hold my piece because who wants to have to deal with air marshals, It appeared as though she wanted me to say something so the situation would escalate, I just wanted to get home, Thank God I had downloaded the app on my phone since there was no in flight entertainment. In addition they wanted to charge 130 for 2 seats in the exit row."
Jan 2020,10,United gifted me a 10 hour layover at Wash DCA after cancelling my afternoon flight without any other offer,"Spent 10 hours at the Washington Reagan (taxied from Dulles US$70) after cancelling my original booking which had me on a 1600 flight back home; when I asked for a refund they referred me to ""Customer Feedback"" which and this is a quote ""sorry you were disappointed but we look forward to serving you in the future"" well dear United it is doubtful I will ever use your airline again as this is the second time it happens; you are incompetent and have no customer service to speak of"
Jan 2020,50,best air flight we had for the entire trip.,plane had plenty of space. large carry on compartments. crew was wonderful. plenty of movie choices. clean .
Jan 2020,30,Houston to Ft Lauderdale,"2-1/2 hour flight in economy seats. Bearable but just so. The seats are wide enough but not deep enough. Houston airport is brand-new and pretty awesome. Lots of places to sit and plug in your electronic device + free wifi. Ft. Lauderdale -- crowded, lack of decent seating and not very many good places to eat. The plane was full in both directions. The in-=flight entertainment was fairly lousy. One good movie -- Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Can't believe it was available considering that there weren't any other good movies to choose from."
Jan 2020,20,No flight was on time - no weather issues,"We made the mistake of NOT going non-stop. We went from Boston to Newark and changed planes for Miami. And did the reverse coming back. None of the four flights left on time. On one of the legs we were on the plane (late) and the plane was sent to the ""penalty box"" so there would be landing space in Newark. On another leg, we were onboard late and then spent another hour waiting for the security people (3 policemen) to remove a disruptive passenger. That wait was far too long; security should have been requested immediately. My advice - only fly non-stop when possible. Fortunately, the weather was fine; the flight attendants were pleasant; and every landing was smooth."
Jan 2020,50,Premium Plus is the business light,"Premium Plus was actually cheaper than economy at the time of booking so we decided to give it a try. It truly felt like a business class experience, except for the recline. The seats were wide and comfortable, leg room great, food OK+. Service was very good. On our way back we had a night flight, and we felt that the seat recline should have been a little bigger, but all in all it was a good experience."
Jan 2020,40,Competent and efficient Airline,"Flew Vancouver - Houston - Panama City.  Returned Panama City - Houston- Denver - Vancouver.  Certain legs flew business, others standard.  Especially on the outbound trip, cabin crew went above, and beyond.  Nothing really exceptional, however, as a ‘Fill the Seats’ airline, there a certainly a lot worse."
Jan 2020,50,Seamless flight,"Courteous flight attendants. Let passengers deplane before others if they have connecting flights. Short flight, easy to make reservations with an aisle seat"
Jan 2020,10,Less than bad !,"Worst experience ever 3gr delay in sac. Spent 14 in Chicago same day ,gate changed 6 times overhead speaker always sites maintenance issues. Will never fly again was that bad an as I spoke many others said the same thing. Attendants don't seem to care on the ground like they are used to it. Take southwest whenever you can"
Jan 2020,50,GREAT FLIGHTS & SERVICE - THEY SAVED ME,"After being stranded by Air Canada in Los Angeles on December 19, 2019, (they caused me to miss my connecting flight with United Airlines) a United Airlines Supervisor stepped up to the plate and helped me.    I was left in the L.A. airport to my own accord by AC for what was to be 23 hours. I was offered NO help by them. Not even a food voucher, or a hotel recommendation, etc., NOTHING.    But, after 4 hours of being shifted by AC staff and their Supervisor, the UA Supervisor (Hunter) provided me with a hotel voucher for the Sheraton, food vouchers, a travel voucher for $150 and booked upgraded seats on the remainder of my flights for that trip (including the return flights). He printed my boarding pass for the next morning flight, put a PRIORITY sticker on my checked bag and made sure I got safely to the hotel shuttle (I was travelling alone in an unfamiliar airport). He was amazing.....I can not thank you enough Hunter.    All staff were courteous and friendly. Everyone was provided with little blankets in plastic envelopes (for sanitary purposes) - not the best quality but they worked great for the purpose and it was more than the AC flight had to offer. The service was great and the flight attendance were helpful to all who needed their assistance.    I would highly recommend them."
Jan 2020,50,Great flight buts hem in Newark,Flew to New York over Christmas and delighted to fly with United. Staff were excellent and very attentive. Check in was brilliant in Dublin and very efficient however the experience in Newark was awful. Massive queues no helpful staff actually staff who would rather be somewhere else. Very bad customer service and down right rude. The direct opposite to Dublin. When finally checked in and through security everything else was on point. Flight back to Dublin was excellent as were staff.
Jan 2020,30,Better Than Expected,"My flights to DC from Shreveport, LA via Houston went very well, & the service was very good. The return flight had an approximate 2 hour delay, but considering it was on December 19, 2019, & what I would suspect were the high volume of passengers then, I don't find that to be a problem. I've had concerns with travel on United in the past, so I'm still recovering from that. Overall, however, I was very impressed & want to continue using them."
Jan 2020,40,Uneventful return flight between Houston IAH to Fort Lauderdale FLL,The flight took off and landed on time going both ways. On board service was good. Seats comfortable.
Jan 2020,50,Get away!,As always the flight was easy and enjoyable. We don't always fly first class but on this special occasion it was worth it.
Jan 2020,40,Flight to Cancun,"Flight was short and good, they had less overhead space so they checkedin our carryons too. My seat was little uncomfortable as I think it as very old plane on our way  back. But overall good as this is short flight."
Jan 2020,50,Excellent Flight &Service,"We flew via IAD and both flight crews were exceptional. Flight was smooth & quick, staff was friendly, professional & awesome. Can’t wait for the next one!!"
Jan 2020,40,Non-stop Flights Appear to Have More Leg Room,"Three to four times a year I travel East-West/West-East Coast: NYC Airports through SFO, LAX, PDX on my way to regional airports like SBP and EUG.    I don't pay for extras in general because these tickets are already $800+ so I deal with non-stop 5-6 hour flights, including red-eyes. The last few flights I've noticed that the LA-Newark non-stop planes have 3-4 inches more leg room in economy. Maybe I booked early enough or was given the right seats since I'm a single traveler? The seats reclined back too.    Entertainment and complimentary head sets were provided for each seat. Some flights require downloading the United App before the flight. Passengers streamed their own entertainment.    Flight staff was attentive, fairly nice. Gate staff too for that matter. I mostly travel holidays to visit family (Thanksgiving, Christmas, 4th of July) so that's been a new surprise.    The gate crowd: Invariably a few small dogs fly with their owners to/from Cali. I personally don't mind the doggies. United has in-airport facilities for pets. Perhaps this is why so many pet owners comparatively. As for the people, on a NY to LA flight recently, a rude-drunk combative woman was escorted off the plane swiftly. No tolerance for that. The flight was delayed 15 to deal with her fit. People.    Overall, is it my imagination or is there an effort to boost the coast-to-coast travel experience? Fingers crossed."
Jan 2020,30,Unfortunately there was cold air blowing on me throughout the flight. The staff was unable to adjust it.,"I fly United quite often. The service is generally very good. The staff on this flight was very good. However, there was no way to control the cold air that was blowing on where I was sitting. It was very uncomfortable."
Jan 2020,10,Luggage Lost,"I landed Sao Gon at 12:30 am Jan12, 2020 and waited until 3am for luggage lost. I was said I should go to the airport to pick up. Otherwise it would be delivered next a couple days because of traffic. I called many times to double check if my luggage had arrived but no response. I had to go to airport and learned that I should wait until next day. All my new clothes and gifts for family are in that luggage. I visited Vietnam for Tet Holidays but I had only one suit to wear! I don't know I should cry or laugh! So many passengers lost luggage in my trip. The officer there explained they might use another carrier to save expense. It caused luggages delayed. I had no idea if I could find my luggage. I will never flying with United Airlines again."
Jan 2020,30,Overall a good flight,"Except for the occasional crew not knowing what was happening, it was a good flight.    The United app showed us arriving and leaving from the same gate, which would be great as it was a 40 min transfer. But the crew was thinking that this flight went somewhere else. All in all it worked out and was a pleasant flight. The Untied club lounge was very nice for a 3 hour layover on one leg. Comfortable and great snacks. I would recommend the lounge for any extended layovers."
Jan 2020,30,Smooth uneventful flight .. best!,Flight left on time & arrived early by 20-25 mins. Flight was packed with limited overhead baggage cabin space Checkin and onboard service was good. Onboard WiFi did not work well.
Jan 2020,30,UA staff need better training!,"The flight from Beijing started out almost 2 hours late. The crew was late arriving to the airport. In spite of this, there was no apology from the crew. In fact, the Flight attendants in the business class were actually rude and not at all welcoming. I had to get their attention thrice before one of them took my coat. Throughout the flight, poor customer service was evident in every aspect. They just didn’t care. They were too caught up in themselves, to offer customers good service.    I think UA should send staff for customer service training to Singapore Airlines.    As a customer in the business class, I was thoroughly dissatisfied."
Jan 2020,50,Great Flight,"I scored a great flight fare on United over the holidays, from Las Vegas to Monroe. The fare included a carryon bag as well as advance seat selection. The flight connects thru Houston and of course is a larger aircraft as supposed to the smaller plane that you change to to get into Monroe, but I found both flights to be comfortable. I lucked out on the rerun flight from Houston, that plane was equipped with inflight live TV. The flight was smooth and the gate agents as well as the ground crew were courteous and professional. Definitely will fly again!"
Jan 2020,40,Suzi-Q's Airline Review,"It was a pleasant flight however I wish we could have flown nonstop or to a different airport. We did not have much time to get to our connecting flight going to Costa Rica. On the return flight from Costa Rica was a real joke. I have never been through such drama in my life, with checking in my luggage and dragging it through that huge airport."
Jan 2020,50,Christmas/Birthday Trip,All I can say it was a very pleasant experience with United. They were very accommodating. We did have a layover in Denver it was overnight so there was an issue with our bags we were required to take them with us because it was over 12 hours. So that meant we had to pay an additional $30 per bags meaning an additional $90.00 but the Rep in Vegas took care of that and so we didn’t have to. All and all everyone from United was amazing. Oh and we got to NY 30 mins early which was nice as well.
Jan 2020,10,Worst airline,I have no clue why is Lufthansa sharing codes with this pathetic so called airline. Went to Europe with United and came back with Lufthansa. A world of difference between them. Troubles from check in to landing. Why not sell the whole airline to Germans so they can make it work?
Jan 2020,20,Worst Airline experience ever!,"I did not think it was possible to cram more seats on a plane! The DC to Tel Aviv flight was approx. 11 hours. I'm not a huge person. The seats were tiny and I could not move. I couldn't stretch my legs at all. The aisles were less than 24 in. There was practically no padding on the seats. It was horrible.    I've had bad experiences with United before, this was the worst!"
Jan 2020,10,Do not fly United.. always delays or cancellations,Every experience I’ve had with United has been negative. They always have “maintenance problems” with the aircraft and will delay for hours until it is finally cancelled. You will miss connections and be stuck at the airport overnight without a hotel or any compensation like myself. Do yourself a favor and never book with them.
Jan 2020,40,MORE BUCKS FOR THE MONEY,Excellent Price for the holidays to see the family. No hassle and worry free reservations. I will definitely use them again for future travels.
Jan 2020,40,Smooth journey,Everything was smooth. Loading/unloading in both places went great. All the staff were pleasant and willing to help.
Jan 2020,10,More delays and lies than service,"Flight was on schedule all day, weather was impending, but was going to be worse towards Houston and they rerouted the plane there instead. And in an area with an average $200 rooms they give a $50 voucher. Instead of calling the flight after the first 2 hour delay they continued to delay it every half hour by a half hour. Until they finally cancelled the flight at 1:45am. They kept saying oh the flight is clear to take off and would arrive shortly. Will be the last time I choose United."
Jan 2020,50,I got upgraded - paid one - but sometimes even you pay you won't get upgraded so this one was great!,"Love United's new business first with flat bed, great space, and gadgets! Food is great. I got upgraded for out bound from SFO to NRT. I also had premium economy (or they call something else) for in bounds which also was amazing with so much space. Other airline had better rating a few year's ago but United beats JAL."
Jan 2020,10,"Dirty planes to and from Fargo, North Dakota","The United flights to and from Fargo, ND, are operated by United Express. Most of the time there are late, never cleaned, very dirty and the ground service in Fargo Hector Airport is substandard. Sadly, you do not have other options."
Jan 2020,10,What a disgusting treatment,"We had our eta in order, but linked through 2 passports. We explained what the Canadian immigration explained on a previous flight, that it is fine. United then, because their computer system can't register it, and 0 human brain power was used, caused us to be withheld.  Later, after a talk with a Canadian immigration they are wrong and we are right. But a loophole allows them to say it's our fault. No help, no hotel. Never ever using this unprofessional and lazy airline again. A more lazy and not caring employees you have to look far for"
Jan 2020,50,Return home was comfortable,Flying home was nice with united. It was fast and traveling with a. Hild it. An always be crazy but the flight was so nice and staff was helpful too. During the flight my daughter was able to sleep comfortably and play and the staff provided her with snacks.
Jan 2020,40,what are the flight attendants doing??,"It was “thoughtful” of the airline to provide an extra flight which is not usually scheduled in order to accommodate all those attending the CES this week...HOWEVER...it would be nice to pay attention to normal rules of travel:  -several people continued to text and use phones well into take-off  -the aisle passenger never stowed his carry on properly so it blocked my exit from the window seat during landing  -garbage was never collected😢  Otherwise, the flight was on time! Yay!"
Jan 2020,40,"Long Flight To Argentina, But Very Good","Our flight was very nice. First time since 1992 that we traveled out of the country this far. We were pleasantly surprised at the ease of getting through TSA. Our seats had the extended legroom and my tall hubby was not cramped at all. They served us a nice dinner, though it was about 10 pm, and then in the early AM the next day we had a small, but good breakfast. The attendances were nice and chatty and the flight was smooth as could be. On our return a week later, United upgraded us to Business Class, and we had even better seats. Our golden bonus!"
Jan 2020,40,United to the rescue,"We had booed flights on Allegiant to get to colorado and back home, however they were not able to land in Fort Collins due to the city messing stuff up, and I was surprised that United had the best flights and options for us. I actually ended up saving 100.00 per ticket using United. Sometimes it pays to book early other times holding out is better."
Jan 2020,40,United is improving.,"The planes for both directions were newer aircraft. Lots of entertainment options to help fill the hours. Be sure to download the United App before you board, if you want to watch on your mobile device. I didn't realize my wife's phone did not have the app until we were on the plane. Just barely got it downloaded before we pushed back from the gate.    Also, if you have not flown out of Singapore before, the security and boarding process is different. You go through a light check getting in to the departure area but then go through the regular security screening at the gate. Be sure to be at the gate an hour before your flight, to allow time for this. Don't bother to fill your water bottle or buy water because you cannot take it through. The crew gave us all bottles of water shortly after take off."
Jan 2020,40,UA 750 on 1/6/20,We had a good flight. It took off about 5 minutes late but we arrived on time at O'Hare. United had pushed back our flight schedule by 2 hours and gave us 14 days notice. Unfortunately this cost us about $150 in additional taxi fees in Chicago. The food we purchased at the United terminal in Miami was terrible.
Jan 2020,40,Flight UA 1407 on 1/2/20,We had an excellent flight. It was very full. It took off on time and arrived on time. The food we purchased at the United terminal at O'Hare was very mediocre
Jan 2020,40,Its the red eye but its doable here!,"My son and I took the red eye to PDX and this was a flight I had taken previously with my daughter so knew the ins and outs of possible scenarios! The flight was only about a little over half capacity so we ended up with our own seats, which made for a great nap on the way home! Service was fantastic and cordial."
Jan 2020,10,The flight attendant tried to bring what I did not order.....,"I was not sure to choose United since people say they discriminate women and asians. Unfortunately I felt what they said was right.    The male flight attendant was friendly but he somehow tried to keep bringing what I did not order and never brought what I ordered. I ordered coffee with milk but received coffee with cream instead. He also brought almond snacks which I did not order. I would like to know if that is the United way of welcoming customers or they are actually boycotting milk...or just doing what they want.    They just changed their CEO, so I would like to see any difference can happen in future."
Jan 2020,40,It seems United has upped their game!,Everything United did from start to finish was top notch. Service and food were excellent. On time both directions. A few years ago I would not have given this stellar rating to them but they earned it.
Jan 2020,30,"Nice while in transit, but not while sitting on the ground inside the plane","Traveled for our honeymoon, and changed flights in Newark, NJ to Rejkyavik, Iceland and had to wait 30 minutes to get out of the plane. Then switched planes and had to sit on it on the ground for 1 hr before we took off. Couldn't get up to use the bathroom until we got the okay up in the air. On the flight back upon landing in Newark, NJ we sat on the plane for 25 minutes before we could get a gate to get out of the plane. The in flight movie screen at my seat was broken, as was my fold out table. Rough for a 5+ hr flight. Not worth how much I spent on the tickets."
Jan 2020,30,Typical Flight In The Current Age,"Air travel these days appears to be something to endure, rather than enjoy. Our trip was as expected - full flights, insufficient seat room, too many people with big carry-on's due to onerous charges to check your bag.  Our flights were all late leaving the gates but kudos to our pilots for making up time and getting us to our destinations on time - no missed connections!  We were pleasantly surprised to find our seat assignments changed for one leg, from being seated separately near the back to side by side in Economy Plus. Thank you, United, for that. The minimum seat spacing (legroom) should be that much anyway; when a 5' 1"", 105# person is cramped for legroom it is unsafe, as well as uncomfortable. Now if they only would give us seats with padding and lumbar support!"
Jan 2020,50,Basic Economy for the win,"We took the red for a quick 3 nights in NYC. It was a girls trip, my sister and niece so we didn't mind if we didn't end up sitting together, we would be sleeping! This is the second time I've flown Uniteds basic economy in just a few months. We ended up sitting together on the way there but not on the way back. No biggie. We paid for two checked bags and even with that cost the flight was still less expensive than any other. Again, we slept so didn't have much interaction with anyone. But overall, a smooth trip during a very very busy time. I have been very pleased with United."
Jan 2020,30,Tight quarters for international flight,"We can't all get Business Class flights especially flying around the holidays but the seats small and tight which makes for a really cramped trip. And if you're lucky like me to sit with your back to the bulkhead, ie no reclining and have the person fully reclined in front of you forget about eating anything over your tray.    This service was in partnership with Lufthansa and I must say that one particular flight attendant was none to pleased to give water to me who was outside her zone. Think of German military gruffness :)"
Jan 2020,50,Great Customer Service,"My wife and I paid to have seats with extra legroom and to sit next to each other. When I printed my boarding passes, we were not in the seats I had paid for and we were in different rows. I called Customer Service and they immediately corrected the issue and sent me new boarding passes. They also refunded the cost for the seats. It was a great experience overall with United."
Jan 2020,10,Ms Love,I can’t believe that animals are no longer in crates. I’m highly allergic to animals but yet UA is allowing people to bring their pets on board without a crate and the animals stinks. This is intolerable and inconsiderate of people!
Jan 2020,10,Traveling with my 2 year old,"My husband, myself and our 2 year old received our seat assignments and as we were looking at them, we noticed United place all of us separate from each other and that included our 2 year old in her own seat 5 rows behind myself! Really????? So we asked them to reassign and the guy says, ""Well, that's what you get for buying economy."" He did change them, but how disgusting! I'm not going to have my 2 year old sit by herself separated from her mom and dad. Won't fly United again."
Jan 2020,20,U bite it,"Terrible OMG no welcome drink for ""Polaris"" they do not offer to make your bed up like other airlines do.  The blanket got lint all over my black pants what a mess, bring a lintbrush or don't wear black!  The salmon was inedible like eating cardboard the flight attendant says everyone complains it's overcooked, so really do something about it.  Small bathrooms, most airlines have bigger economy bathrooms, oh and dirty they never clean the bathrooms or refresh the toiletries during a flight.  Avoid this airlines if you can!"
Jan 2020,30,The end justifies the Means,The plane was nice and clean and the staff was friendly. We waited 2 hours on the tarmac before we could take off so we reached Germany 2 hours late.  We upgraded to economy plus  The food was terrible. Is is not possible to warm the rolls so they aren't so cold.  The flight was smooth and we arrived safely
Jan 2020,10,Very upset,We will never travel with United Airlines again and definitely will be sharing this info with family and friends. We got to our resort in Costa Rica this morning because of a delayed flight that ended up turning into a 8 hr layover which should have only been a 52 minutes layover. Our flight left us and our luggage was left in Houston. We lost almost a whole day of our vacay/anniversary. We had to spend another hr at the guest service desk to figure out where the luggages were and meanwhile our $190 we paid for transportation is going down the drain. We should have never traveled with them again to begin with because we already had a bad experience flying with them to Chicago. United does not even deserve a star.
Jan 2020,50,Impressed off the good service provided,It was my first long haul flight with United and I’ve been pleasantly impressed of the service they provide. The flight was with Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner which is a great plane. After this flight I also did a LHR-SFO round trip with a United 777-200 plane and the service was the same 😊
Jan 2020,10,Ms.,The flight was not bad but the food was horrible. 10.00 for a hot on a bun that was rock hard. The selection was crappy.
Jan 2020,10,ABSOLUTE WORST & MOST STRESSFUL FLIGHT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. AVOID AT ALL COST,"absolute worst & most stressful flight experience of my life.  United cancelled my flight two separate times with zero notification - no email, no text, nothing.  I called and spoke to multiple customer service agents for over 4 hours, was hung up on multiple times before someone added the flight back to my itinerary.    Once I was in Thailand, United, Again..cancelled my flight with no notification. I had to purchase a new flight in order to ensure I would not be stranded. avoid this airline at all cost, they are the worst airline I have ever dealt with."
Jan 2020,40,12 hour red-eye is doable,our return flight from Aukland on a bigger plane than the flight to Tahiti made a big difference. we paid extra for premium economy and selected a side aisle seat with only two seats in the row! this gave us a lot more room. the food on this flight was much better than the smaller plane. Much better. Good job of keeping people hydrated.
Jan 2020,10,Worst experience of my life,"I will never fly with United. Worst experience of our lives. On December 30, we had to fly from Montreal QC to Sao Paulo, with a layover in Washington DC. I was told 3 times on the phone we would NOT have to take our baggage during the layover as it would be sent directly to Sao Paulo. When we arrived to the Montreal airport we were told we would in fact have to take our baggage with us in Washington. Had we known this beforehand we would have packed as minimally as possible. We had to spend $150 on Uber just to get to the other airport with all our bags. Strike 1.    After waiting in Washington DC for 7 hours, we finally took off for two hours when the captain suddenly said that we had to go BACK to Washington because the wing was malfunctioning. WTF. People were freaking out the whole way back. How do you not check these things before you use a plane?! These are hundreds of lives you hold responsible. Strike 2.    When we got back to Washington DC at 2am, we were supposed to receive an email from United for hotel vouchers but 90% of the passengers never received it which resulted in a 2.5 hour line-up to get a hotel voucher. When it was finally our turn to get a voucher at 430am, the lady at the front desk said there were no more rooms available, especially because we were flying with two small dogs. Obviously we got very upset yet the manager had the audacity to tell us he was doing us a courtesy. WTF. It is NOT a courtesy when it was NOT our fault we had to return BACK to Washington because YOUR plane was having problems. It was only because my partner said she would sue them that the manager finally did what he could to find us a hotel. Our next flight would leave at noon that same day. Strike 3.    We were originally supposed to arrive to Sao Paulo on December 31 at 10:15am. We ended up arriving on January 1 at 3am.    THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY, TIME AND LIFE NEVER FLY WITH UNITED"
Jan 2020,10,I do not want to die yet!,"boarding was to start at 20.53 At 20.47 the announcement said You should be on the plane NOW! Last call we are leaving. I am 66 years old, my heart rate accelerated my body filled with flight or fight chemicals. The log will show the wheels were off the ground before 20.59 my ticket says wheels up 21.18. The crew was tired they wanted to get home and screw the passenger. The plane was half full of capacity. The pilot cooked the engines all the way home.  As we taxied the rear of the plane was filled with exhaust gas. Thank you I know diesel, gas, kerosene smells. The stewardess said she was getting sick and had a headache. My head wanted to explode. My lungs were burning filled with exhaust fumes."
Jan 2020,50,First time without any hiccups!,"On the trip over, we flew from Mobile to Houston to Chicago to Munich to Mumbai. United all the way to Munich, then Lufthansa to Mumbai. On the return trip, we flew non-stop Mumbai to Newark, then to Houston to Mobile. The first time I have ever flown any distance without any connection problems. We left the day before Thanksgiving, one of the busiest travel days of the year, so we were expecting some type of problem; weather, congestion, customs, etc. Two of the legs were 14+ hours, but everything went smoothly. We were amazed!"
Jan 2020,20,No Advantage For Advanced Booking,"Worst seat ever in an international flight being assigned the last seat by window. My airfare was paid months in advance. This seat had limited legroom as wheel well was on left side in front of me, they ran out of a choice for dinner and I could smell fuel as flight took off. Asking the person next to me when she booked her flight she replied, “last week”. This was a full flight. I sent an email expressing my concerns to United Airlines and they never responded!"
Jan 2020,10,Ridiculous,United is using the same airplanes that I flew in the 80s. It is like a step back in time. Then with many open seats they still want to charge you to move to a seat that actually has power to connect a device. Don't think you will watch a movie or tv on your flight either. Flying United is like buying meat off the back of the sketchy truck.
Jan 2020,50,Good Job with handicapped transit,"My wife walks with a cane and United did an excellent job helping her to and from Calgary even though we had to change planes in San Francisco (SFO) where the main runway was shut down, probably to use it as a homeless camp. United’s folks were uniformly helpful, courteous and cheerful."
Jan 2020,50,Pleasant surprise,"I last flew United in 2010 to Rome and it was a miserable flight; with the horror continuing on the return to the states. My granddaughter made these arrangements and United had greatly improved. The seating was much more comfortable, roomy, the  staff was so very pleasant. I went from never United to OK let's go United."
Jan 2020,50,Delayed but delightful,Weather caused delays in the flight but I was lucky enough to have a United Club pass so once I found the club I was able to enjoy complimentary wine and food. United used to be a very large presence at Seatac but now it is just a small component in one satellite terminal. The club staff were friendly and the flight crew were very professional and accommodating. The flight was uneventful and made up for some of the time delay.
Jan 2020,50,Thailand Adventure,On board service and entertainment was nice for the length of time we were on the flight. The food and beverage that were served was awesome.
Jan 2020,30,Acceptable,"We flew economy because of the short duration of the flight. My seat didn't recline (not that it reclines much anyway) and the flight attendant was kind enough to tell me that I could be reimbursed in miles for the inconvenience. I almost fell out of my seat. It's been forever since a flight attendant smiled, seemed to like her job and was proactive. Wish I remembered her name. So, all in all it was a pleasant enough flight. I''m still not pleased with the number of animals on board flights that are not service animals. One woman had a small dog in a carrier. the animal was obviously distressed and it was hard to watch her get angry when the dog should have not been on an airplane"
Jan 2020,50,Great flight as usual with United,"The flight was long but the flight attendants made an extra step to make it a pleasant flight from the check-in, the departure on time towards landing at SFO.  Well done!"
Jan 2020,10,Worst airline ever,"It was terrible. The boarding was like running cattle in a barn. We went thru the gate as first class, then loaded in a bus, taken out on the tarmac and dumped off to get on the plane as best you could. I will never fly United airlines again. Last year our flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues and again we had to do the best we could to find a flight to Cancun. 2 days later we finally arrived in Cancun , losing 2 days vacation. United airlines is a big joke"
Jan 2020,30,United isn’t great.,"On my recent flight from Mexico home to Houston, we were delayed by mechanical issues by an hour and 15 minutes after we were all loaded in the plane. Small cups of water were the only things offered. Once we were finally in the air the in flight movie wouldn’t work, and although we asked three times and were told it would be rectified, it never was. Disappointing considering how expensive United is."
Jan 2020,40,excellent experience,"After a chaotic situation at Newark a/p it was a big relieve the atmosphere and service we experienced on the flight to Portugal. Especially the crew on this flight, leaving on the 7th of January, was great.  Thank you so much."
Jan 2020,30,Flight got me to my destination,"We flew LAX/SFO/AUK and SYD/SFO/LAX. The 13 hour flight was long but fine. The staff on the plane were fine, nothing special to the good or the bad. Food was HORRIBLE! And I complained. I couldn't eat most of it. P:lane was crowded and I am glad we paid the extra for the larger economy space. Shorter flight I wouldn't spend the money. Customs in SFO was interesting at best and I think it could be better handled than is. Be prepared for gathering your luggage and getting it checked back in. Fortunately for us, my husband is handicapped and we needed a wheelchair The assistant knew their way and I am still thanking them!"
Jan 2020,40,Marathon Trip to Australia,"Well after a 6 hour flight from DC to LA, I continued on for a 16 hour flight from LA to Melbourne, Australia!! What a haul. If I wasn't going to see my family at the end of the journey, I would never have lasted!!! Wasn't too bad from DC to LA but after that: well?!! The crew from both flights were very helpful and accommodating!! I was able to gat some sleep on the Melbourne flight as they had all the lights low and quiet reigned!! I was in Economy Plus which was just a small step above Economy but not in the Premium category. I am glad I made the effort since it wasn't as bad as I had imagined!!!!"
Jan 2020,10,Completely rude and incompetent agent,"I had a business class ticket from Boston to Auckland connecting on to another country. I secured a NZ transit visa since I was only connecting through Auckland for 2 hours and not entering the country as a tourist.    UA gate agent was mandating I needed a full tourist visa to check in and refused to issue a boarding pass.    I called the NZ embassy who then contacted immigration in Auckland. I was told that UA had misclassified me as an “inbound” tourist and not a transit passenger and that was the problem.    I told the UA agent who continued to refuse to help me, in a very rude and obnoxious manner. I ask for a supervisor who also would not listen or help.    Finally another UA agent, total angel, said “let me try” and I had a boarding pass in 10 minutes after waiting 2 hours with these other agents. The agents obviously disliked their job and/or providing customer service. I never felt such contempt, especially in a situation which was clearly an error on their part.    Totally crazy and unnecessary. Their mistake cost me an extra $77 to get a full NZ visa that I didn’t need and UA would not reimburse me for their error."
Jan 2020,10,Spend your money on another airline,"Using this airline was the worst flying experience I've ever had and I never write these type of reviews. We had our flight delayed about an hour and a half on the way to Charleston because a flight attendant did not come in and we sat on the plane waiting to take off on the runway. Our flight was delayed 3 hours on the way back and I have never had this much trouble flying, so a two hour flight to New York turned into a five to six hour ordeal. We should not be dealing with all these problems especially after paying a couple hundred per ticker and paying for a checked bag. I appreciate the employees offering snacks and sympathy, but at the end of the day this is unacceptable for the cost."
Jan 2020,40,"Ontime, nice crew, small plane!","We were pleasantly surprised by United. Boarding was quick, only 50 passengers. Seats were comfortable for a small aircraft. The crew member was friendly and offered and quick beverage service on the short flight. Baggage was delivered quickly on arrival in EWR."
Jan 2020,10,this airline is absolute garbage,Our flight was delayed due to a “prior” incident. This is a complete lie. There has been absolutely perfect weather today and the odds are in our favor for a smooth and ON TIME flight. The gate for the flight continually varied and changes throughout the day so that it is practically impossible to get to the flight within a reasonable time. There was no leg room whatsoever. The only GOOD THING about this airline is the scent of the lavatory. It is a soothing citrusy orange scent that gives you a moment to a break from the bland aura of the airplane.
Jan 2020,40,Better Flight Experience This Time,Much improved service on this recent flight. Fly this route on a regular basis for over 10 years. This was one of the better trips that I have flown. Much of the improvement is due to the full-size Airbus used on the flight. Many flights were on a small ExpressJet ERJ-145. One of the smallest regional jets. The onboard crew and Houston gate staff were pleasant and efficient. The upgrades to food at Houston Bush are a welcome change. United is trying to improve.
Jan 2020,30,Cancun,Very disappointed with the service in business class. The stewards were not friendly and the snack selections were very bad for nothing was available. In Cancun United airways have no lounge and the service was as bad. Thank God for safety the Pilots flew the plans well.
Jan 2020,50,flying united vancouver to rome,having no choice(Lufthansa on strike)We were forced to fly united vcr to denver/newark then rome having just 45 min between changing planes i had ideas that are bags would not show up on arrival rome.Well united gave up great service and very comfortable  seats and yes our bags arrived with us well done United
Jan 2020,30,3 hours late departure on second leg,The initial leg from Toronto was excellent but we had a long delay in HOuston due to late flight arrival and then no crew available which made us 3 hours late in getting to Zihua and necessitated finding condo in the dark.
Jan 2020,10,Worst in providing service,"Service is not good, the staff at the checking section are rude, they don't allow hand carry, we need to pay for that. I would suggest to book the flight in other airlines, as other airlines allow the passenger to carry hand carry with some personal carrier bag like laptop bag, or small bag."
Jan 2020,30,Mixed emotions,"Never having travelled with United before, I was pleasantly surprised with the legroom and excellent cabin crew. The food was standard fayre and not anything special. My gripe would be that if the seat allocation. Even as a couple we were expected to sit 13 rows apart and was informed by the gate crew that this was our fault due to not booking directly with the airline. No amount of phone calls or complaining would illicit a satisfactory response. Only by the grace of understanding single passengers and the excellent steward did we manage to sit together. I must add that I booked the seat within 20 minutes of the booking facility opening and I’ve never had this problem with any other airline."
Jan 2020,30,Good,"Average Trip. Check-in was standard. Was traveling with a group so I could not pre-print boarding pass. No problems though, I got boarding passes when I checked bags. Husband and I in different boarding zones but we both got boarding just fine. Average seats in Economy (not comfortable but not uncomfortable). There was available storage for carry-on luggage. Please flight attendants and crew."
Jan 2020,40,Good flight; on time and good cabin pressure.,UA does good work on a crowded flight. Not much to say except that it was on time and served snacks and drinks.
Jan 2020,50,No problems,"I think we had a small delay for a take off from our lay-over in Chicago, but the pilot made it up in the air and it was NBD. The crew and staff were friendly and kind. Non-eventful flight, which are always the best kind."
Jan 2020,30,Dissatisfied with service,"Recently we flew to Waikiki in January 2020 and booked our flight on-line. I've traveled all over the world and wanted to pass along some tips that may help others.    Pros:  We booked our flight in December (January departure) and on a Wednesday, which was recommended by experts and got a great deal (for the time & month) to Hawaii (Oahu).    We paid just over $1,800.00 for 4 adults but didn't include checked baggage which amounted to $30.00 per bag. By the end of the year prices rose to over $4,000.00 (high end)! This was possibly due to the shortage of planes (grounding of the new max 737).    Cons:  After completing our flight reservation over the ""phone,"" I was informed that each ""carry-on would cost $40.00!!!"" ""Seriously!""    That would've cost us $320.00 for 4 (round trip). However, at the airport they never asked us and we were allowed to carry our backpacks on board. I was relieved and someone said that it only applied to passengers carrying ""luggage with wheels?"" Why couldn't the ""representative"" on the phone tell me that? Without going into detail, I was later told it was their marketing strategy? Really!? What a scam!    At boarding, passengers with these bags (carry on with wheels) were stopped and their bags were tagged and set aside to be checked under the plane. I assume the bags were to large for the overhead bins?    In flight extras:  Very limited selection of movies. ""Wifi is unavailable"" if your destination is the Hawaiian Islands because the signal is lost over the Pacific Ocean.    Snacks vary in price from $4.00 - $10.00. There is complimentary crackers and a beverage of your choice but no in-flight meals.    Conclusion:  Getting great fares can come with hidden add (question everything. If you don't ask, they won't tell you!) on fares, which you won't necessarily know about unless you ask. Do your due diligence (research), plan accordingly (book @ least 30 days in advance), and have a great flight."
Jan 2020,30,Squished !,Even premium economy were were crammed in like sardines. Very uncomfortable for a 8-9 hour flight. VERY. We felt squished ! The food was mediocre. A bad experience. Not enjoyable at all. Poor flight entertainment. Dirty bathrooms.
Jan 2020,50,First Class - It's worth it!,What a treat! We've recently flown first class to New York twice and what a treat it is! It is totally worth the extra expense. From the moment you board you are treated well and given their undivided attention. From the warm nuts and cocktail to the big reclining seat with tons of leg room - it was all perfect!
Jan 2020,50,Long flight,Long flight got to be difficult with about two hours to go. Since I am tall there wasn't much leg room so it was hard to stretch out legs. When eating meals provided I was shoulder to shoulder and elbow to elbow with others. This year when I return to London I have gotten step up in seating so there will be extra room.
Jan 2020,40,Good timing,The connections in Denver going and coming were quick and efficient.I had less than one hour to change planes. The gates were close. No wasted time. Really good.
Jan 2020,30,Hawaii,"We upgraded our flight to Honolulu to get more legroom and for the extra bag. We ended up paying for the extra bag anyway regardless of our flight status. The extra legroom wasn't a good deal and I'd never do that again on this airline. Service was ok.  We were really disappointed with the flight, the seating and the overall experience. Probably not flying United anytime in the near future."
Jan 2020,30,Premium - not very premium,"Paid quite a bit of money for an upgrade on this 12+ hour overnight flight and was underwhelmed by the attention I received. No drink service was offered before the dinner option(published menu said drinks and nuts served before the meal); Meals were tasteless and served lukewarm to cold; and aside from an occasional water bottle being passed down the row, we received little care or service. Not worth the money to upgrade"
Jan 2020,40,Signs of Improvement,"Having long suffered with United Airlines to the point where they became my airline of last choice, I was pleasantly surprised. The attitude of the crew was welcoming and helpful. The meal was well above average. I will consider United again in the future and hope this change is more widespread."
Jan 2020,30,The usual,"Flew from Newark to Punta Cana. The flight was safe and on time, the most important factors. As usual, the seats are way too cramped and the boarding process is a cattle call, but this is now par for the course if you fly economy anywhere."
Jan 2020,10,Flight to Maui was a horribble experience,"My wife and I flew from San Francisco to Maui on 12/8/19 and United cost us an entire day of our vacation. We lost a Hotel reservation that was prepaid at $700.00 that we couldn’t even use. They had to turn back the plane to San Fran because they did not have a piece of equipment that was required to fly over the ocean. They would not honor our higher cost seats that we had paid for more than 6 months previously on the next flight, and to add insult to injury we had to wait for a 3rd night flight that was also further delayed. We were informed that when we arrived at our gate for the final later flight that we would be provided a document for some compensation, but no one at that gate had any idea what we were speaking about. We arrived in Maui approx. 9 hours late that night. When we arrived home a week later, they lost our luggage for more than an additional day without any explanation. On top of that, they made us pay for luggage at $60 each even though we booked with Chase United cards. I used to love flying United and I've always deflected the horror stories from other travelers regarding the airline, but the airline just keeps getting less reliable and less accommodating."
Jan 2020,20,Board room passes change,"I flew a great international flight on anothr airline. However I arrived at the airport early and thought I could use my Club pass that would expire in February. To my surprise, United has changed their policy and now you have to be flying on a United flight to use the Club passes. It didn't matter I had purchased the $1500 ticket with my United Chase card. So I contacted their customer service and received a very lame response from ""Nancy"" , no last name, in their customer service department, saying, Sorry"" you didn't know the policy had changed. They are so bad at customer service. The airline I did flybwas fabulous. I'll write a positive review about them. I am so disappointed in United's apparent inability to get their act together!"
Jan 2020,10,Horrible service by stewardess!,"United Airlines Complaint    To whom it may concern,    I fly a fair amount and this have never happened to me before. This incident occurred on flight UA 1614, Ft. Lauderdale to Chicago-O’Hare departing Ft. Lauderdale at 6:00am on 12/7/19.    I came out of the mid-plane bathroom and the stewardess (No.1) with a service cart just passed me and was passing out refreshments. I come up to her and told her I would like to get by since my seat was at the back of the plane. She said, “what am I going to do with the cart”? The plane was not full, so there were a lot of places where I could stand in a row and have the cart moved back so that I could pass. To answer her question, I told her that she could move the cart back just a row or two to allow me to pass. She responded by saying “I am on a time deadline” implying she could not do it. I responded by saying, all you have to do is move the cart back for a few seconds to let me pass, but then she responded and said, “I DON’T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING!”. I tried one more time to ask to get by and she responded, “you are going to have to wait until I get to your seat”, so I had to wait for her to serve half of the plane before I could get back to my seat.    While she was serving the passengers a second stewardess (No. 2) came, from the back of the plane, to the other side of the cart and started helping her. She saw what was going on and said nothing. There were multiple opportunities along the way for me to step into a row to allow me to pass because the plane had many empty seats, but for some unknown reason this stewardess just didn’t want to treat me fairly. I have been in this situation in the past where this is standard operating procedure. I described this situation to one of the stewardess on my return flight (UA 2031) and she said that this was “clearly unacceptable behavior and the stewardess should be disciplined”.    I know that to file a complaint I needed to get the name of the offending stewardess (No. 1), so later in the flight when stewardess number two was walking up the aisle, I stopped and asked her what is the name of stewardess number one working the cart and she told me “Lisanna” (I am not sure if this is the correct spelling of the name she told me, but it’s my best guess). My first thought was, this is a strange name, but it’s her name. As I was deplaning I saw a third stewardess (No. 3) that stayed up front and was not part of this affair, so I thought I would “triple check” the name of the offending stewardess (No. 1). I asked her, is the name of one of the stewardess’ Lisanna? She looked at me puzzled. I tried the name again and she started still looked confused, so I asked her for the name of the black stewardess (No. 1) with straight hair, this was a distinguishing feature. She told me her name was “X”. So now I understood, stewardess number two (who is also black but had her hair in an afro) was helping X and was covering for her by giving me the wrong name. The stewardess (No. 3) that gave me the correct name is white and I am telling this for identification purposes only since I didn’t get the names of the other two stewardesses (No. 2 & 3). Furthermore, this is not a race issue since I am black myself. This is an issue of professionalism and common decency. I won’t be fully satisfied until I receive a video apology from X. This can easily be accomplished by sending the video directly to my e-mail.    I sent this letter to United. Their response was “we will look into it” which is code word for doing nothing, so this is why I am to telling the world about the horrible service on United.    -Tim (DSZYY2)"
Jan 2020,40,Nice Direct Flight,"Great flight and timing. Being direct flight and not to wait is pretty convenient. You board in the evening and watch some movie/sleep, you are landing at 5am to get a decent start next day. Please make sure you have United airline app on your mobile to watch inflight entertainment.    Chicago - MAui is convenient as well. We board UA202 at 10 and landed at 3.45pm and you can settle down for that day to get a decent start next day."
Jan 2020,20,No leg room,We flew from Sydney to London via San Francisco. We had a refurbed 777 which has gone from a 3-3-3 seat configuration. It's now a 3-4-3 which is so uncomfortable. Lots of airlines are doing this. Not comfortable.
Jan 2020,20,This plane was DIIIIRRRRTTTYYY!,"When I got to my seat, it STUNK as if someone had just finished smoking a pack of cigarettes in that seat! I couldn't even look out of the window because the stench of nicotine was too much (my boyfriend could smell it from his seat next to me)! There was coffee stains on the overhead from someone spilling during turbulence or something. It was just so dirty! When I got to my final destination, I got sick within 24 hours from that flight. It was gross."
Jan 2020,20,Rough flight from the departure to the arrival.,NOTE : This review is for Flight UA253 on 12/17/2019  Continental was way better back in the day I've never been so disappointed with flying until now this flight going to our dream vacation in Hawaii. Tickets were 758.52 per person (3x) then they charge your additional $24.00 per seat (3x) Basic Economy Seat Assignment on the way there and another $34.00 per seat (3x) Basic Economy Seat Assignment on the way back. You have to buy food during the flight. $30.00 for checked bag each way. Talk about splitting hairs and nickel and diming for revenue. The in-flight wireless internet/entertainment connection was broken and Filght attendants were expected to troubleshoot the issue. Person who sat in front of me had a broken seat and the young Flight attendants didn't really care to help him except for one guy towards the end of the trip. Really this is horrible. I've never expected domestic flight to be so shoddy. Plus I was scared if they were going to breakup a family and eject someone from the flight to make room for some other person that paid extra. What the heck? Is this the result of corporate merger between United and Continental?
Jan 2020,10,Horrible experience,"Most worst airline I ever experienced    I was traveling to shanghai china from Houston flight we were on was not started so they make us deplane and re board another flight due to this we missed our regular flight and one later flight . When we arrived at San Francisco airport real drama start customer service person was very rude she didn't want to serve us but she started and just print new boarding pass, hotel voucher and food voucher.  No explanation for how to get hotel ride. On top of we have to pick up our baggage. We literally have to wait almost 2 hour to get our baggage. Again that person also very rude both person who attended they don't feel value of customers they just treat like they were obliged to us for talking to us.  Ultimately it is horrible experience. Food voucher theybgave us that is nothing good for us as we are vegetarian and there is no restaurant have vegetarian options. When we told that just answer rude pay your own united will not reimburse.    This how they treat customer.  I will never go with them again."
Jan 2020,10,Horrible!,"Damaged my checked bag and lost the carry on that was checked curbside as I was boarding. Spent 2 hours at the airport trying to locate my bag with no luck. Every time I have called, I have spent 30-60 minutes on hold. A week and a half later, my bag has still not been located and I have been told it will take another 10-12 weeks to reimburse me once my claim has been approved."
Jan 2020,30,"Flight was late, so I missed my connecting flight.","Disappointed my flight out of Fargo to Denver was late, so I missed my connecting flight to Seattle. ( It was very cold outside, I think the plane would not start. No hot beverages on board either.) The good news is that United Customer Service, at their 800 number, allowed me to fly on Alaska airlines from Denver to Seattle instead of waiting 6 hr. in Denver."
Jan 2020,20,Flight destination was changed with no warning,"Last Sunday Jan 5th, United Airlines had changed my flight destination from SDU (Rio domestic) to GIG (Rio international) with no warning. I could realize it only at time to check-in at Chicago-ORD and obviously was not good for my planned trip. It was not fair."
Jan 2020,10,Never again,"Terrible treatment. 8 hours late for our tour bus. No weather problem at all... the United employees passed the blame from one person, reason, to another. By far the WORST airline experience EVER!!!!"
Jan 2020,40,Comfortable aisle seat,Flew in economy class from Honolulu (HNL) to Los Angeles (LAX). Received lounge access and priority boarding with this Star Alliance airline. Aisle seat was roomy and comfortable.
Jan 2020,50,Incredible & Unexpected arrival in Houston!,"I was stunned… and at my age, I don’t get surprised easily. I flew from ABQ to Miami today, with a change of planes in Houston. As I stepped into the jetway in Houston, I was met and surprised by Ms. Jo Jones, from United Airlines, who escorted me down the jetway stairs to the tarmac and into a chauffeured Mercedes for a very personal transfer to a United Club near the gate for my connecting flight. I fly very often on United and I buy expensive tickets, but I am not in any way one of their top-tier elite customers. In any event, congratulations United… you made my day!"
Jan 2020,50,It wasn't a fully booked flight but,The staff was just as friendly and nice as I expected from United Airlines. The only issue was with how the flight was not fully booked but yet I was assigned a seat far from my travel companions. Other than that everything was excellent.
Jan 2020,50,i dont fly that often.....once every couple years but i managed to learn a lot from my minimal experience.,"I take a laptop for entertainment....games, movies etc. i noticed the first couple times i barely had room to open the 15(?) incher ...totally unuseable and going from Fresno to Chicago can be tedious and b oring. Yes they do have movies via your smart phone (free movies). I wanted to use the laptop so i went ahaed and got the Premium Economy seat for an additional amount and BOOM its a whole new ballgame for me and my laptop!!!  and btw for those who dont know NO transfers, changing planes etc.....its a STRAIGHT shot from Fresno to Chicago....again, it may be cheaper if you choose to fly all over the country and then land in chicago .  we are 70ish and we were very satisfied...i guess thats the new norm for us. We bought our tickets in March 2019"
Jan 2020,40,Professional Service and Fast Boarding,My first flight with United was a nice experience althought take-off was delayed for about half an hour. The boarding process was well organized and all passengers were on the aircraft ahead of take-off time. The in-flight service was really good and flight attendants were care taking and friendly! I am going to use United again due to the professional service offered.
Jan 2020,10,No access to lounge in Toronto if flying business class,"When flying to the US from Toronto you pass customs/immigration at the Toronto airport and these steps are difficult to time. Therefore arriving with extra time is a good idea and the potential waiting time until the flight leaves can be made more enjoyable in the airline lounge. Access to it is normally automatic when flying business class.  This is not the case in Toronto. The lounge is only available to gold members or something like that. I have PAID for the ticket. It was not an upgrade.  You sock, United"
Jan 2020,50,Great Service Experienced,"Excellent Service, nice new plane, on-time, can't ask for anything more. Try their Club as it sure beats waiting at gate and will check you in there too."
Jan 2020,40,777,"Big plane, big seats, super comfy, and on time. What else could you ask for besides skinny seat mates?"
Jan 2020,30,Check In Kiosk experience was not really convenience when you have a checked in luggage.,"With checked in luggage, you can't check in early in the app. At the airport, you must go a certain area to check your luggage especially, when your expected check-in counter or terminal is different, when you have small children, it is definitely not easy route. We had to walk with big luggage to change the terminal 1 to terminal 2.    In flight, there is only 1 attendant, you can't imagine how the single personal can help one at a time.. maybe it is because of the size of the plane."
Jan 2020,30,mixed kinds of experience,"I took flight 835 to Shanghai on 9/12/2019. The flying was fine, smooth and on time. But a couple of Asian attendants were very rude. They openly spoke to passengers in a assaulting manner. I flew back 9/26/2019 on flight 836. it was a much better experience. Although the plane was fuller, the attendants handled very well. I was thinking to complain to United after I came back. But I was told any comment should be made within 2 weeks."
Jan 2020,50,Unbelievably Smooth Trip,"We used points to get an Economy Plus seat first my wife and Economy for me. The flight left right on time and arrived 20 minutes early. It was smooth flying all the way. The Segway I use for mobility assistance was already waiting for me in the gateway when I deplaned, and our bags arrived at the carousel before we did. The entire trip cross -country was just over 6 hrs from departure time to arrival at our home 39 miles from the airport. That’s gotta be a record of some sort."
Jan 2020,10,Worst business class trip ever,"First, on the flight to Germany a week prior we had a lousy steward who was so busy chatting up the stewardesses he couldn’t get around to us. We ended the flight with all our garbage since he didn’t make it back through the cabin. The short rib dinner was so tough you couldn’t even cut the meat. On the way home we we’re hoping for a better experience but we’re even more disappointed. To avoid the short ribs we ordered the chicken only to be told the we’re out. My wife settled on the fish and I went back to the short ribs. When they served my wife the fish the stewardess apologized that she forgot to put my ribs in the oven and it would be another 20 minutes before they were ready or I could have the vegetarian pasta. So I went for the pasta. Then on arrival we had a choice of pizza or a snack. We opted for the pizza but once again we’re told they were out but we could have one of the economy meals. Really not sure why we spent the extra for business class."
Jan 2020,40,Mileage flight,The flight wasn'r so bad with the exception that the Media was out on the plane and we were told it has been out and they had no idea when it would be working. One thing that bothered me is the flight was almost 8 hours and only pretzels were given out and anything else had to be purchased. On other Airlines anything over 6 hours you receive some kind of meal.
Jan 2020,30,O.K. Nothing special.,"I travel frequently from Denver to Los Angeles. UAL is my carrier of choice as Denver is one of their hubs and they ""used to"" have a wide selection of flights to choose from throughout a given day. I say used to because they recently reduced the number of available flights to and from LAX. I'm, hoping this was due to an equipment shortage when the MAX was taken off line and that this will change when it comes back on line. I'm locked in to their frequent flyer program, so not a big incentive to fly another carrier. Am I satisfied? I'd say lukewarm. On time departure and arrival is pretty good. But like all airlines, the earlier in the day you travel the better your odds. I have perks because of my status that are helpful. Without the perks I'd be price shopping. If you do, however, make sure you compare apples to apples. Many carriers (not UAL that I'm aware of) have hidden fees that can surprise you at the last moment, typically when you're checking in or even at the gate when they've got you by the short and curlies, and you have little choice but to pay. Some carriers even separate families then charge extra to allow you to sit together, including children. So, be careful."
Jan 2020,40,United Airlines flights,"the flights from Toronto to Houston and Houston to Guatemala were pleasant,  crew on board were professional and courteous. Flights were reasonably on time  considering that it was a connecting flight. Both flighs were full of passengers during the pre-christmas season. I have no problem recomending United Airlines for travel,  weather in economy class of other cabins."
Jan 2020,20,The Bad Dreamliner,The Boeing Dreamliner has the most uncomfortable seats and most expensive premium economy upgrade EVER. The bathrooms were smelly/dirty from takeoff.
Jan 2020,40,Older jet but was comfortable enough,"Same size jet that we came to Charlotte on but an older one from the fleet. Still, it was comfortable but it is the little things like the torn seat pocket in front of me.    FA served a meal but we had already eaten so passed on it. He was a bit too chatty and ended up talking to the lady in front of us in the bulk head who had too much to drink. Even my noise cancelling headphone did not keep me from hearing their conversation    Very strong head winds so it was a VERY bumpy flight."
Jan 2020,50,Nice jet and friendly flight crew,"Hadn't flown this route in ages, the jet was the Embrajer with a small first class. They served a decent lunch, a cold chicken wrap with salad. FC FA was great. Flight landed early due to a strong tail wind but we had to sit and wait for a gate to open up."
Jan 2020,30,New Tricky Luggage Policy,"We fly overseas frequently. For the first time, we would be charged for the check-in luggage b/c we booked 'basic economy.' Never experience this before! Kinda ridiculous to pay extra since we already paid the ticket. But the new airplanes are roomy, enough leg rooms for me (5'3"")"
Jan 2020,50,"Polaris seats, Luxury blankets and comforters, comfortable seats","All Business class seats are not alike.  This Polaris, business class seat 💺 from Brussels to Newark is one of the most comfortable. The seat has user friendly controls to change from upright to bed, and it works and doesn’t feel confined but rather snuggly.  I especially like the cubby to put electronics or books or water bottle into for easy retrieval."
Jan 2020,10,Deceptive Rewards Program—Avoid,"I understood that, as a United Plus rewards member, I am entitled to a free checked bag and seating upgrades. This greatly influenced my decision to join United’s mileage program. I am incredibly frustrated and disappointed to learn that there are many exceptions to United’s Reward benefits. Part of my recent trip was through a United partner, Luftansa. Partners do not honor United’s benefit. When told at checkin that I would have to pay to check a bag, I called United Customer Service to confirm and was RUDELY told by the customer service representative that because this was another airline I was not entitled to my free checked bag and that this reward benefit applies only to domestic flights. The customer service representative then admonished me that this was somehow communicated to me in the red tape/small print. It’s bad enough that the rewards benefits are bait and switch, but then to be treated like an imbecile by a customer service representative is unacceptable. I won’t even go into how I was unable to use any of my 100,000 points to upgrade my seat. I strongly urge anyone to avoid United’s mileage plus program."
Jan 2020,50,Amazingly good!,"After some mediocre trips on UA, this was a very positive exception.  The flight left on time.  The flight attendants were attentive, and courteous. For a flight that leaves at 7:30am, they were friendly and efficient. (I was still half-asleep :) ).  The food was... oh, no, it wasn't. But they did have some boxes, for sale.  The flight crew was phenomenal, keeping us informed, and arriving 25 minutes EARLY!  I just hope future UA flights are as good!"
Jan 2020,10,Horrible service!,"Pay more for other airlines if you must, but don’t waste money on the United Airlines.    They made my wife and I sit in two separate rows and not even close ones.  Customer service response: “Sorry sir! We can’t help you further!”."
Jan 2020,50,Round Trip to HI was awesome!,Non-Stop trip from Denver was great. Staff was fantastic and the flight was on-time both ways and very smooth.
Jan 2020,30,Just OK,The flight was just OK. The seats are pretty tight and cramped for a long flight. We were served dinner and breakfast. The food was typical airline food. The flight left on time and arrived a few minutes early.
Jan 2020,10,Worst service ever,"Fly business with United :  First surprise : after a 14h long trip from NZ, no access to business lounge.  Second surprise: business passagers don’t get priority boarding. We boarded about 25th in line.  Famed US quality of service has clearly gone down the drain."
Jan 2020,30,Worst aircraft I have ever flew with,"We had one of the oldest aircrafts of United! First they where one hour delayed!  My seat had the light broken so I couldn’t read the whole flight as it was during the night, I decided then watch a movie and the panel had problems with the touch option so it took me a long time to see the options and choose the movie! When I finally could choose the movie the connection of my headphones was damage and I had to move it every 5 min sonI can hear the movie.  The bathrooms where dirty the hole flight (4.5 hours of flight) United must change all his aircrafts or fixe the things that are not working for the passengers."
Jan 2020,50,FlyBusness,"It was worth the extra cost. Good Service, Good Hot Meal, Close to the Rest Room, On-Off Quickly. However, we have found that the United Business Class is $500 more than Alaskas First. We will try Alaska in Februaey. $1,000 diference will buy a lot of Chardonny."
Jan 2020,40,Great movie selections,"10 and half hour flight. its a typical economy class flight. one thing I can say about this flight is they have a lot of movie selections. negative part is, the food are not that great so bring some snacks."
Jan 2020,10,United First Class a joke!,"Paying full fare for a first class ticket was a waste! Usually you are offered a choice of beverages when you board. Not on this flight. Only after the entire plane boarded and the door closed, the flight attendant came with a tray full of plastic cups filled with lukewarm water! They don’t have ice in first class? It only got worse. The meal was some kind of Indian (?) chicken with chunks of tofu. It was horrible tasting and the spices were overwhelming. Totally inedible. The flight was in the USA, what is wrong with some semblance of American food? If I wanted to eat this type of food I would have traveled to a Third World Country! Who are they trying to impress with their “global” menu?  The service wasn’t exactly stellar either. What happened to the warm cookie? Never offered that. A word of warning: If you are flying First Class, choose another airline. I think it’s time for us to change!"
Jan 2020,50,"Awesome crew, on time flight.","Left early actually, I was told that this service is going away and for that I am sad. But I am hoping that enough people use it to bring it back. Christmas Day and there were 10 people on the flight. That should mean something."
Jan 2020,30,"Delayed flight, but I did like the way they did it","The flight got delayed about 2 hours, but the staff gave us updates everytime, they give us beverage and food, and were really patient, but people say the flight Houston - El Salvador always got delay, so be careful"
Jan 2020,40,Christmas trip,I chose to do this flight basic economy. While overall it worked out ok I would not recommend it for an extended stay. We lucked out getting aisle and window seats for both legs. I think that was an anomaly and normally you will be stuck in the middle in this class you do not get choice of seat assignment and no carryon. If seat assignment and carryon do not matter to you then this is a viable option.
Jan 2020,50,Cheerful Crew,The crew was extremely nice even though it was Christmas day. They went out of their way to make the flight great even though it was delayed multiple times (blown tire and then somebody got sick in the aisle while people were boarding)
Jan 2020,50,On time,"Tight connection as we got held up in Mobile by the Houston airport but we made it. Flight was otherwise uneventful. Coming home, we were again slightly delayed leaving Houston. We did see the United personnel go out of their way to assist an elderly woman travelling with her toddler granddaughter and her daughter who was in a wheelchair. They were very kind to them. Main complaint about flying United is being routed through Houston every time. Not a huge fan of that airport."
Jan 2020,30,Better than first leg from Lima but not by much!,After a very substandard business class flight from Lima we connected to San Francisco. Flight was OK but again a very disinterested level of service. Light breakfast was nice. Lack of overhead bin space as one family of 4 took up all the space down one side of the first class area which left little room for the remaining passengers in this section.
Jan 2020,40,On time and easy connection,"Flights were on time and connection was easy. Only complaint was that the attendant didn’t call out for the different sections, so even though we had priority boarding, we were near the end of the line."
Jan 2020,50,Frendly staff made a difference,"Very frendly staff from ams to iad on the 27th. Gooed flight from msy to iad on the 3rd and even better on the flight from iad to ams that day. Special thanks to Renske who was very friendly. On the short flights within the US they have no fresh food for sale, only snackboxes. Coffee and drinks are offered plenty, so nothing to complain. Warm meal was good and offered with frendly hospitallity.. Inflight entertainment only offered on long flights snd movies, music if you like. Very few dutch titled, but for me not an issue. Bring your own headphone (with standard 3,5 mm plug) because theirs are not so good, but what can you expect for free. Thank you so much for having me snd give me a pleasant trip. Your staff really made it very good. Upgrade to economy plus is a good idea and legspace enourmous then."
Jan 2020,50,Friends 70th birthday surprise,My friend was 70 and we were coming to New York for her birthday celebrations. She had also lost her mum and I had lost both my parents in the same year and were both looking forward to our new year in New York.  I contacted the airline to let them know about my friends visit and they not only upgraded us but also surprised her with a visit to the cockpit and then we had a bottle of champagne and photos taken with the crew on the aircraft. We were also given a bottle of champagne and some goodies to take with us on our onward journey to continue the celebration.  My friend was overwhelmed with the surprise and was in shock but was so overwhelmed with the generosity of United airlines. She says she will remember this for the rest of her life. I can’t thank them enough especially Ryan hood who made this happen for us and Andy at Manchester Airport. Thank you
Jan 2020,50,Return home after holidays,Asked for and received a needed wheelchair assist after release from hospital. Personnel gave tlc assist at terminal and on/off plane. Flight left exactly on time . Fare was very reasonable.
Jan 2020,50,Friendly and no stress,Staff from curb side check in to the flight attendants were all friendly and smiling. Flight got in 40 minutes early! I miss the extra free bag by using our Mileage Plus card to take my golf clubs. It was one of the reasons I didn't look at any other airlines. I don't like the nickle and diming of the cheaper airlines.
Jan 2020,40,Conference Travel,"I choose to fly connecting flights to the U.S. through Narita, Japan. Although you have to do customs/immigration control through Japan for connecting international flights, using an international flight allows me to choose flights with shorter layovers, and meals are available on the longer flight legs. Booking on the SPN-GUM leg is usually full flight, so if you have a roller carryon sometimes there is no room in the overhead bins. Flight staff could be a friendlier, and help passengers with finding room for carryon bags. Flights between Saipan and Guam are very short (approx. 30 min.), no meal is served."
Jan 2020,50,Amazing customer service!!!,"Outstanding help and support when calling! For the first time since I started traveling in 2008 this was my first flight I have EVER missed due to my own negligence! I called in a panicked but they quickly calmed me down and put me on the same exact flight home the next day with no charges!! Oh my lord what a relief, and made travel so much easier!! Thanks United you gained a new customer to always check your flights and prices!!! (Hugs!!)"
Jan 2020,50,"Decent flight, but everything is an up-charge??","I don’t know if United Airlines is hurting financially or not. But why continue to nickel and dime passengers for everything if not in first class? Catch up to Delta and start putting customer experience first! Now flight attendants etc were ok, some seemed aggravated during work which I can understand. Gate agents were good no issues there. Seats and TVs etc all seemed very “dirty” like a good deep clean or power wash is way way overdue. Altogether why it’s a 7/10. Thanks!"
Jan 2020,50,Faultless service,"Great to see the older, more experienced employees being the cabin crew. A smooth flight even though it was a l-o-n-g one! In flight movies were great!"
Jan 2020,20,Why I will not fly United Airlines again,"Traveling with my 2 grown children and 3 year old grandson from Miami back to NYC. TSA at Miami Airport was very slow and as result we got to the gate 11 minutes before the plane departed at 4:12pm. UA person told us we were bumped from the flight because we were late. We told to sit down and they would get back to us. 5 minutes later they let another passenger on the plane. No explanation.We were put on a plan leaving at 8:55pm getting into Newark at 11:55pm and the 3 year old not sitting with any on us.We had to ask for seat changed so that the toddler could sit with his mother. Staff came over to me and said that she wasn't going to get ""in trouble"" because we were late. I called UA to complain and supervisor said that this should not have happened and she would do an investigation and get back to me with vouchers. Never heard from her. Will not fly with this airline again. They don't care about the passengers at all!"
Jan 2020,50,Great Flight with very attentive Crew,Would be great to be able to afford First Class for every flight. Great service both legs and on time. Would recommend the non-stop from Denver. Takes the hassles out of changing planes in either LA or San Fran.
Jan 2020,40,Comfortable New York Trip,"We were pleasantly surprised with the comfort on this trip - especially on the return lag where we were kindly upgraded. The staff were very friendly on bot trips, and found the whole experience trouble free. Food on return leg left a bit to be desired, especially for a non-meat eater."
Jan 2020,30,DELAYS,We flew on vacation to Florida know United and both ways were delayed. The outgoing delay was due to a mechanical problem and the delay was an hour. The incoming delay was supposedly weather related although other NY airports were not experiencing 4 hour delays. The staff did their best to keep us up to date and gave everyone a $20 food voucher. We were supposed to land in Newark at 6:30 and instead we landed at close to 11pm.
Jan 2020,10,Christmas getaway,We will NEVER fly United again!! We had 3 travelers and the cabin service was ridiculous!! The fligh to Cabo offered a pack of pretzels or cookies but not both..we were hungry & flight was 4 hrs!! They had no food to purchase..On return trip same thing happened..my son asked for 2 packs of pretzels &attendant said NO!! We don’t have enough..again we asked to buy food..all gone except candy..how could they be sold out @7:30 am?? Worst flying experience EVER!!
Jan 2020,20,Been stuck at the airport for over 6 hours,First attempt they got the wrong plane to fly to San Francisco from Palm Spring departing instead 615am to 10am missing my connection to Vancouver  Second attempt after last min change to arrive Vancouver via LAX earlier have to got to maintenance for 3 hour period have rebook with Alaska airline worst experience  Should have listen to guts about booking with untied at least the gate personal where helpful in rebooking
Jan 2020,20,Unimpressed,"This is by far my least favorite airline. I paid alot of money for my ticket which is only in economy, which is fine these things happen. But not once, not twice, but three times have I been delayed for almost two hours, but they tell you it will only be like 30 minutes, then the time goes by and they add another 30 minutes and then another. Maintenance issues and such. But not even the reason I hate it. You cannot get your boarding pass if you have no carry on/check in, you have to wait until you're at the airport, and I had to buy a check in and wait in line for a tag and then wait in another line to drop your bag off. I prefer spirit over this because then at least you know what you're getting."
Jan 2020,20,United and Newark traveler's nightmare.,"We arranged Business Class travel with Holland America and for most of our return trip, got basic economy. Our flights out of Newark were delayed by 5+ hours - both to / from Fort Lauderdale / Halifax. This is consistent with two other times we had to travel United. We paid thousands of $$ for Business and when we asked for a refund of the difference between Economy Basic and Business Class....United only refunded us $237 Cdn per person! Outrageous. We have codes they gave us for some $50 off our next flights, however, we will never travel United again."
Jan 2020,10,Never recommend,"Very terrible experience.  I had a problem with check-in at the airport and found no crew to help me. The first flight was operated by Austrian Airlines who completely refused to help me. I found no customer service number for Unitedthat is working in Egypt. Long story short, I had to miss the flight and found no one at all who I could even talk to."
Jan 2020,10,The worst flight,The worst airlines ever there baggage fees are stupid I didn’t like the flight at all the worst won’t recommend it to anyone super bad
Jan 2020,10,Worst first class experience.,"I paid top dollar for a first class seat on an international overnight flight on United as I needed a good night's sleep and thought I was in the wrong cabin. The seats had no leg room, barely reclined at all, and had no leg lifts. They did not provide blankets and pillows, there was no inflight entertainmemt, and for the price of first class you still had to pay extra for wifi. And the food was terrible. On top of all that the flight attendants were indifferent and rude and talked loudly to each other for the entire flight complaining about their jobs and boyfriends. I've had better trips on a bus."
Jan 2020,10,Delays and more delays,Flying out of Denver sucks. I hate going through Denver to get from NV to MI. First of all the layover time is ridiculous and the delays happen alot with United. United is not the airline of my choice!
Jan 2020,30,okay business class flight but could use improvement,okay so so service on United's business class/polaris product. The seats and entertainment were fine but the food was so-so to good. Service could be more attentive
Jan 2020,30,Average but perhaps a bit too casual,"I've flown 4 times and this was this most casual flight of them all. The team did their jobs and that was about it. The one thing that has stuck with me is how the pilot communicated upcoming turbulence. The pilot actually said "" the control tower lied"" about the degree of turbulence that was in our path. I just really think that the pilot should have chose his words more carefully."
Jan 2020,40,Comfortable Flight,Nice comfortable long haul flight. The plane was clean and staff was very attentive. The seats could’ve been more comfortable.
Jan 2020,40,relaxed short flight,Santa Barbara is a small friendly airport. We were called to board 20minutes before the flight departure. The stewardess was friendly and helpful. Total flight time was 1hour 20minutes of which about 45minutes was actually in the air.  On landing we were quickly let off the plane but waited around 20minutes at baggage reclaim.
Jan 2020,40,Mar - UA1603 ORD to PHX A320 FC Seats 1E & F,"After a day of meetings at the Hilton ORD Airport hotel, then another in downtown Chicago, we were heading home to Phoenix on March, 01, on United flight UA1603, in Seats 1E & F (not our “regular seats,” but 2E & F were taken), in First Class on this AirBus A320 (#4253 - was scheduled for #4662, but was changed). Our departure gate also changed, and then changed again, starting with C30, then C21, before finally being set at C31. It was during this gate change, that the ship was swapped, and #4662 was dispatched to DEN. Fortunately, we had the great United App, so knew of all of these changes, before the Gate Agents did. It was also not bad, as the gates were not all that far apart, but it could have been a bit unnerving for folk, not monitoring the changes on the App.    All of these gates had the newish 2-Lane boarding scheme, which has now been implemented across all United hub airports, and most lesser airports, through which we have flown. This system has only two lines, marked initially Group 1 and 2. All other boarding groups are asked to remain seated. When Groups 1 & 2 have boarded, it becomes Groups 3 & 4, and then finally, Group 5 (Basic Economy) is boarded. Due to our status, we always board immediately after passengers with disabilities, so never get to see how well this system works, through the full boarding process. The Gate Agents like it, and it does free up a lot of real estate in the boarding area, plus folk get to remain seated, until their group numbers have been called - seems far less congested and organized. So far, I like this system, even with our boarding prior to Group 1.    We had started the afternoon at the United Club near C-15. Originally, we were to depart from C-20. The Club was quite full this day, but we found a spot, and took the time for some Champagne. The bartender recognized us from three recent visits to the club, and had the glasses ready for us! I almost felt that I was in a scene from the old “Cheers” TV show, where everybody knows your name.    We boarded only a few minutes late, and were in our seats with a glass of Prosecco, our jackets hanging behind Row 3, before the plane was half full. As has been typical for most of our most recent flights on UA, and especially out of ORD, this one was completely full, with eight people on the wait list. Also, with only 12 FC seats, no one made the upgrade list at the airport.    The first row of FC is against the bulkhead, and has somewhat limited foot space (more though, than on our inbound A319), compared to the rows behind it. One limitation of these Row 1 FC seats is that the overhead bin space is somewhat limited, due to safety equipment in the forward compartment, plus some of it taking up space in the next bin, as well. Then, there is, of course, no underseat storage, as one faces the bulkhead. The small magazine pockets did not interfere with the foot/knee room. Compared to the Row 1 seats in the AirBus A319, and then the Boeing 737-800/900, this A320 had more foot room. Why it provides more, than its “sister ship,” the A319 is a bit odd, but the A319 only has two rows in FC, while the A320 has 3, so maybe more spacing around that extra row? Also, a difference between United’s A319 vs A320 is that the safety equipment storage is in the port side (A & B) on the A320, while it is on the starboard side (E & F), on the A319. Note: with this 2-2 configuration in FC, the seats are designated A-B, then E-F, and there are no C, or D seats.    This A320, like all of United’s AirBus fleet, had the newish FC seats, which are very nice, with a marble-topped podium, with marble drink drawer. They also have copious pockets to hold items, but those must be stored elsewhere, for takeoff and landing. These seats recline a bit differently, in that the lower cushion slides forward, and the rear cushion to pivot, without intruding too much, into the space behind. The forward, and locked position has a bit too much recline built in, and I wish that they would go just a few degrees more forward.    This ship had the PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) which feeds content to one’s device, through the United App. The latest version must be present, or downloaded, before the doors are closed. The streaming PDE worked fine. This service is free. There was also WiFi available, for a fee, but neither of us used that. One nice feature of the A320 is that the tray tables in FC, have a holder for a tablet/phone. However, I find that this could be more centered, as viewing is at a slight, but noticeable angle.    We did not get the warm Mixed Nuts after takeoff on this flight, and no explanation was offered. We ordered the Chardonnay, which was the District 7, from Monterrey County. We had first encountered it on the inbound flight, so were pleased that it was also served on this flight. It has more body, than the previous UA white wines, including their Chardonnays have recently had.    The dinner was:  Moroccan Chicken over Couscous w/ Grilled Peppers - this dish was more tasty, than it looked  Thai-style Beef Salad over Udon Noodles - now here, the dish looked better, than it tasted, with rather tough, tasteless beef  Pecan Cheese Cake – I am not a dessert person, but of the three variations of United’s Cheesecake, this is the best of the lot    We had taken off into increasing clouds, and were quickly above them, into the gathering gloom of evening. We did not see any clear weather, until our final approach into PHX.    We arrived only a few minutes late, onto Runway 26, so had to circle back, and around Terminals 4 & 3, to get to our gate (Gate 8) at T2.    This was a very good flight (except for the lack of the Mixed Nuts), and less inspired meal. The crew was friendly and efficient, as had been both the Gate Agents at ORD, and the staff at the United Club."
Jan 2020,30,Remember when flying was fun?,"This was our first flight in a couple of years. It gets worse and worse. The seats suck and they charge for everything. We got the cheap seats, no extras. Lucky on the outbound leg, got the extra leg room.Made a big difference. I had a middle seat. Flight had no entertainment system. Not horrible as I had an iPad.  Returning we were in next to last row. I had a window and my wife the center (after we got them to put us together). Really cramped. So tight I couldn't get to the entertainment controls on the left arm rest. Both flights were on-time."
Jan 2020,40,OK Flight,Flight left on time arrived on time and the crew was friendly. Oh the flight was half empty made it really easy for the crew. Not a big deal flight.
Jan 2020,30,Basic means basic,"When you book your flight thru the cheaper booking sites you get what you pay for. I didn't think it was possible to be less class than economy,but apparently basic economy is even less. No carry on are permitted, you have to pay to select your seat, and then they delay the flights because of stupid reasons, like they forgot to tell a flight attendant to work, so we then have to wait. I think what blows my mind the most is that they have their own personnell flying on the plane...why can't those folks step up and get the flight out ontime."
Jan 2020,10,"Un-United Doesn't Let You Sit with Your Family Unless You Pay $1,000","United Airlines is extorting families for money just to be able to sit together on their flights. When I purchased tickets for an intl flight, I chose basic economy because the price for the upgrade on 3 seats was over $1300 more than the already expensive tickets. The basic economy said it doesn't include checked baggage and you can't choose your seats. I knew that I would be checking baggage, but I also knew that checking baggage doesn't cost anywhere near $1300, so I didn't choose that option. Then, when I check in the day before the flight, I realized that not choosing your seats, also meant that they won't sit you with your family. I don't care where I sit, but I do want to sit with my family. Our daughter is handicapped and a minor, so I was shocked when they thought it would be OK for a minor to not sit with her parents on a flight. Luckily, they did change the seats so that one of us could sit with her, but not both. Not only is United's seating policy unclear, it is completely ridiculous to think that families and loved ones flying together have to pay such ridiculously high fees just to sit together. We weren't the only ones. On every flight, families are asking others to change seats and playing musical chairs with luggage and everything. All 4 legs of our flights were delayed for take off because everyone was not in their seats on time, even though they had boarded the planes."
Jan 2020,20,Go with Alaska,"My family of six took a cruise to Mexico. Our airfare was included and booked many months in advance. When we checked in at SanDiego airport on our way home, only 3 of us had assigned seats. The other three were told that the gate attendant would try to find them something. WTF? They have had months to “find” us seats! Very disappointed. United airlines clearly doesn’t give a damn about their customers. I usually fly Alaska and have never experienced this with them. United can count on not seeing my business again. :("
Jan 2020,40,Feb - UA248 PHX to ORD A319 FC Seats 1A & B,"On February 26, we flew to Chicago, from Phoenix (PHX) for a series of meetings for my wife. We flew First Class on UA248 on an AirBus A319 (#4888) in Seats 1A & B. Those are not our favorite seats, but this trip was added at the last minute, and we had to take what was available.    We departed from Gate 3 in PHX T2, and arrived 10 mins early at Gate C25 at ORD. Our luggage came out onto Carousel 5.    We started our morning at the little United Club, at the other end of T2 from our gate, but still a short walk. The Champagne was a good way to begin a day of travel.    This flight was almost completely filled (one seat in E+, and one at the back of E), with maybe 8 people on the stand-by list. No one from the First Class wait list got an upgrade, that I could tell..    Gate 3 at PHX T2 has probably the largest gate area of any single gate in T2. The area of 6A & B, plus 8 is about as large, but that is for three gates on the west side of the concourse. The United crew at PHX has a habit of decorating several of the gates, and the UA Club, for all sorts of holidays and events. As this was in February, I found it odd that Gate 3 had a tribute to Major League Baseball, but did not get to ask why. Because of its size, and the layout of its podium area, Gate 3 sees some of the larger displays.    We started with a glass of Spumante for our pre-departure beverage. We were soon on our way, on a very hazy Winter’s morning, with storms between us, and ORD..    We started the in-flight meal service with Chardonnay (District 7 Monterrey County Chardonnay, which was new to us, and rather good) and warmed, mixed nuts. This 3:19 min flight featured a lunch, as we departed after 10:00am, with a choice of Thai Chicken Salad, or Chicken Tandori w/ Basmati Rice w/ Tofu and a salad. Both came with a slice of Lemon Cheesecake (not my favorite, but then I am not a “dessert person”). We each got the “United Pretzel Bread” roll, which is always good. We had experienced these dishes before, so knew what to expect, and chose one each. The Chicken Tandori, while a bit dry, was the better option. I always find UA’s “Thai” anything, a bit too sweet for my tastes.    I moved from the District 7 Chardonnay, to the Fortrant Cabernet Sauvignon. As my wife had meetings upon arrival, she went with just coffee.    Some years back, United refurbished their AirBus ships, both the A319's and A320's. They changed out the seats in First Class, to feature a granite-topped center console, with pull-out granite tray, and seats which recline by allowing the lower cushion to slide forward, and the rear cushion to recline, but with very little intrusion into the area of the seat behind. The recline is a bit tricky, the first time that one encounters it, but once they pick up on the motion - slide your bottom forward - it’s very easy and nice - especially on the folk behind you. Now, we are not big fans of Row 1 seats on any of UA’s domestic planes, and the A319 is no exception. Because it is fronting the partition, footroom is slightly diminished, though knee room is still very good. Next, there is no underseat storage, and while adequate in size, there is a limitation in the overhead bins, though that is mainly on the starboard side, so Row 1, Seats E & F, as there is safety equipment stored in the small forward bin, and in part of the larger bin. With no underseat storage, I had to place my briefcase, my wife’s small rolling briefcase and her purse (for takeoff and landing), in the overhead bin, but on the port side, we had a full bin, with no safety equipment. Also, in the FC cabin, each seat has several pockets, which can be used for tablets, etc, but not during takeoff or landing. Also, the “seatback pocket” is attached to the bulkhead, but does not really project into the knee room area - but mind it, when entering your row. The window to seat relationship is just a bit off in Row 1, as well, and since these FC seats have more recline built into them, looking out of the window from the A, or F seats, is not a simple matter of turning one’s head - just very slightly awkward.    We departed PHX on Runway 25L, in a fairly dense haze, and then had clouds for most of the flight, though we did have a few light spots, over the Rockies. Normally, we get good views of the Painted Desert, Meteor Crater, the Four Corners Area and the Rocky Mountains, but not much on this flight - though I did get to see a bit of snow, around Colorado/New Mexico.    We managed to skirt most of the weather into ORD, but visibility was rather low, so not much to see.    Our Gate Agents at PHX were great (first time, in quite a while, that we did not know any of them), as was the entire cabin crew. Our luggage arrived quickly, and we were off to the Hilton ORD hotel, attached via an underground walkway."
Jan 2020,10,United care of its passengers is shameful,"I have been a loyal United client for years. I have had their credit card for years. I stayed loyal to United even after the many horrible customer service disasters they have had in the past few years. But with my last experience with this airlines and their crew both in the flight and on ground in Toronto left me aghast and so disappointed that I am breaking my relationship with them, cancelling my United Club credit card and withholding my business from them.  We were on our way to Delhi, India from Wash DC via Toronto. Due to bad weather in Toronto, the flight was diverted to Syracuse for a short time and by the time we reached Toronto, the connecting flight had already left. Ok, I understand. But what was shocking was the airlines staff treated us. We asked for guidance from the flight crew as to what do we do when we get to the terminal -they just shook their head and shrugged ""we don't know."" Ok may be too much to ask. But even after we landed, there was no one anywhere in the terminal to attend to us or guide us or tell us the next step. Toronto Pearson airport is huge and close to midnight we, two old people, had to walk here and there, up and down just to find someone from United to whom we could ask questions. We kept going and asking every open counter of any airlines that was still working and finally one kind worker announced asking for a United rep and also made a few phone calls. Finally someone showed up around 1am. She booked us on a flight for the next night at 8.30pm and gave us vouchers for Holiday Inn and meals that could only be had at participating airport restaurants. All were closed so we could not eat anything. Our baggage could not be traced so she said come the next day and look in lost and found. Eager to lay down after 12 hours of struggle, we trudged to the shuttle area and waited for Holiday Inn shuttles. One by one they came, we showed the vouchers, they said ""oh this is not us"" and left. 1.30am now. We decided to just get into the next shuttle of the Holiday Inn that the last driver said we should go to. We reached at 2am. They refused to accept the voucher. THERE WAS NO ADDRESS OF THE HOTEL WRITTEN ON THE VOUCHER--which is the normal practice I am told. There are 4 Holiday Inns near that airport- with no address written none had to accept us. I spoke to United 1-800 number while begging the Holiday Inn desk clerk to take us in. The CS rep on the phone was considerate and was surprised to hear that no address was written on the voucher nor did that employee at the airport called and let the hotel know that two passengers are headed that way. But she could not do anything for us. I hung up. 2am now. Freezing cold of Toronto with 30mph winds. and we are out on the pavement-two old people, Business class passengers of United Airlines. At the end of our wits, tired, hungry, irate, we saw Westin hotel across the road and we pulled n pushed ourselves there and paid for a room. What a difference! (Read my review of Westin Toronto) The kind and caring staff received us warmly, took care of us by upgrading our room, throwing in complimentary breakfast, giving us some snacks that we could eat before sleeping since the kitchen was closed. They saved us that night. I have now received a $300 coupon from United to make up for our horrendous night. I do not accept it and want a better response. Please be warned and beware of their customer service."
Jan 2020,30,"Knocked Around, Bags and Flight Arrived on Time.","Good News: Checked 2 pieces of luggage for International travel to Costa Rica and it arrived as expected.    The only issue I ever have traveling is that there is no respect by travelers or airlines for those needing to make a connecting flight. There is no way for travelers to control or know how much time is needed when flights move gates or are delayed making the connection even more challenging. Most of the time we are not familiar with the airports either.    Lastly, I find the United service crew crabby. One of the United crew members hit me in the head when closing the storage bins and did not even realize she had done so. One other walked right into my arm as I was trying to get my back pack from under my seat. Neither acknowledged that they knocked me and made no apology."
Jan 2020,50,Excellent flight,"Flight timing was excellent. Crew were professional, courteous, helpful, friendly. The trip was a non stop flight. I had time to crochet and read. Very enjoyable. Appreciate everyone who had a part in our trip."
Jan 2020,10,I wish I could give 0,"I was shipping an animal through petsafe cargo, I arrived at 6:20 am to have my puppy on a flight leaving at 8:14 am. the employee had no other people in the waiting area, had no other items behind or around to be shipped and was sitting doing nothing. I walked in and was told that I could not ship my puppy becuase I was there under 2 hours before my flight. I have checked every thing online and in my correspondence and nothing says you cannot ship if you are later than 2 hours before, it is suggested and helpful but nothing says you are barred if you arrive 1:59:59 before your flight time. I understand that sometimes there are issues and sometimes when busy, flight delayed or other circumstances as customer s we are supposed to be patient, but UNITED PETSAFE is not, the are not patient, they do not care and only care that they do as little as possible and have no concern with customer service, so find anohter carrier I have and stay as far away from United as humanly possible. I will never fly with them nor ship with them again and I suggest you do the same and maybe if they lose enough business they will remember what customer service is."
Jan 2020,50,Great Flights,"Everything was on time. The premium lounges in Chicago are outstanding. Plane service was great. Food was pretty good. Seating on plane was comfortable and as expected, (older plane).  We enjoy the newer larger planes as everything is better, but it was still a great flight. Out return flight was 45 minutes early to Chicago, and we were able to get to a gate quickly. Usually you have wait.  We will fly this airline again."
Jan 2020,50,Premium Economy is Better Value than Business.,"We usually fly a Japanese airlines when returning to Okinawa but this time UA had best fare. I had looked up the new Premium Plus and was hoping this is what we had. We passed thru Business class and usually wish we upgraded but this time when we got to our seats we were thrilled. They are similar to first class domestic seats in size and we had a large screen private tv with a lot of great movies, our own charging station, plenty of room to stretch out and not feel cramped. The food was good, not fantastic but much better than AA, they also offer free alcoholic drinks as well as several snacks and full meals. I wasn’t looking forward to 14 hours in the air but now it’s a breeze compared to other airlines. The blanket and pillow is Saks so very soft and comfy. They did give an amenity kit but no house shoes, I would recommend this upgrade with the only negative being it doesn’t include access to the lounge prior to flights."
Jan 2020,10,Change gate,They change gates with no warning  They should just put not available if they don't know the gate instead they put one on the board and change it later
Jan 2020,40,Good economy flight...,"As a veteran, I have always tried to use United Airlines. They were so supportive of us during my time of service so I’m a bit partial and really never “shop around”. I don’t travel by air frequently.  This is the first trip I’ve ever taken United that I wasn’t offered a free upgrade due to my prior service so I guess I’m doing pretty good!  In general, United Airlines has great service with a very friendly staff."
Jan 2020,50,Best airline ever,I travel a lot usually on united airlines in my opinion it is the best airline in the world because it has a lot of space and can be very comfortable in business class for long flights. If you are going on any flight I definitely recommend United every single time because it is the best airline ever. No airline can beat it.
Jan 2020,50,EWR United was excellent,"The United staff at EWR went above and beyond to accommodate my family and I when I was unable to fly. I attempted to board the flight and almost passed out. Without hesitation, they put us on a flight the next day, gave us hotel accommodations, and meal vouchers. Will definitely recommend this airline to anyone and am strongly considering becoming a United member. Thanks again EWR team!!"
Jan 2020,40,Great value airline,"I had read a few reviews about UA and arrived at the airport ready for a return flight from Australia to the USA with few expectations. I even packed my own snacks as I anticipated being served some insipid and inadequate fare. I was aware that the Economy seats didn't recline more than a few degrees but I also expected them to be cramped. As it turned out, United was excellent value. The food was great and in plentiful supply. The seats were spacious and even though I couldn't recline far back, it was very comfortable for my 180 cm frame. The entertainment options were equally impressive. The plane was clean and the flight crew were very courteous. I have absolutely no complaints about UA and would be more than happy to fly with them again. I just wish the seats went back further but that may be a feature of all modern jets now. Highly recommended."
Jan 2020,40,"Good, professional airline","Great flight, very average legroom, but good in-flight movies. The staff was very kind and attentive through a turbulent flight."
Jan 2020,20,Be Careful,"Be careful when booking through travel sites - our economy tickets turned out to be ""Basic"" economy which does not allow carry-on bags. We learned this while checking in for flight 24 hours prior. United website states that international travel across an ocean is excluded from this policy, but United excludes Mexico from this policy (learned this from customer service). Then, after repacking carry-on bags into 1 checked bag the night before departure, our 1 checked bag somehow got sent to a different airport and did not make it to our destination until 24 hours after our arrival. Not a way to start a vacation..."
Jan 2020,30,Except for some nice people we would have missed our connecting flight,"We were headed to the airport when we found out our flight to Houston had been delayed. Twice. We got to the airport and went to check in and I told the ticketing agent that we would miss our connection and she found us the last 2 seats on a plane that was already boarding. From there another agent took us through security and got us to the plane in time to board. We were extremely grateful to these two people.  The planes seats remain too small and less than comfortable, but we put that aside this flight and were just happy to be aboard."
Jan 2020,30,No legroom,In economy there is no comfort. The seat were uncomfortable as the legroom was just about nonexistent. If I ever have to take another flight in the US and I can have Hawaiian Airlines as a choice I will!!!
Jan 2020,40,Great Flight,"Flight was good, and good thng I'm short & small because the 777 plane is a tight fit. But in-flight service was nice"
Jan 2020,50,Fantastic experience,"Flying to Denver from Mammoth Yosemite Airport is a dream. Because we live in a remote area, we parked at the airport, but if you live in Mammoth Lakes, you can take a shuttle or Uber/Lyft/Taxi or ask a friend. The parking is $8 a night, which you pay for by check or CC that you put in a box near the terminal (similar to paying for a camping spot). There is a little cafe to get food and charge up. It wasn't crowded. When your flight is getting close, they announce that the security is now open. I was surprised at the number of people who had items to be confiscated in their bags. Are these things missed when they fly out?    You walk out on the runway to board the plane. There is basically no overhead space, so they make you check your large overhead bag at the door (no charge) and then in Denver, they bring it right to the plane so you can pick it up.    The crew was friendly and helpful. There was more than enough staff for the number of passengers. We sat a while on the runway, as it is a small airport and we had to wait until a private plane landed before taking off.    The day we flew was clear and calm. No bumps whatsoever and the views the entire way were spectacular. The cabin was not full, so we both took window seats. Arrival at Denver was early (the filight is 1h40mins long). You park at a remote gate. We had a layover until our next flight, so we ate at Elways in the terminal.    The only aggravating part was on the return, our car was iced over and covered with about 8 inches of snow. So we had to work a bit to get it cleared before we could drive off. But that's winter in Mammoth and we were prepared with shovels and scrapers."
Jan 2020,50,Slept for the first time on an overnight flight,Love the new polaris seats. The 1-1-1 window seat felt so private. Very comfortable. Entertainment was fine as was the food but the seat is worth every penny to fly upfront.
Jan 2020,40,Nice Return Home Flight from Hawaii,"Even though this was a long (about ten hour) flight, it was quite relaxing. Our seats were comfortable. There were plenty of video and audio entertainment options. The regular lunch and breakfast meals were just OK, but my wife ordered the vegetarian meals and she said her meals were excellent. The flight crew members were friendly and attentive. Boarding the plane at HNL was quick and efficient because the first class customers boarded using the door near the front of the plane while the coach class customers boarded using the door behind the first class section."
Jan 2020,40,Great Flight,"Even though this was a long (nearly eleven hour) flight, it was quite enjoyable. Our seats were comfortable. There were plenty of video and audio entertainment options. The regular breakfast meal was just OK, but my wife ordered the vegetarian breakfast meal and she said it was excellent. The flight crew members were friendly and attentive. Although we departed about fifteen minutes late, we arrived ahead of schedule."
Jan 2020,10,I'd give them 0's if I could.,"On the way down: ""Yep - 4 free checked bags.""    On the way back: ""Nope - only two.""    I've *had it with this airline.    #laststraw"
Jan 2020,30,Disappointing experiences for this long-time customer,"There were too many disappointing experiences on a flight from Chicago to Paris not to post a review.    1) The flight was unusually uncomfortable. Overseas flights on United have generally been more comfortable than domestic flights, particularly in Economy Plus. While there was more legroom, the seats on a Boeing 767-300 that seemed to be new were narrower, harder, and did not recline sufficiently. The seats were so uncomfortable that I will seriously consider flying another airline on future overseas trips because I want to be able to sleep on an overnight flight. In my opinion, UAL needs to make customer comfort a higher priority, and this includes the width of the aisles. I dislike needing to navigate around people's legs, arms, etc. that are in the aisles on the way to/from the lavatory.  .  2) The level of service has diminished. This overnight flight did not serve breakfast as promoted at the beginning of the flight, and which all overnight flights have provided in the past. Separately, several members of the crew did not know how to turn the individual reading lights. This appears to be another example of poor training. Additionally, the lights are not properly aimed for reading and were too dim.    3) Commitment to sustainable practices waning. I was disappointed to see UAL serving water in individual plastic bottles."
Jan 2020,30,Good experience,"Over all was a good flight. Given the fact we didn't have internet connection for the last 1/3 of the flight was not good. movies stopped unfinished because of that. Also, now a days everything is for extra fee, luggage, Carry on, food. I wish the same way air line companies remove items to be included when economy is not good, they bring those options back when they are back on making money.  One other issue, I wanted to upgrade my seat to Economy plus before my flight for $45 for each seat and due to some internet problem, the payment didn't go through and when I got to airport to buy the same seats the price went up to $85 each. I was shocked."
Jan 2020,10,poor airline,"United was probably the worst of all our flights,,, no meals as they were sold out and the seats were so crammed."
Jan 2020,50,Good Airline to fly in domestic paet,Flew Newyork-Chicago/ Chicago-Dallas/ Dallas-San Francisco/ San Francisco-Portland  4 places flight was in time. Good service.good airline crew.neat and clean. Prompt service.
Jan 2020,20,misleading information from Mileage Plus representative,"I enrolled in United's Mileage Plus program to get free baggage check-in in the economy class. The customer service representative to whom I spoke on the phone told me the baggage check would be free. When I arrived at the airport, I had to pay for checked bags despite my membership in Mileage Plus. I would not recommend flying with this airline."
Jan 2020,10,"Rude staff, poor experience","United never disappoint when come to bad service. I tried it internationally and in South East Asia it wasn't the worst, but to Europe, their service match other bad airlines.    Lack of option in food, staff are awful on the airplane and on the ground. I had to use them, would never fly on their airlines while i stand another option .    The flight attendance was so rude to me not sure what was her problem"
Jan 2020,10,The dont care about babys safty,We flew with united airlines for Christmas and we checked bags and carseats for our 1 year old. The broke her headrest and they are saying that its normal wearer and tear she had the carseat for 6 month. I feel that united airlines dont care about there customers safty let alone a baby. This just really opened my eyes the way they treat there customers I will NEVER fly with them again.
Jan 2020,10,Called “aggressive” when asked to soaring to a manager,"I’ve been flying for over 25 years and have never had any issues on United or any other airline as far as customer service. Lovely trip from SFO to PDX but when a customer service agent rudely told me to “read the fine print” and lambasted their own ticketing agents and service center reps for giving us misinformation, I asked for a manager. Then I was told I was being “aggressive” and they wanted the name of the person that said we might be able to get an isle seat and insinuated I was making up the fact they had pulled up available seats saying it wouldn’t be a problem. I will never fly into PDX on United again -"
Jan 2020,40,Good Flight,"We flew Polaris (Business) Class between San Francisco and Frankfurt, Germany, on a Boeing 777-300 ER. Both boarding and disembarking went smoothly. The flight attendants proved to be exceptionally professional and gracious, which I have not found to be typical on United flights. Food, however, remained at the barely average level and I ate only a little throughout the 11-hour flight.    My husband and I had the two middle seats in a 2 x 2 x 2 configuration. We always try to get these seats because both of us have immediate access to an aisle without having to crawl over each other. The seats proved to be comfortable and reclined completely with blankets, pillows and slippers provided by the airline. Audio-visual equipment and lighting worked well. Toilet areas were kept fairly clean and the cabin was clean.    The plane encountered little turbulence, so it was possible to get much sleep. The captain kept us updated and flight attendants checked periodically to determine if passengers needed anything. Arrival was on time."
Jan 2020,50,Friendly and generous,I’ve only had one bad experience with United. My flight into Houston was delayed which caused me to miss my connection which would have brought me back home. I had to stay the night at a hotel. I was quite frustrated but the customer service agent with United was very friendly. She was doing everything she could to help and she was quite a pleasure to work with. I was irritated but it was refreshing to deal with someone like her.    Even though United was unable to refund the hotel stay (the delay wasn’t really their fault) they were very nice and gave me a $100 gift certificate for my next flight. They didn’t have to do that and I really appreciated it. Thanks again! Such a generous move.
Jan 2020,20,A Delayed Departure with Poor Customer Service,"Overall the flight was fine, there were some minor annoyances with respect to the movies resetting constantly. We had a connection to meet on our return trip that we missed due to a delay on the first plane back. After a very long line to find out what our other options were, we were eventually given a new flight to return home on, having to wait in the airport for 3 hours."
Jan 2020,50,Excellent UA Fiendly Skies Trip,"Excellent check-in, quickly through security, safe and entertaining flight, bags ready upon arrival at baggage claim. Cannot get much better than that."
Jan 2020,30,And another crappy flight,"I have only good things to say about the staff and crews I met during this trip, the airline, well not so much. When making my connection, I discovered the flight was delayed by over 3 hours. While that was bad enough, our gate was changed no less than 3 times, requiring us to run from one long distance terminal to another . One would have hoped that United would have offered a drink voucher or a glass of wine or some sort of small compensation to make things a bit better. One would have been wrong. Yet again United missed the mark."
Jan 2020,30,Poor customer service,"I experienced sub-par customer service when flying United. I was on a flight that was supposed to land in Redmond. Due to fog, we got redirected to Eugene, then Portland. The pilot and flight attendant were wonderful, keeping us informed every step of the way. However, we were delayed because we took a different flights extra bags on our small plane. If we did not have to wait for all the bags, we would have been able to beat the fog. When we were redirected to Portland after trying to land in Redmond for the second time, we were greeted by some not so friendly gate attendants that were not prepared for our questions/situation. We got off the plane with no information as to how to get back to Redmond. The attendants did not put us at ease or provide our options. They were yelling at us saying they would ""deal"" with us one at a time. They seemed very frustrated at us, when we were frantic about how to get home after a 24hr day of travel. Some of the customers were already stuck in Denver overnight. We were exhausted and just wanted to know our options. After finally getting a refund they would not allow me to put it on a different card then booking. Not sure why this was not an option. However, I do appreciate the refund and friendly staff on the plane. Would like to see better communication within staff members in the future."
Jan 2020,50,Very Comfortable Flight,"As always service was excellent. I have never been disappointed with United Airlines service and quality. They offer non-stop service to a wide variety of destinations, making United Airline my airline of choice."
Jan 2020,30,Flight Fine / Customer Service Lacking,"We flew roundtrip on United from Los Angeles to Los Cabos and the flights were fine -- rather uneventful. The planes were reasonably on time and the flight crew while not overly solicitous were certainly available and pleasant. The available snacks were limited, but for a short flight this did not present a problem.    My concerns with United are these:    1) At LA's International Airport, there are specific terminals for airlines but also an international terminal. Since I wasn't positive which terminal United's international flight would use, I reached out to Customer Service with my question. I was specifically told that the flight would originate from the Tom Bradley International Terminal -- information that proved to be wrong (resulting in my being dropped off at one terminal and having to walk, with luggage, a considerable distance. This is absolutely inexcusable.    2) Prior to flying, and based on information provided on United's website for flights to Mexico, we completed Customs and Immigration paperwork. The instructions were to complete these on-line and print them out for presentation upon arrival in Los Cabos. The instructions noted that this would be a time-saver. Because of this, we did not take the forms that were handed out on-board the flight. Upon arrival, and after finally making it to the front of the line, we were informed by the Mexican authorities that the forms were not acceptable and we needed to complete new ones (they were essentially the same but had a tear-off for us upon departing Mexico). This resulted in our losing our place in line, filling out the forms, and then returning to the line. If United's on-line information accurate, we would have saved, easily, 30 minutes.    In fairness, when this was brought to United's attention after we returned from our trip, they did offer a small financial coupon for a future flight. They did not, however, seem particularly concerned and made no mention of clarifying information with their Customer Service staff or amending their on-line information about paperwork for entering Mexico.    This issue won't result in my boycotting United, but it will make me be particularly careful when clarifying information about a flight."
Jan 2020,40,Inconvenience Made Right,"I've flown United many times in the past, and have never had any real problems with them, other than the occasional change in flight time.  A few days ago, we were coming home from a great trip to Puerto Vallarta. We were to fly from Puerto Vallarta to Denver, where we would take our connecting flight to Detroit. Well according to the pilot, because of some changes in the configuration of the runways, we left Puerto Vallarta almost 2 hours late. By the time we got to Denver, went through customs and immigration, we had missed our connecting flight to Detroit and the earliest one we could get on was the next morning at 11:00 AM. We were not happy! I had pictures of us spending the night sleeping in the airport and all I wanted to do was get home. Well we went up to customer service, and they were just awesome. She got us food vouchers, shuttle vouchers, and put us up in the Sheraton over night,..not some cheap place, but a beautiful hotel. It was GREAT! It was unfortunate that we couldn't have gotten home Saturday like we were hoping to, but thanks to this kind lady at customer service (I wish I had her name) it made an unfortunate delay much more bearable/pleasant :-)"
Jan 2020,10,Aspiring to be as bad as Spirit Airlines,"Worst crew of servers ever. Gross, incompetent, and frankly ridiculous. I have heard incoherent arguments before, but these folks belong in some drunken chicken wings type of joint, not serving in the sky. The antagonistic nature of the worst offender--a very large, white female stewardess with zero customer service skills--made the experience absurd. Avoid United. I used to think Spirit was the worst US-based offender, but United's crew of ladies who'd do well in a soccer moms' fight has clearly bumped Spirit to second worst."
Jan 2020,20,"Old aircraft, sub par service for an Economy Plus flight","This was a Lufthansa flight operated by UA. Originally, as an Economy ticket, my assumption is that I was upgraded to Premium Economy because Lufthansa Economy is much superior than the UA Economy class (i.e. Lufthansa serves free alcohol in Economy and UA doesn't).    Regardless of that, UA Premium Aeconomy class is terrible. The aircraft was decrepit, the infotainment system's screen was probably the size of an iPhone+ and the resolution much worse. The fabric in of the seats worn out and the quality of the food just really poor. Everything was wrapped in cellophane, plastic flatware included. You would think that there would be a little more attention for the environment, but the reality is that profit is the only drive, reducing expenses to the bone with no regard for the customers' experience.    The biggest issue is that American air transportation as a whole is become so bad and greedy that there is no real better alternative."
Jan 2020,50,Wish the flight lasted more than 12 hours it was so great!,My daughter has United Premier 1K status and convinced me to purchase seats so we could use her upgrade to business class (versus redeeming mileage points for the flight.) WOW! What a difference! The food was awesome! The wine and complimentary cocktails were so much better than in back of the plane. The bed made us feel fully rested and ready fir the next day! Only downside was that I had a rude/grumpy flight attendant (Robert). But since we sat together her delightful flight attendant Layth took care of both of us.  Well worth the money to arrive in SFO fully rested and ready to explore. This flight gave us “an extra day” of vacation and the flight was so much fun we didn’t want it to end!
Jan 2020,50,Excellent Flight!,"The attendants were extremely helpful and pleasant. They were up and down the aisle regularly to see if anyone needed anything. The departure was on time, as was the return. I will definitely fly with United again."
Jan 2020,30,Boarding team were rude in newark airport,"We Fly to different country , took united as we went on package trip with Expedia.  checking was good, flights were on time. Staff scanning tickets to board flight they don,t know how to greet people.there faces were blank and rude to people .they were discriminating when few people entered with wrong group , they allowed few in and thrown out of line few people .There were impolite in answering questions.On board crew was better in serving but lack of greeting people .we experienced best from other international flights.they knew how to greet and treat people , i feel they were committed to work.  United flight attendants and boarding crew look like they just wanted to finish their hours of work.I am not sure they are understaffed . i also saw one girl locked in bathroom before take off . They locked bathroom without checking who was in bath room.one of passengers who knows how to open fro outside he opened it for her. girl was terrified in plane."
Jan 2020,50,Crew handled everything from first class service to medical emergency,This United crew was well prepared. Having upgraded my wife and I were in different rows. Thanks to crew members and friendly fliers we were able to rearrange things and sit together. The plane boarded normally and First class service was first rate. Soon into the flight a medical emergency arose. I was impressed with the actions of the crew to aid the distressed passenger. For some time I thought we may be rerouted but the crew did an excellent job keeping everyone calm and comfortable. On top of that we left on time and arrived early. Thanks United.
Jan 2020,10,Flying United,"After first flight being delayed over 3 hours to go to Vancouver. We were waiting for return flight at time of supposedly boarding time, there was no plane & no updates. We finally got on board after nearly 50 minute delay. While taxiing to runway we stopped & had to go back to get to let someone off. There was a lady sitting in the cockpit at the start of this, this was the person who had to get off. They tried to tell us she was a pilot but no uniform which a pilot on duty would wear. Not sure if she was the captain’s girl friend or not but it delayed us another hour. Two flights with United both delayed wish I flew with another carrier."
Jan 2020,20,The worst business class in the world!,"Evedrything is on the cheap side... which airlines serve ""la vache qui rit' as the cheese course in a business class? No fresh fruit...  Food is terrible. Drinks also (wines)  ...and this was not a cheap or short flight! it takes almost 5 hours...  Avoid United! Alas it is the only non stop flight from NY to and from Bonaire...so that is why they treat you so poorly!"
Jan 2020,30,on time flights,I appreciated the fact that our flights were on time.... one flight was late almost an hour but we ended up getting to kona on time so that was great.    Flight from Kona was so crowded and the seats were really bad (last row)...Staff won't help with changing seats at all.
Jan 2020,10,Terrible Experience with Delayed Baggage,"TL:DR – United has some of the worst customer service when it comes to delayed bags on international flights. Their conduct in my experience was incompetent, unprofessional, and untrustworthy. I have significant doubts as to whether I will ever fly with them again.    I flew on United Airlines in December of 2019 to get from Chicago O’Hare to Rio de Janeiro, Santos Dumont Airport, Brazil. This was the first leg of a multi-stop trip through Latin America, which was to include 4 days hiking and camping around Patagonia in Argentina/Chile. Upon arrival to Sao Paulo Guarulhos (GRU) for my connection to Rio, I find out that one of my checked bags (a backpack containing all my hiking equipment) had never left Chicago O’Hare. Patagonia can get down to 30 degrees Fahrenheit and can have very rainy weather in December, so the fact that I was missing all my cold weather gear and my wet weather items (retailed at over $1000, if including the bag) was a big deal.    Going to the United Baggage desk in GRU, the attendant apologized for the issue and said it would be delivered to my AirBnb location in Rio the following day. This was a clutch statement: it was the morning of December 15th and I would be flying out to Buenos Aires, Argentina on December 17th. If the bag DID NOT arrive on the 16th, I wouldn’t be able to get it. I was hesitant, but the attendant assured me with “99% certainty” that the bag would arrive to my AirBnb location by the next evening so I agreed.    Flash forward and it is 11:30pm on the 16th, and my bag had not arrived. I tried calling the international baggage help desk, but the attendant on the line could only tell me that the bag was “out for delivery” and he was unable to get a hold of a United rep in Brazil and/or the delivery company, so there was nothing he could do to confirm. I wake up at 8am on the 17th, getting ready to leave the AirBnb and head to Argentina, and still no clue on the whereabouts of my bag. I check into my flight at the Santos Dumont Airport, and try calling United again. They still can’t get a hold of anyone in Brazil (by this point it is around 10am, well into regular business hours). When I tell them that I am at the Santos Dumont Airport (SDU) in Rio, they tell me to swing by the United bag desk in Terminal 3. I walk around trying to find it, and realize there are only 2 terminals at SDU. I tell them there is no such place and the guy on the line insists there is one. Based on what he says, I realize that the guy on the phone is talking about Guarulhos airport in Sao Paulo, and doesn’t realize that I am in Rio de Janeiro, despite telling me just 10 minutes earlier that the bag was out for delivery in Rio. I give up and end the call, since I am not interested in giving a geography lesson.    My flight from Rio to Buenos Aires included a layover in Sao Paulo Guarulhos, so I use the opportunity to go to the United Baggage desk in Terminal 3 and speak with an attendant in person. They explain that the bag took longer than expected to get through customs, hence why it wasn’t delivered on the 16th. I ask to begin the process of making a claim since I will have to go buy replacement equipment, but the rep tells me that they can route the bag to my next destination. I explain that I was going to be moving around quite a bit the next few days, staying the night of the 17th in Buenos Aires before moving to El Calafate on the 18th, and departing on a 4 day trek/hike early morning on the 20th. The rep assures me that they can get the bag delivered to El Calafate by the morning of the 19th, and asks that I give them one more shot to make this right. I was again hesitant given their poor track record, but I don’t have much of a choice. If I went ahead and bought replacement items (~$800) and the bag makes it to El Calafate, I wouldn’t be able to claim those expenses. Reluctantly, I agree.    Fast forward to the 19th. I get an email from the Guarulhos desk that the bag should be delivered to the El Calafate airport by noon, through a different airline company. I get to the airport in the late afternoon and ask if they have a bag for me, and they do not. They take me into the room where they keep all extra/unclaimed bags, and clearly mine is not in there. At this point, I only have about 4 hours before all the shops in El Calafate shut down, and I was to depart to Chile at 4am the next day. I call the international United baggage assistance line and am appalled at the response I am given. The guy on the line tries to call the partner airline to verify that my bag never made it, but can’t reach them and can’t take my word for it even though I tell them I was just at the airport. Basically, the conversation could be summed up with the following points: a) United had no idea where my bag was at this point, as they couldn’t tell me if it was in Rio, Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, or god knows where, b) they wouldn’t be able to assure me that I would be compensated for interim expenses until a supervisor could verify that the bag didn’t make it to El Calafate (which would occur… who knows when), c) they expected me to try and find “rental options” for the supplies I needed in order to save on costs (this would’ve been feasible if I had more than a couple of hours to make purchases), and d) they suddenly wanted me to offer a line-by-line list of every item that was in the bag, down to color of the item and brand. The call rep actually asked me for the line-by-line list after I had reminded them for the umpteenth time that I had limited time for the phone call, since local shops would be closing in a few hours, and I didn’t have the equipment to be surviving in 30 degree weather. I couldn’t help shake the feeling that throughout the call, I was being treated as if I was someone who was trying to use the opportunity to scam United by trying to buy new equipment that would be worth more than my original items. The entire call took 2 hours, further reducing the time I had available to buy replacement items.    The only reason why I was in this predicament was because I had given United multiple opportunities, as they had requested, to right this problem. The sad thing is that it all started with United leaving my bag in Chicago, even though I had checked the bag in 3 hours prior to departure! I literally followed everything that they asked me to do, and the end result was me having to make rushed purchases on the local market, being out of pocket ~$700 USD for these purchases, no assurances given that I would be adequately compensated, being told that if I receive any compensation it would take 6-8 weeks to process, and no clue where my bag was (thus turning my delayed bag into lost baggage). This isn’t even getting into the fact that there were sentimental items in this bag that I wanted to carry with me in Patagonia (and through Latin America), such as a hand-sewn American flag and a tshirt for my friend’s business that I wanted to take pictures with for brand advertisement purposes. I’m also not going into the anxiety and frustration I had for the entire first week of my trip, sweating over whether I was going to get this bag on time or if I would need to go out of pocket on hundreds of dollars for replacements. Not to mention that all my calls had to be done on international roaming, so it racked up $50+ USD in phone bills.    At no point was any offer made to try and “right” these “inconveniences” with some kind of additional compensation. They only thing that United is willing to pay is the actual material costs of my expenses, nothing more. I finally just asked United to send my bag back to Chicago instead of having it ferried around all throughout Latin America, and this they actually succeeded in doing (slow clap for them… I guess).  To say I am appalled would be an understatement. This was easily not just the worst airline experience I’ve had, but really the absolute worst customer service experience I have ever had in the US. When you have a lost or delayed bag, United will give you a little pamphlet that talks about how “checked bags are a reflection of the trust you have in us to provide your personal belongings with safe travels and reliable service. When a bag is delayed, it means we did not uphold that trust. We apologize that this happened and take full responsibility. We will work with you to make the situation right.” Bold words. So far though, it’s been nothing but lip service. All I can say is that I have no trust or faith in United to fully resolve this issue, or any issue, period. When booking tickets for this trip, I thought I’d save a couple hundred bucks since United had cheaper flights than any of the other carriers. What a mistake that was. A couple hundred dollars certainly wasn’t worth having to go through such an unprofessional, horrendous experience.    As it stands, I see little reason for me or anyone to fly United ever again."
Jan 2020,50,Christmas Holiday Flight,"Took the direct flight from San Francisco to Tampa for a Christmas Vacation with family in Florida. We’ve taken this flight several times in the past and, like this flight, it’s always been good. The flight crew was friendly and attentive to our needs. The plane was clean and the seats comfortable. Breakfast was served, quiche, was pretty good and the Flight Attendants served and cleared the trays quickly. The flight was late leaving SFO due to severe winds and runway changes due to the wind. The Pilot was able to make up some of the time but we were still late into Tampa no fault of United. I fly United on a regular bases and they did not disappoint me on this flight and will continue to fly United"
Jan 2020,50,Flight,"What a great flight, the crew was so friendly and professional. If you wanted anything they could do or get for you it was there sooner it seemed than I could have gotten it myself. Flight was on time and landed the same. Very pleased with my flight experience."
Jan 2020,40,I got United as their seats are slightly better,Our flight out was delayed for a ground hold and arrived late but arrived fine  Flight back was good.  We plan to arrive early to avoid issues and never book more than one connection when flying less problems that way.
Jan 2020,50,Things are changing for the better at United Airlines,"Excellent crew on this flight. We left Denver on same flight earlier in our trip. Consistently good choices of food, and service in Business Class is outstanding on these legs. I wish they they would expand the movies/TV choices but it has gotten better on the last two years. Checkin in for Polaris Class in Denver is excellent and the gate checkins in both Denver and Frankfort were easy and smooth.    I really like the new perks for Platinum and 1K for 2020. We need to see if this makes it easier to get upgrades as they have promised.    I might add that I personally few this flight in Economy Plus earlier in the month from Denver to Frankfort. I ordered special meals and felt that the service and comfort were quite good for the price of my ticket."
Jan 2020,30,Reasonably good service staff very courteous and helpful,"I enjoyed flying on the Dreamliner especially after being upgraded to economy plus, which enabled me to enjoy considerable more legroom making it a pleasant flight."
Jan 2020,50,Wonderful flight,"The flight was wonderful. We did fly Business class with seats that become full size beds, so this could be the main reason for how great the flights were. Food was very good, service was amazing. Quick tip ( layover in Newark if possible, they have the United Polaris club. It is world class.)"
Jan 2020,50,United Airlines the best,I had a wonderful flight from Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas by way of San Francisco in December. The flights were great and the flight attendants made the flights more enjoyable by there excellent service!
Jan 2020,10,Worst airline experience ever,"Until today, the RyanAir flight I took from France to Italy was the worst. It was tacky. But it doesn't hold a candle to the bull s**t that is United. The fact that I have to pay for a checked bag, AND I don't get a carry-on is so freaking ridiculous. On top of that, checking in and bag drop took forever, even though everyone had already tagged their own bags at the kiosk, the bag drop took way too long. And then they won't even let you put your laptop in checked luggage. I can't have a carry-on, can't check my computer, so I have to carry my laptop as my personal item. What a load of crap."
Jan 2020,10,Hidden Fees - Poor Customer Service,"At the gate they surprised us with a notice that we have to pay for carry on bags as they aren’t allowed on the flight. Charged us an extra $25 at the gate on top of that for bring the bags all the way to the gate instead of checking them at the kiosk.    Horribly unfriendly, bad condition aircraft, and hidden fees."
Dec 2019,10,SYD to RDU,"Airline nightmare. Pay the little extra and fly Quantas. I paid $270. extra for econ upgrade and was opposite the galley. Started with a glass of red wine spilled on me. Then the fight attendant rolled the drink cart over my bare toe. So ruined pants and a broken toe later, all I get is ""sorry"", Limp to the gate in IAH. The flight from IAH to RDU 3 hours late with no reason. flight cancelled and we de-planed with no expanation. Passenger fight with security having to escort the pax off the flight. Find another plane for us. The only recommendation on my toe and ruined pants, find a dorctor and contact UAL.com. UAL difination: How to treat people like animals."
Dec 2019,10,Happy New Year????? LAX United Club,"We are flying out of LAX to Sydney tonight. Before leaving home I printed out 4 United passes. We had recently used these passes in Denver-when we were not flying United. This made me think that, of course, United would honor them.  So, we walk from Terminal 4 to Terminal 7 (long walk-backpacks and suitcases)-only to told that by Lorna, the desk attendant, that you had to be flying United in order to enter the club. She said that this was posted on the United website. I had researched the Club, location, etc----and never found this condition. I am not questioning that it does appear in the United literature---but better communication is needed! And.....what ever happened to customer service? We frequently fly United, but this makes no difference. Perhaps the era of friendly skies is over.....the club wasn't busy....we had the passes....am I being unreasonable. Anyway....now the rest of you know this ""rule""-United should thank me for this communication!"
Dec 2019,20,Average service had to buy drinks even though international flight from Havana to Mexico city,Meals could be improved. Snack was peanuts on a two hour flight even though this was around dinner time. Something more substantial should be provided
Dec 2019,20,Luggage lost for 2 hours,"We landed in Newark an hour late, on the Tar Mac for half hour. Our luggage never came out . No announcements, no information. Waited on the lost luggage line - 30 people long. After being online for over an hour- our luggage came out on the carosel. Really poorly run will not fly with them again."
Dec 2019,30,Average flight nothing special happened,"Ok event. Just like riding a bus for 5 hours. Not bad, not great. Bring your own food. Changes in frequent flyer program was irritating"
Dec 2019,20,Shame !,"One of the worlds better known international carriers and just very second rate on this route.. Old plane, very disconnected and completely disinterested service. Luckily flight was reasonably short!"
Dec 2019,50,Perfect Final Leg of a RTW Trip,"We experienced a few hiccoughs with various airlines on a December Star Alliance RTW trip, but our final leg on United Express from San Francisco to Tucson went extremely well. Our First-Class, second row seats, in a United Express regional jet (Embraer 175) were comfortable and the cabin was clean. The friendly flight attendant ensured that we were well looked after during the 2-hour flight, offering drinks as well as packaged small snacks and fruit from a big basket.The captain kept us updated, and the flight proved to be incredibly smooth, even with rainy weather in the San Francisco area.    The boarding process also went smoothly, and I was delighted that we entered the plane via a jet way instead of ascending steps from the ground, which often is required for regional jets at this airport. Many passengers left their luggage by the plane's entry to be stored in the hold and picked up on the jet way in Tucson. We had small bags that fit easily in the overhead compartments, which offered limited space.    Departure and arrival went as scheduled. After I exited the plane in Tucson, I realized I had lost a high-tech hearing aid onboard. Staff immediately went to search my seat area and quickly returned with this valuable item. I truly appreciated their efforts, and two passengers, waiting near me to board the plane, applauded."
Dec 2019,50,Great,Great airline loved the Polaris business class seats the food was amazing I slept the plane was super clean all flights were on time except one leaving but it was weather so you couldn’t control the outcome overall great trip definitely recommend
Dec 2019,50,Good customer service,"I fly on United several times per year. Flights are usually on time and the process is smooth. On this trip though, our return flight from San Diego to Denver was delayed. I don't know why for sure, but assume that winter weather somewhere may have been the cause. A message about the delay was sent hours before we would have had to leave for the airport. The delay was going to cause us to miss our flight from Denver to Rock Springs. I called United and the gentleman handling the call was very kind and efficient. He did some research and promptly called me back with two options. He emailed the changed itinerary, and once again it all went smoothly."
Dec 2019,30,DID NOT FIND THIS AIRLINE CUSTOMER FRIENDLY,"Aside from my seat selection, and the semi-friendly air attendants, the entertainment options were below average and the food choices were bland and non-descript. The biggest issued was baggage. I was two pounds over the limit, had no way to reduce the weight, so I was required to pay $166.00 to have my bag accompany me on the flight. Two pounds-absolutely preposterous! United will be my first choice for travel in the immediate future..."
Dec 2019,50,Great Flight on United,"We experienced attentive service, comfortable seating and good food on the last flight we took on United."
Dec 2019,20,business flight,"booked early flight out of ATL (7:am) - received message at 4:30 that flight was delayed - arrived to check in & was told we would miss our connecting flight - clerk offered no assistance initially - after commenting to him what we they going to do about this - he finally said that we would have to fly standby on a different flight - no apologies of any kind were offered - arrived in SF to await connection - clerk at gate sent us to a different gate - that clerk said we were at the right gate the 1st time - 1st clerk then says she's not working that flight to come back in an hour & wait for them to ask for standby passengers - finally the right clerk, who put us on the stand-by list (because the clerk at ATL hadn't) - all around, lousy customer service - made us feel like they could choose to screw us however they wanted and they were not concerned with any fallout - saw another passenger receive a printed boarding pass that was so bad that TSA wouldn't accept it - she had to go all the way back to airline to get a new pass, after waiting in the way long line to TSA - clerk who printed the pass absolutely knew TSA wouldn't accept the pass; but sent her on anyway :("
Dec 2019,10,United Airlines Steals Money,They sold me a ticket to a flight they never intended to fly then wouldn't return my money. Gave me a credit less $200. I will never fly United again.
Dec 2019,50,Great service!,"I absolutely adore United, it’s my preferred airline. The attendants are friendly and courteous, they are largely on time, and they are great with organizing people onto the plane."
Dec 2019,30,What You Expect,So it’s United you know what they offer which is predictable middle of the road. Check in and boarding at heathrow is very well done. The heathrow lounge is very good and breakfast availability for early morning flights is top notch. The seats are good in business class with no complaints. The downside as always with United is food service. This flight now offers a breakfast. So you get up at 6 am to be on a 9 am flight or even earlier so you will have had breakfast who thought this through when offering you that as the only choice around 10 am. The before landing stale pizza is even more ridiculous. On this flight the toilets were dirty and long time layers of dirt and dust clearly visible. Not good United some of the basics are being missed.
Dec 2019,10,SEATS ARE NOT COMFORTABLE,Compared to the flight that we had from TPA to ORD with Spirit the seats were not very comfortable and it was not a very long flight
Dec 2019,10,It was freezing cold in the airplane.,It was so cold in the airplane that I had to have on my heavy winter jacket and a sweater. All I could do in the plan was sleep as it was too cold to concentrate on reading.
Dec 2019,10,Carlos Alvarez,"Biggest piece of crap airline ever used! Never go on these planes, terrible customer service, seating, no TV for a 6 hour plus flight! Delayed with no reasoning. Absolutely ridiculous. Stay Away!"
Dec 2019,40,Much better,"It was my third trip in last eighteen months travel from San Francisco to Hong Kong. The reason I raised to four stars from three stars from my last review is I saw improvement in all aspects, especially the in flight service. One little thing from my own dream list is I want a warmed sandwich in the morning instead of cold one that I always pass."
Dec 2019,10,"Christmas cheer, but only for some","The people in front of us, who had two screaming babies were offered free food and adult beverages, no problem. Of course friends and family of flight attendants were treated with the same generosity. Me, a silver premier member, my wife got a lukewarm tea that was mostly milk practically dumped onto her tray table, with almost no regard. A packed plane, mechanical delay, business as usual on a joyless Christmas flight for all but a select few. Typical San Francisco favoritism, from a poorly mannered crew."
Dec 2019,30,"Polaris Class, not on par with other airlines","Recently had a chance to fly the Polaris Class on UA, the overall experience was average.    The hard product itself was dated, it's the old Polaris Class, with 2-2-2 setting. Good thing was no one was sitting next to me, so I had the 2 seats to myself. If I were to sit with someone, then I would have to ask the person to get up if I needed to go to the washroom, not so convenient especially for Business Class. The seats are comfortable and spacious, but not much privacy is offered. Soft product was again average, the crew was rough around the edges, grooming was poor. Food service was rush, and food presentation was uninspiring. I am most disappointed with one of the crew members, her service was dismissive, showing an attitude of ""I dont care"".    Probably wont fly with them again."
Dec 2019,50,Great employees,"Personable gate agent at LAX was courteous and friendly to all passengers as the aircraft boarded for Lihue. We were met at the aircraft cabin door by a smiling flight attendant by the name of Gwen. Her smile and bubbling personality immediately convinced me that she loved her job and was proud to be assigned to this flight; I was correct. Gwen conversed with all passengers in our area, taking a sincere interest in what they had to say. Our adult children stated that I should have a Mai Tai since we are going to the Hawaiian Islands. Gwen 'doctored' one up for me and boy it was good. My wife and I received a bid suprise when Gwen made the arrival announcement upon landing at Kauai. It was our 50th Wedding Anniversary and we were going to the same resort where we spent our honeymoon. She made everyone aware of this special event. Passengers cheered, clapped, and offered us congratulations. This was a fantastic trip, thanks to the 'class' of Gwen and United Airlines."
Dec 2019,50,Christmas travel,"Unlike other airlines I booked with this year, United was the ONLY airline on time, w/put delays or a canellation! I will make every effort to book my travel with United Airlines in the future."
Dec 2019,50,United debut a sucess,"United has only served my local airport since this fall. Have also gone to Philadelphia with them. Even the small planes are comfortable. The service has been on time, and O'Hare is not the hell hole that Detroit is.Ground crews are helpful & friendly, and flight attendants seem to enjoy being on these short runs. Grateful for the credit card that gives free checked bag."
Dec 2019,50,"Polaris Class, no other way to fly",From the moment you check in you know that this trip is going to be special. The access to the United Club was a great way to start of with a quick cup of coffee and getting organized for the flight. Upon boarding I was asked if they could help by taking my coat and if I wanted anything to drink. The First class flight attendant introduced himself and let us know that if there anything we needed he could assist. The seating pod was amazing and had everything I wanted for the flight. The service and meal were outstanding and everything I wanted was there in moments and made my flight perfect.
Dec 2019,30,EWR,"Why review United, with its vast passenger base? It's about their Newark Liberty hub, and based upon flights in International First (vanishing) / Domestic First (don't bother) / Business (""Polaris""; OK but pricey) / Premium Econ (survivable) / Economy (oh, nooooo ...).    The Newark hub is undergoing some refurbishment, but it's dreary unless you have access to the Polaris Lounge. Terminal C at Newark has multiple dining venues, none much good and all irrationally expensive.    United's hard product is, well, hard except in Polaris. Domestic First just isn't worth it - go Premium Economy, especially on shorter routes to Chicago / Indy / under three hours. You'll survive. Premium Econ at least has some extra legroom. Choose your seat carefully - SeatGuru your flight. United Express flights (""Republic"") are a bit more comfortable than the regular United fleet - again, check SeatGuru.    Service? Um, no. Flight status info from United is consistently unreliable - get one or two of the independent apps for your phone, and/or check the FAA for accurate information.    On my most recent flight, the gate attendant made the dread announcement that the flight was overbooked and bribed some volunteers (not me). I boarded ... and discovered an empty seat next to me in Premium Econ. Crosscheck ... nobody ... yes! ... lift the armrest and spread out! Bizarre, and suggestive of some confusion. I didn't object, though.    Landed at EWR and made my way to the AirTrain. A somewhat surly United employee with a clipboard stopped me and asked to see my boarding pass. ""I'm headed out, not in."" ""Oh, OK."" Not a good way to run an airline Welcome to EWR."
Dec 2019,40,Cuba puts their best looking in Security,"It was my first trip to Cuba. My grandmother sailed into Havana’s Harbor on a cruise ship in 1950. So our Pan American Art Tour group of 12 didn’t know what to expect the last week of April.    The friendly but serious airport security took our photo and printed it on a piece of paper to give to customs. We then proceeded to an upscale 1950s style lounge where serve-your-self bottles of Havana Club rum sat on a bar while we waited for our transportation.    The males in the group all brought carry-on luggage. The females were smarter. Their checked bags were large enough to bring home some duty free souvenirs.    Having flown to Europe and the U.S. these past years, flying into and out of Havana was a much more pleasurable experience than in any TSA run U.S. airport."
Dec 2019,50,Best air line,"So comfortable seat , lots of room for legs. Flight was on time both departure and arrival. Checking was easy and some agents were very nice , few don’t have customer service. But flight inside is great so much room to relax. Thank you for your great service. I will see you soon in next year 2020."
Dec 2019,40,FIrst Class Flight,"We flew first class from Denver to Orlando and returned same. Everything went very smoothly, no issues. Luggage arrived both ways as well.    Our dinner was the exact same meal we had on a previous United flight in September. Didn't care for it either time. Not sure how often United changes their dinner meal in First Class but would recommend doing away with the noodle meal we were served on both flight."
Dec 2019,50,"Airline Fine, But Airport Not the Best Organized","Signs were not clear upon entry into airport that if you already were checked-in on-line, you could go to a kiosk, print your baggage check tags and thus bypass the LONG LINE and WAIT at the counter. We had plenty of time before boarding so not a big issue, just annoying. Gate and flight attendant crews did an excellent job getting people boarded quickly. As a result, we left on-time, and arrived early. B-737-800 was a newer aircraft and the entertainment linked to United WiFi performed very well. Good choice of free and purchased food. I tried to buy something, and when the credit card system bugged out, the flight attendant comped my meal --- good on-site problem solving! In-flight service was excellent. Not the airline's doing, but I was very happy to have the middle seats empty next to my aisle seat."
Dec 2019,50,"Efficient Boarding, Left and Arrived Early, Good Service","Well passengers FINALLY are adhering to the carry-on bag rules. Gate and flight attendant crews did an excellent job getting people boarded quickly. AS a result, we left early, and arrived early for a family vacation and birthday celebration for my daughter (the dreaded #40!). B-737-900 was a newer aircraft and the entertainment linked to United WiFi performed very well. Good choice of free and purchased food. In-flight service was excellent. Not the airline's doing, but I was very happy to have both seats empty next to my aisle seat."
Dec 2019,40,"Last minute flight, days before Christmas, great service","The airport in general is a mess the weekend before Christmas. Employees could easily be frustrated and short, however everyone I dealt with was still friendly without having to force it.    The lines were astronomical, but the United employees smiled and got us through as quickly as possible. They had their system to get us through the kiosks, our luggage whisked away and on to the next person. They were just as efficient throughout the process. So much so that my luggage was able to get on an earlier flight. This did cause a little concern for me as I continued to wait for it until all luggage had gone through the carousel as I didn't check my email after taking my phone off airplane mode. Arrived safely and quickly, with a friendly crew on board as well."
Dec 2019,30,United Economy from SFO to MEL - average at best,"This was a 15 hours and 40 minutes flight on a Boeing 787-900. Love the aircraft and the flight although very long was pretty smooth most of the way. Unfortunately the economy seat is very narrow with a decent 32"" leg room (United says). Seats are very hard and they barely recline (2"" maybe?). Flight attendance were great but food and drinks are very minimal for such a long flight and below average for quality and quantity."
Dec 2019,50,I was impressed,The plane was very clean the flight attendants were very nice and helpful. The pilot did a great job as well keeping us informed on where we were and how soon we would be landing.
Dec 2019,40,Good Airlines,"We flew from PDx to Chicago to MIA. It was a long day with a 3hr 40 min layover. in Chicago. The staff a United was nice and willing to assist if needed. The polite was very informative and keeping us up with what was going on and how much longer til we landed. I couldn't get my flight entertainment to corporate while on the flight, but the next flight I was able to use the inflight entertainment. I appreciated the drinks and snack on the flight it was much welcomed due to the long wait for the next flight. The landing was quite bumpy, but grateful we landed safely. To land a plane smoothly is a skill and I think in my over 25 years of traveled I have have the pleasure to experience it 4 times. Over all it was a good flight no complaints."
Dec 2019,10,Multiple maintenance issues,delayed in Dulles for 3+ hours with lots of other stranded travelers because the planes that kept coming in all had maintenance issues which took hours to resolve. One plane had to have a tire changed due to a nail. How can 3 planes come in back to back and all have serious maintenance issues???
Dec 2019,30,United doesnt treat First class passengers right,"I recently travelled from ORD to MSP with first class tickets, and was surprised to know that we cannot use their lounge. I bought first class ticket with assumption that I can....was very dissapointed.    Check-in process was not great either."
Dec 2019,40,Comfortable,Flew in Premium Plus and found this extremely comfortable. Food was nice and tasty. Airline crew worked hard and remained courteous throughout. Refreshments served regularly. Pilot gave us all a safe and smooth flight. Travelled onward to Orlando on a smaller plane - unfortunately that landing was not good and seemed rather heavy on the breaks. That said I recommend United Airlines to everyone.
Dec 2019,30,Washington DC to Knoxville TN,Regional jet very narrow body jet good only for short flights. Mine was 1 hour 10 minutes so it was bearable.
Dec 2019,40,Tel Aviv to Washington DC,Sat in premium economy seat 20A. Seat was very comfortable and i had enough room but had I do not think it's worth the price. If you can get economy seats new emergency exit door it would be just as good. Also for the price of the seats they should include free WiFi!
Dec 2019,50,United airlines and their mileage plus card makes UA greatest airline,"Use United card and UA vacations to plan my trips. 2 free bags, priority boarding , and reasonable upgrades makes for an easy vacation"
Dec 2019,50,Everything was on time.,The flight left on time and arrived at my destination early. That is what an airline is supposed to do. Had a beverage and a snack inn flight and the attendant was friendly. No frills. The flight was a little bumpy but that wasn't the fault of United.
Dec 2019,50,Flew to NC for Christmas!,"I haven't flown United much, but needed a direct flight to NC to visit my family for the holidays. I was a little late in booking my flight, but overall, it wasn't over the top expensive, only about $125 more than I normally pay. The flights were both on time and the staff was very professional. I would have to say I would definitely consider flying United in the future if they had good prices for the routes I was taking."
Dec 2019,40,"Good service, comfortable seats, nice media.",I liked the fact that the person in front of you can't incline his seat all the way up to your nose. It inclines just enough to make everyone comfortable. Nice space for the legs. With some Airlines I have my knee cap right on the back seat.  Stewardesses seem a bit tired and fed up with years of flight attendants in experience so don't count on some of them to go over board or be anything but strict.
Dec 2019,10,Horrible,Never flying United again. Terrible customer service and terrible attitudes all around. Completely ripped us off on money. Totally ruined our Christmas. I have never dealt with such problems with an airline. Will be sticking to southwest from now on.
Dec 2019,10,TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE,NEVER AGAIN!!! UNITED IS A SHAME TO THIS WORLD!  They decided to cancel my reservation 2 hours before my check in time without any notice. They kept telling me to buy a new ticket after I had already bought one for over 1000 dollars. The people that are assisting at the terminal are horrible people and I did not find one person that had a smile on their face! No help whatsoever and terrible attitude from everyone on their service!
Dec 2019,20,Don’t do a job you can’t do with Grace,Hi. I just arrived on UA 869 and half the team on the flight was so unfriendly. I asked someone if I could have lunch later and then later asked at time of serving whether I could change it as I had changed my mind. The Team leader made it seem like I committed some crime by changing my mind when I didn’t mind if more time was required for prep. I hadn’t put a time limit on the request? I had literally said was it ok to make the change. Was so ridiculous.  Then I ordered coffee and it wasn’t hot so I asked if it could be made hot and the answer was “it’ll be as hot as it can get on the plane”.  Finally on the way to the bathroom I asked for a snack and then on the way out I asked for a champagne and walked to the seat. Mistakenly assuming it would be brought to the seat. I waited and waited and finally got up and went to the galley and it was waiting there. I asked if that was mine and the stewardess shrugged her shoulders and said yes. Why you couldn’t walk over and bring the drink and next time say there is no service between meals or whatever the protocol is as who knows I don’t know instead of stubbornly just leaving it there for 20mins till the passenger realised. It’s just petty. People are just unnecessarily rude I’ve realised. Irrespective of class of travel. It’s just never required. Don’t do a job you don’t want to do!
Dec 2019,20,Seat comfort,Easily the most uncomfortable seating I have experienced on any flight. Might have been adequate for 2 hours but actually painful for a long haul.
Dec 2019,10,Worst flight experience ever!,This is my first and probably the last time I fly with United Airlines. My flight was delayed for over 9 hours with no compensation. I was not able to attend an event I had already paid for due to the delay. Once I arrived to Denver the airline misplaced my luggage and now I have been waiting more than 15 hours to receive my luggage. Trying to contact customer service has been a nightmare and even had a baggage claim representative hang up on me while I looked for a confirmation number.
Dec 2019,10,Flight 2366 track meet,Never again will I fly with United. We had 4 gates changes. All the passengers are running from F terminal to E terminal Kept telling us the plane was about to land. After the 3rd gate change a they finally announce that their hauling a plane from the hangar. What hell?! Now we need a new plan. Just ridiculous.
Dec 2019,10,United is incompetent,"United either has the oldest planes or doesn’t maintain them because they are constantly having flight delays due to mechanical problems. Again we sit for five hours while United blames the weather. Then they say it’s mechanical. Now we are back to the weather excuse. No weather. Starry moon lit night on both ends. “Oh we had to deice”. Sorry, Denver airport says no deicing going on. Okay they have run out of BS and finally admitted they had a mechanical issue, again, and had to find another plane. Just abysmal customer service."
Dec 2019,20,Prices get bigger and the planes get smaller.,"I cannot believe the way they pack people in those planes. No nuts or anything to eat. It was unbearable so uncomfortable im only 5'2"" 107 lbs and i was smooshed i wont ever fly on umited if its over a 2 hour flight!!!! Crabby flight atte dants too !!!"
Dec 2019,30,"UA Better than Most, but 737-9 Planes have One Serious Issue","I generally like United Airlines. I have been a higher-level frequent flyer for over 15 years.    I have begun avoiding the 737-900 aircraft for one what I consider serious issue.    These planes have a single lavatory between first class and coach, behind row 6 usually. These lavatories always smell foul. When the aircraft first began being used, the airline started using some kind of ""air freshener"" in these lavatories, a smell that is worse than the original smell.    So if you're sitting in the first few rows of coach (which are called Economy Plus) you get gagged by this smell for the entire flight."
Dec 2019,50,Fabulous Ticket Counter Service,"Due to an error on my part, my return flight from BDL to IAD was not reserved like I thought.  The United ticket counter manager, Chris Williams, was very sympathetic to our problem and got us on the next available flight at no extra charge.  IAD would never make an accommodation like this as they are very arrogant.  Thank you Mr Williams for saving the day and keeping us with United.✈️"
Dec 2019,10,Over promise under deliver,"I'll be short and to the point. The flights were good and cheap. Clean and efficient. However, the way they handle baggage issues is atrocious. First, they lost my bags on the way to Montana. It took almost 90 minutes at the desk to get anything resolved. My bags were delivered next day at 9PM. I lost an entire day of activities due to a lack of equipment. On the way back, they lost my bags yet again. Promised me at 12PM they would be delivered same day to my location. I called at 8PM to check up. The estimated wait time was 10-15 minutes. I was on hold for 80 minutes before I gave up and hung up. Currently I have no idea where my bags are, when I can expect them, or if they've even made it to this state. I have work clothes in those bags and meetings in the morning. Very poor customer service. They should only promise what they can deliver to prevent this kind of disappointment."
Dec 2019,10,Terrible,Waited on runway after landing for over an hour and a half. This airline X Newark airport is a joke and they do nothing to try and fix their issues in a timely manner. Just absurd!
Dec 2019,20,Tired 777-200,Plane was well over 20 years old and it showed. No food for a nine hour flight. The Hawaii product from ORD is terrible.
Dec 2019,10,Worst first class experience ever!,First of all i recently flew Delta first class and had an amazing experience you are greeted with a pillow blanket and water from the very start it was wonderful!    We are United explorer card holders and i am seriously thinking of changing that to a Delta Card. The lady on the first leg of the trip was very rude i was given what was left of the meals after everyone else chose. The plane was a big piece of crap and even being in first class had no screen to watch movies on a 3 hour flight. was only offered a couple of drinks. The next flight into new orleans was even worse! no meal what so ever only a cheap snack. This was ridicules because this is the reason to fly first class. The layover was 4 hours long then to only get a small snack was so cheap of united. I had the worse experience on this flight coming back from Christmas. I despise United i really hate that we have the credit card that supports this airline! if you have a choice fly delta!
Dec 2019,20,Inflight service?,"Flight left somewhat on time. Screens in front of the seat worked. Terrible tasting food. Variety of entertainment was bad. Filthy bathrooms. Staff didn’t seem to care if you got served, needed anything, didn’t even bother telling passengers that they had kept out snacks in the galleys. Check-in staff smiled but didn’t bother telling you that they ignored your request. Wouldn’t fly them on such a long flight again unless it was the only option or really really cheap."
Dec 2019,10,United Airlines is the worst!,First flight LAX to DEN Dec 29 delayed 5 hours due to mechanical breakdown. Changed us to another flight with two legs instead of direct. Get to the end of the first leg and the next leg is delayed 2 hours due to mechanical breakdown. I will spend the rest of my life letting everyone know how bad this airline is. Fliers should boycott this airline for one month demanding that Oscar Munoz step down. Disgusting excuse for an airline.
Dec 2019,10,Do not fly with United,"This airline purposely overbooks flights to make more money then does not refund you if the flight is full. My partner and I had to purchase entirely new flights, as United wouldn’t even get us confirmed seats on another flight, only a waitlist. Then on our flight home we paid for seat allocated and they seated us separately, and wouldn’t fix it or refund us. Do yourself a favor and do not fly with them."
Dec 2019,10,Worst company,They are unprofessional and have no manners in their customer service. I would recommend against flying United because they don’t care about their customers. Their workers have the audacity to be rude on the phone. Never again.
Dec 2019,30,Not Great Not Bad,Pretty average flight. Disappointed not to receive any complimentary meals but we got free drinks at least. The leg space was minimal but not horrible. Seats weren’t very comfy though.
Dec 2019,20,terribly uncomfortable seats for a long flight,"I have flown on quite few long flights overseas. This was the most tortuous I have ever experienced. The seat was very uncomfortable and I was not able to sleep at all on this overnight flight of 8 hours despite the sleep aid I took. A terrible experience. Ironically, the next flight, on a new and different United plane, was 2.5 hours and was very comfortable."
Dec 2019,20,"Paid Extra, They Failed","The new basic economy scam got me. I paid the extra $60 to “upgrade” so I could choose my seats and bring my carry on. Last leg of my flight they stuck me in a windows seat when I chose all isle seats.    Additionally, the entertainment is not impressive. Compared to what is offered on other airlines, it is pathetic, and they don’t have screens in the seat back, for many flights. Even the 5-6 hour flight to Hawaii. You use your own phone, IF you have the app downloaded, or else you’re SOL.    The thing that really got me about the whole trip was the extremely rude flight attendant on my flight from SFO to KOA. Older male. I’ll never fly with them again if this is their new customer service standard. He was rude, inconsiderate, and condescending, in general. I sit toward the back of the plane and could hear his conversations with passengers who would approach the lavatories and his comments and conversations about passengers, to the other flight attendant.    The one thing that impressed me about United, during this trip, was the speed of the boarding process. It was quick and smooth."
Dec 2019,30,Improving...but,"It’s been 4 years since we flew United although I do have a ton of miles so we got a mileage redemption for this trip, paying extra on the HNL to SFO leg for exit seats which for a 5 hr flight were well worth it.  Check in was fine, lots of self adhesive bag tags, $30 per bag to check in. Because the flight was totally full we agreed to check in our carry on as well which was done for free.  The 777-200 didn’t have tv screens but you could access their portal and download films to your device which worked fine to be fair. The service on board began quickly with drinks and breakfast options which I paid for on my credit card, they forgot to charge me for one of them which was a bonus! Service was much improved from previous experiences although their dress code does intrigue me as they were all dressed differently.  The flight itself was great and we landed early at SFO 1 hr 50 minutes before our connection to SEA.  The connection left on time too on a 737-800. Leg room was definitely not as good on this flight but it was a relatively short flight. Service again was reasonable and we got a couple of drinks and snacks, although it is a shame they don’t do gluten free snacks like Delta as my partner is gf. So unless you pay you don’t eat.  We landed early again testing the brakes on landing which was fun, got to baggage reclaim and quickly our carry ons that we checked in came out... but not our original checked bags. Looking at the app they hadn’t made the Seattle flight and were on the next flight due to land 2 hrs later. The staff were very good, we weren’t the only ones in this position and arranged for them to be delivered to our hotel in the early hours, which they were without incident. However we landed 1 hr 50 mins before our next departure. Our carry ons that had been checked in made it, but our main cases didn’t. Given the timeframe I would suggest they need to employ different baggage handlers because it is scandalous.  That said the onboard product is much improved, I have a lot of miles with United still and I would fly again with them. Still not in Delta’s league but way way better than the joke that is American."
Dec 2019,10,Will never buy another ticket,"I will never buy another ticket, people were sick seated beside me and there were seats right in front of me and they would not let me move. They do not know anything about costumer service. Last ticket I will buy."
Dec 2019,10,AWFUL COMPANY & AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,Awful company & awful people. I won’t be surprised when United goes out of business in 5 years. They truly don’t value customer service like the other airlines. I will never fly United again & I know so many people that would say the same. They have an awful name in the airline industry. Spend your money on Delta or SW!
Dec 2019,20,Greedy Airline,Never using United again..They changed their rules to gain more money. The service is awful. I recommend flying other airlines.
Dec 2019,10,Worst airline in terms of everything,"Flights are always delayed, staff are always rude, and don’t recall having any good experience with them before."
Dec 2019,10,I won’t ever recommend UNITED Airlines to anyone or use their services anymore THEY ARE RUDE AND CARELESS!!,"United Airlines only cares to take your money they don’t care if they are overbooked and everyone out of the 4 flights we had to take on this trip was rude and ridiculous...  .Let’s start by saying most airlines let you board first when flying with kids younger then 6 and that seems about right ,welll Not United only younger then 2 years old!!! What????? Yep I know!!!    “Family seating is not an option”. “Carry on is not an option”. BUT ....seating family far from each other is an option ....seating a 1 year old one seat away from her mother is an option....I guess that’s what you get when booking economic,because United airline doesn’t care I guess might as well let me push the airplane because I didn’t pay enough to earned a seat .This airline is a joke !!!!!    Our 1st flight was delayed by an hour by United’s fault not ours ,then when we finnally arrived at Houston’s airport when exiting the gate we asked the UNITED airlines representative to Please ask for a cart for us to take us to our gate cause our flight was wrapping up boarding and that was the only flight for the night and we were with a 1 year old .... our gate was far by at least 1 mile and the representative said no if u wait for the cart u won’t have time I think is better if u guys just run!!! What!!!??? Like wth are u kidding me ???we had 2 back packs and the diaper bag plus the stroller and a 1 year old ....I’m still catching my breath....  I kinda forgot this is the same airline that got sued for beating up a guy well won’t make the same mistake twice I hope this help someone and prevent them for making the same mistake !!"
Dec 2019,10,Horrible Services,"Got my luggage with a missing wheel and went straight to the baggage department. I was told there was no point in filing a claim since my luggage was ""strapped"". My luggage was strapped with TSA approved lock. I argued it shouldnt be a big deal as the damage was outside and not inside my luggage. She kept on rejecting my plea. So I filed a claim online, and was only given a 75$ travel voucher which definitely helps on getting me a new luggage."
Dec 2019,10,Cowards not willing to represent the country or be responsible for their mistakes,"Return flight from Cancun was delayed from 8pm to 9:30am with no warning. Called customer support after spending hundreds of dollars we can't afford to extend hotel stay. They couldn't connect us to anyone speaking English for an hour. Finally they refused to take any financial responsibility for their failure to provide promised service. We traveled worldwide and whenever our travel was disrupted in much poorer countries - Turkey, Mexico, Estonia - companies involved went out of the way to minimize our inconvenience and reimburse us for our expenses. Except for the largest American airline. I guess leadership of United takes no pride in being American and providing at least a customer experience on par with 3rd world countries. Sad!"
Dec 2019,10,Worst baggage claim department,"For some reason the plane took off without loading everyone’s luggage. We didn’t find out that all our luggage were still in Hawaii until after waiting 45 min at the baggage carousel. Spent all day trying to reach baggage department which United apparently outsourced somewhere in India. The people I spoke to were rude, unprofessional and completely useless. 1 week later I still cannot get a hold of them and my bags are still lost. Will never use this airline again. They only care about profits. Even the seats shrank and have absolutely zero leg room. My knees were up against the back of the seat in front. I’ve flown business class, premium economy and basic economy on other airlines. This is by far the most uncomfortable seat for economy in any airline."
Dec 2019,10,They will separate your seats,"Very disappointed because they separated our seats with my fiance. We particularly called and asked them to put our seats together almost 24 hours in advance (as soon as the check-in was available) and they just ignored it, even tho promised to take care of it.  I saw there were available rows with 2 seats but looks like they do not care about their clients.  I also found a bag of opened cookies and overall seat pockets were dusty and dirty.    I hope do not have such an experience anymore and will choose another airlines in the future."
Dec 2019,20,Poor Service - not what I expect from first class seats!,"I was treated to first class seats by my boyfriends parents and was looking forward to the experience. Unfortuantely, i was very disappointed by the service provided by United Airlines - and in fact, aside from a bit of extra leg room, probably was not much different to economy. I found the staff attending to first class customers to be rude, ignorant and generally unhelpful. There were no veggie options offered at lunch, they were out of certain drinks when asked, the toilet was dirty, and the seats had not been cleaned from the flight before ours (dirty tissue found in the pocket). Very. very disappointed, especially given the expense paid for those seats."
Dec 2019,40,Convenient Service,"Traveled from my home town airport. TSA was quick & efficient, no long lines. Connected in Chicago with adequate time to get to our next flight. In flight wifi was  free to watch a movie while we traveled. Orlando is a test as usual, TSA pre-check really helped there. Only problem was 1 of our checked pieces of luggage was damaged to destruction. We didn't lose anything, however, the suitcase is no longer serviceable."
Dec 2019,20,Untidy bathroom,The customer service in United airlines is so poor. In spite of paying for premium economy we were seated in less than basic economy type of seat. Our row was right next to the bathroom and it was not cleaned at all. Right from the time we walked in there was stench and we could barely breath.
Dec 2019,50,Dulles to Denver,A great flight experience from check-in to arrival. With premier access and TSA-pre I was able to get through check-in and security in less than 30 minutes. The gate area had plenty of seating and access to power for personal electronic devices. Boarding was smooth and efficient. In-flight entertainment was available through the United App. Overall a comfortable flight.
Dec 2019,10,"My Luggage arrived 4 days late, wet, and smelling like Urine","Upon arriving to Puerto Rico and waiting for our luggage that never came, we approached the United kiosk and were told that our luggage was left behind in Newark. They told me that the suitcases were probably left behind because there was no more space on the aircraft. After 4 days, we received our luggage. The delivery person told me that the suitcases had arrived on December 25, but they weren’t scheduled to be delivered until the December 26 at 1pm. Keep in mind that I leave on December 31. I got my things half way through my trip and that’s only AFTER I called repeatedly. Upon initial inspection, we noticed that the content in the bags was moist, and as we started to remove the items, we noticed that the clothing smelt like urine. We checked all the contents of both our bags and they are all damp and producing the foul and pungent odor of urine.    My younger sister is a minor and to have all her clothing wet and smelling like urine is disturbing.    We are in shock and utter disbelief that a company like United would allow our property (paid to be securely transported) to be damaged and defiled in such a violating way.    I am more in shock that United IS NOT taking responsibility for this. I have called multiple times and I have written emails. I even returned to the airport and nothing. I was offered a $150 travel credit that I denied because that doesn’t even come close to what it will cost to replace my things and the trip that they have completely ruined.    I travel all over the world and this has NEVER happened to me before. This has been a horrible experience and during the holidays when all I wanted was to have a good time with my family.    Maybe United’s disregard for me and my sister has to do with the fact that we are here in Puerto Rico visiting family and not the main land USA, so they don’t place much importance on us. Honestly I can’t tell you why we are being treated so poorly.    Most of my clothing is dark colors but I did find one shirt that was wet and stained when I opened my suitcase for the first home after 4 days. What was done inside my suitcases or where the suitcases were left, I’ll never know. I washed all my clothing before traveling so I can tell you that these stains, smell, and moisture wasn’t there when I left Portland, Oregon."
Dec 2019,40,8hrs long great service,"So our cabin crew from start to landing was excellent. The staff taking care of us to extra time on our daughter, who enjoyed it in between her naps a lot.  Upon start, she was very loud, very clear on front row requirements of no crap on the floors, same with the serving the food and the funky way of how the foldable tables worked. Upon landing the kiddo decided to do a grand drama show as she wanted to go potty which obviously we didnt let her. Both staff members walked over to check on her and made it clear to all the passengers of the issue and no one made a fuzz about it. So heads off to this particular crew, we are genuinely impressed. Much better then our return flight with Lufthansa."
Dec 2019,50,Nice flight,"Flight got delayed ,flight crew needed rest.. United put us up in a hotel and food changed our flights the way we wanted."
Dec 2019,40,LAX to London,"Long flight to London, service was good on the flight, the food was okay in economy. We had no issues on the flight,"
Dec 2019,40,The usual,"My husband and I fly Star Alliance to Romania round trip twice a year (sometimes more). The trip to and from Chicago is the first and last part of the trip, depending on whether we’re coming or going. It is a 1 1/2 hour flight. The flight is on what we call the cigarette plane—skinny, regional jet. It seats 2 and 1. There is room for you and little else. But, that is true of most regional jets. The only complaint I have with this flight is it is often delayed. This last time our flight was an hour late taking off on our return flight. The crew came from one place and the pilot from another, both of which were delayed.    I have no complaints about United Airlines as a whole. Our flight attendants have always been courteous. There is often only one flight attendant on this flight. The person has a lot of responsibility and has to deal with all types of passengers—whining, complaining, happy, scared, entitled.    If you fly much, you know American airlines do not have the same standard of care or quality as many other airlines. But, this is true of all American airlines, not just United."
Dec 2019,10,"Terrible service, broken luggage","I had to gate check my bag, so I left it on the tarmac as directed. When I picked it up upon arrival in Denver, the handle had been broken off. It’s sturdy, quality Samsonite luggage that was not at all damaged when I left it with them, but United managed to break it. The flight departed late (boarding took forever; the only gate agent disappeared a few times during boarding for no apparent reason), and when we landed, we sat there for a long time because the pilot didn’t pull close enough to the jet bridge and they had to end up towing us in). It was mistake after mistake, and it’s typical for United."
Dec 2019,30,If sardines could fly,"I am Canadian, I get one trip a year. My trip started from Vancouver Canada. I flight was round trip to Florida to connect with a cruise. My problems started in Vancouver. First I will say this. I am in my late 50’s. I use computers as a tool at work. That does not mean that I am technically savvy. I did a pre check in the day before my flight. I tried to use those terminals, so that I would not have to bother an agent. But those terminals do not like me and told me I had to get help from an agent. But they only had one agent on, so I had to wait a long time. As United had an LA flight going out, and I was not in a hurry. I allowed others to leapfrog ahead of me. I finally got pre checked in. The next morning, I just had my suitcase to check in and I was on my way. YVR customs and security are very professional. No one shouts. The signs are clear. You do not have to remove shoes, belts or wallets. But this is not the case at Ft. Lauderdale airport. Their signs are not clear. Their TSA shout and are grumpy. The signs are confusing. They make you remove your shoes, your belt. My pants fell as I had to raise my arms. The guy just stood their and shoot his head. I was mad and frustrated as even though they have those fancy scanners. Then the guy groped me. I will not travel nor will I ever give a positive word to anyone about this airport. They need to send their staff to Vancouver to see how they do it. United could not give me the connection gate. The wifi was not working proper on the plane. We arrived at Chicago early, then had to sit on the tarmac 20 minutes. I asked a flight attendant if she had a way of finding out what gate to go to for my connection. She said she would get back to me but never did. I had to ask help from a couple of pilots from another airline how to get to my new gate. I have a heart condition. I had to run to make my connection. United says that you can connect in time. That is if you are young. But for those who are older. I recommend a connection time of an hour and a half or longer. Especially if you are going to an unfamiliar airport. It is not fun to half to run. My connection flight was well into boarding. The flight from Chicago to Vancouver. The passenger behind me was six feet or taller. His legs went all the way under my chair and I was kicked and bumped all the way to Vancouver. It was very unfair. The flight crew was good. But having an Outside seat, every time someone walked past, I was bumped. The flight may have been 4 hours but between between being kicked from the guy behind and being bumped from those walking. Oh and when they cleaned the plane between flights. They did not remove the garbage from the bins and the toilets had not been cleaned properly. Now I know why people will pay more and fly with the competition. I am not impressed. I filled a complaint with United, but never got a response."
Dec 2019,10,Worse airline ever,"Had a trip to New York booked, flying with united...delayed 3 times, 14 and a half hours late ...never again will I travel with this airline"
Dec 2019,40,A Nice Flight home!,The flight was uneventful (something that everybody on a flight hopes for) but enjoyable. There was not a lot of turbulence and the pilot kept everyone informed as to what was happening on the flight. We even gained time on the way home too! A very good flight on United Airlines!
Dec 2019,20,Small Seats and small snacks,"Took a roundtrip from Houston to Frankfurt Germany. The seats are small(felt like i had compression pants on). The flight attendants were good, but the food service was terrible compared to other overseas flights I have taken. The flight back was almost 11 hours and the drink cart came by twice. Just after takeoff we were given a small chicken and risotto with a roll and no dessert, and just before landing a sandwich only. All in all I would give United 2 stars for international service."
Dec 2019,30,Overpriced and not totally worth it,"I booked a flight from FRA to SFO for over 3000$ in Polaris Business Class. I would have preferred to book through Delta as it's cheaper, it has better service, and they have great reviews, but I'm stuck with United as I live in SF. The prices are way too high compared to their competitors and they do not even offer the best service."
Dec 2019,50,St. Louis to Roatan,Flight from St. Louis to Roatan with one stop in Houston. Great flight on time and plenty of time for connecting flight
Dec 2019,10,"Forced to check bag and pay for it, no on-board entertainment","Worst airline practices I have yet experienced. This is the 4th flight on united where I had no outlet to charge my device and they don't provide entertainment without using the United app on my device. Also, I have not yet been able to connect to their entertainment using the app. If you don't install the app before flying you can't access content. I installed it before my next flight and still could not watch content. No outlets to charge devices either. Recently there force economy passengers to pay $30 to check carry on size baggage. DO not fly United if you can help it."
Dec 2019,40,Coming back to Raleigh,"Flew out of the old New Orleans airport. No one was really wanting to engage. I think they were all waiting to go and start at the new aiport or just tired. Flight was OK when we were able to get on the plane. None of the airlines seem to really care. Flew several years ago, different attitude from the entire industry. I know that everyone works hard but flights are stressful also."
Dec 2019,30,Smaller airbus,"On a trip from Las Vegas to Leon México, the flight within the US was on a very tight double 3 rows type of plane. Isle seats have very narrow leg room, seats were worn down and thin. However , the airbus used by UA from Houston to Leon Mexico were much roomier, better leg rooms and with double 2 rows seating arrangements. The seats were more cushioned, could be a newer plane, but certainly made the travel more pleasant. For a bit more money, perhaps it may be worth looking into premium economy or business class if we can afford it or our health and well being would justify it."
Dec 2019,30,Nightmare,"Flight was Phoenix to Chicago to Dayton. I hate Chicago, always get delayed. Who would've thought we'd have a delay in Phoenix due to a thunderstorm. Came late into Chicago. There were seven of us to catch the connection to Dayton. We got to our gate 3 minutes late and not a soul around. You would think United could've held the flight. But since we had to be at work the next day we had to rent a car and drive to Dayton."
Dec 2019,40,Great price,"First time booking a flight with no checked bag. My only complaint about this was that I you check into my flight prior to arriving at the airport, but this is understandable as they need to confirm I only had a personal item. Flights were all in time and the text notifications helped keep me on time in all the airports."
Dec 2019,50,Best flight in the last dozen on multiple airlines!,"Smooth flight, good landing, no turbulence and the seats were much more comfortable then other recent flights on their competitors airlines. Staff was pleasant and although there was some baby noise, that is life when you fly around Xmas time especially."
Dec 2019,30,Spain Trip - Vegeterian Meal - (NOT),"Firstly, I have traveled United too many times to count. This time, as ususal, we had pre-booked Hindu Vegeterian meal. When our meal arrived, it had chicken. When we informed the flight attendant, she said "" I will see if we have any vegeterian meals, and if we have any left, I will give it to you."" Considering we had reserved vegeterian meal, that is not what I want to hear. We got a vegan meal, which was bland at best. The good thing is on the way back from Spain we had much better experience. Which will be in my next review."
Dec 2019,10,UA179 .. I am still stuck in SFO,Waited.. delayed... push back... de board.. change flight in SFO when it is a direct flight... stuck in SFO... said maintenance staff crew not informed... it's going to be a near 30hours trip for me now    I trust United will not be bothered to read this but their poor planning has already made a statement...    Last choice of airline I will choose moving forward..
Dec 2019,20,UA dropped the ball on this one.,"Packed 300 + people plane. Many staffers with poorest customer service. Had call button light on for over 30 minutes and no one came. Wanted coffee and water. Seemed disarrayed, disorganized and spaced out. Crew members could be seen arguing amongst themselves.    Delivery of first dinner was sloppy. Choice of chicken with Mac n cheese or pasta. Salad was greens with 2 slices yellow pepper. Stale dessert cookie. Did not know what hard drinks were served. No other service after that. Not even water. All staff disappeared after that.    Next lunch service was pasta again or chicken Wrap with little chicken. Same salad. More wrap than filler. A real joke. Chocolate piece for dessert.    Really—-serving pasta for both meals and empty salad? No fruit. This is premium economy???? No menu change. No proper meal planning. Better varied good in primary school grades. Unacceptable. No repeat service.    Do not pay for this ticket.  Not worth it.  Bring your own food.  Was not offered the company UA Tapas Box, also unusual for Silver 1K status.    Wonder what the return flight will be like?"
Dec 2019,30,Knees not pleased,"I'm sure it's not just Flt 810 but this particular plane had less legroom than any commercial plane I've ever flown on. I was in 36A, an economy seat in the back part of the plane, and I practically had to wedge myself into my seat. Both my knees were in constant contact with the seat in front of me and there was literally no way to find relief other than standing up. By the time we got to SFO both knees were scraped raw. I sent a note to United Customer Service and all they did was listen. NO offers of anything at all. Shoot, they'll give you a $100 voucher if the entertainment system doesn't work, but they won't compensate you for any injuries like I received."
Dec 2019,10,Customer service,"United Airlines’ customer service needs a serious change with their attitude and how they interact with their customers. They should have more patience and when customers have questions they should not be snappish and act like we are wasting their time. They work in a customer service for goodness sake, if they can’t have a proper attitude in dealing with travelers, then they are in a wrong profession. I’m not surprised though that I received this kind of treatment from UA. It happened to me before having to deal with rude customer service agent and I never wanted to fly with UA ever again but unfortunately, my Alaska Airlines flight was cancelled and they rerouted me to UA."
Dec 2019,40,Jan - UA2351 PHX to SFO 737-900ER FC Seat 3E & F,"On Tuesday, January 15, we flew United Airlines UA2351 from Phoenix (PHX) to San Francisco (SFO) in First Class, on a 737-900ER (#3439). We were in Row 3 E&F. This ship was from the Continental side of the fleet, so had DirectTV. This plane did not have the newer interior, with the “Dreamliner” ceiling and lighting, and also had the old, smaller overhead bins. The only downside of the sCO part of the fleet of 737's, is that the DirectTV equipment takes up a fair amount of the underseat storage, but my wife’s rolling briefcase fit nicely above, and with a bit of wedging, my briefcase fit below the seat in front of me..    We started this trip in the PHX United Club, in T2, across from Gate 7, with the Moët et Chandon Brut Champagne, but then moved to the O.H.S.O. restaurant, across from Gate 7 in T2, when our flight was delayed, due to ATC issues at SFO. Since we were going to miss lunch in San Francisco, this seemed like a good idea. This allowed us to keep an eye on our gate, and be prepared to join the boarding, should the Ground Hold be lifted early. We had just flown from LAX to SFO, then home to PHX a few days before, and the weather was bad then, and had not improved at all. Also, on this morning, the weather at PHX was not all that much better, with heavy clouds, but no rain, yet. Having the UA App, plus the constant updates from the Gate Agents, was comforting, especially as the delay extended.    One little oddity was how many seats were available on this flight. We had observed the same, the week before, when we flew United from PHX to LAX to SFO, and then SFO back to PHX. We fly this route monthly, and in some months, several times, and we are used to seeing most flight full, or very nearly so. I assume that being just after the New Year, and also the lousy weather on the California Coast, were likely contributing to the flights being only partially full - just uncommon to see so many available seats on these routes, on United.    Finally, boarding began at Gate 7, and we were in our seats. It was interesting, looking across the tarmac from T2 Gate 7, at the progress that was being made with T3. Delta was already operating at full schedule from that terminal, with United scheduled to move in, in early 2020.    We pushed back, and were on our way, after a glass of the Spumante for my wife, and a glass of the Fortant Cabernet Sauvignon for me, as our pre-departure beverage. During the brief flight, we had a passed snack basket, but as we had shared a Turkey Sandwich across from our gate, declined.    This ship, #3439, was showing a bit of wear-and-tear, as the seatback pocket’s elastic band had broken, and the carpet was showing some wear, as well.    We took off on Runway 25R, so had a nice view of Downtown Phoenix, before we entered into the heavy clouds. The short flight was smooth, and we just continued with the same wines for the next 1:25. We landed on Runway 28L, and were at Gate 64 (moved from Gate 74) in a few minutes.    Our luggage was out onto Carousel 2, which is some distance from the East Pier exit, down to baggage claim.    Our Gate Agents at PHX, and our cabin crew were excellent, and the flight smooth, albeit 2 hrs 18 mins late in arriving."
Dec 2019,40,Jan - UA1139 SFO to PHX 737-800 FC Seat 3A & B,"On Wednesday, January 09, we flew home to Phoenix (PHX) from meetings in San Francisco (SFO) on UA1139 on a 737-800 (#3248) in First Class, in Seats: 3A & B. Lately, leaving SFO, we have had some decent views of the Bay, and the Golden Gate Bridge, from the starboard side of the plane, but this trip had quite a few changes, so we booked a bit late, and only port side seats were available, and besides, the weather was lousy, so there were not going to be any good views to be had, from either side of the plane. On this flight, we took off toward San Francisco, on Runway 28L, but banked into the clouds and rain, before we had any views. We flew down the Coast, toward LA a bit longer, than normal, before vectoring more to the East - but with the clouds and weather, not much to see.    On the way to Gate 88 (originally scheduled for Gate 73), we took some time to explore the SFO Museum exhibit in the West Pier at T3, as it was new to us. We stopped into The San Francisco Giants Clubhouse restaurant, near our gate, for a late lunch, prior to boarding.    We boarded on-time, and even with the lousy weather, took off on-time, as well. We did not really get out of the clouds, until almost the CA/AZ State line, but had nice weather into PHX. Again, I was surprised at the number of vacant seats on this flight, though most were in Economy. We have become so used to most of our United flights being full, that to see so many empty seats on the seating chart is always a surprise - but then this was the afternoon flight to Phoenix.    This plane was from the Continental side of the fleet, with DirectTV, but the older style interiors. One nice feature about the newer interiors is the larger overhead bins, but my wife’s wheeled briefcase fit just fine, in the old, smaller bins. My briefcase fit under the seat, but with the DirectTV equipment, it was tight. On this flight, DirectTV worked fine, which has not always been the case in the past. It also had WiFi, for a charge, but we did not use that, so I cannot comment on its reliability, or speed.    I went with a red wine, and my wife the white, for the pre-departure beverage, and we declined the passed snack basket.    We arrived at PHX on-time, landing on Runway 7L, and were soon off to our home, with our luggage, which had arrived in a timely fashion, onto Carousel 4. We were going to have several days, before we had to pack for another business trip to San Francisco.    Our crew was very good, and did a nice job, on the short flight, and our Gate Agent at SFO was very good, and friendly too, but we had probably flown out of one of her gates a half-dozen times."
Dec 2019,40,Jan - UA708 Los Angeles to San Francisco 737-800 FC Seats 4A & B,"On Tuesday, January 08, we flew to San Francisco (SFO) from Los Angeles (LAX), on UA708, on a 737-800 (#3534), in First Class, Seats: 4A & B. This was the second leg of our Phoenix to LA to San Francisco flight, for a few days of meetings. Originally, we were to fly to SFO from Las Vegas (LAS), but meeting schedules got changed, and we had to go back to Phoenix, and then a day later, fly to SFO.    We had connected at LAX, for the necessary flight schedules, and headed to our gate, 74 in T7, just below the United Club, where we had spent our layover with wine and a Bloody Mary. One interesting sight was a United plane, just below the United Club, with the old Continental Airline “Blue Skyway” livery - circa about 1952. United has been adding retro livery schemes for some time now, and we enjoy seeing those, or flying on ships with the older livery.    We boarded on-time, for the short flight up the Coast to San Francisco. Unfortunately, the heavy clouds, which we had encountered just out of LAX had thickened even more, and were spitting rain. We love the flight up the Coast, but this time, there was essentially nothing to see, until about Palo Alto, and then not much, due to the weather. We had a good rain and low clouds/fog at SFO, but that did not affect our flight’s timing by more than a few minutes.    We took off on the same runway, on which we had landed, just a few hours before, 25R, and almost as soon as we cleared the Coast, we were into heavy clouds.    This 737-800 had the newer “Dreamliner” ceiling, and the improved/expanded overhead bins. My wife’s wheeled briefcase fit easily. The seats, which comfortable, are just not as good, in our opinion, as those in the refurbished AirBus A319/320 ships. Still, for domestic First Class, adequate, and especially for such a short flight.    This plane had free PDE (Personal Device Entertainment) via one’s tablet, but we did not use it on such a short flight. It also had WiFi (for a fee), but this also went unused.    We had a passed snack basket, but declined. It looked like most of the same items, that we see all too often.    All staff were great, from the Gate Agents at LAX, to the Global Services Staff, to the folk in the United Club, to our Flight Attendants - all just delightful.    Our luggage also arrived onto Carousel 8 in a very timely fashion, and we were soon on our way into San Francisco for the meetings."
Dec 2019,10,United Airlines incompetent and dishonest,"Plane stopped on runway due to malfunctioning de-icer and returned to gate-- we were deplaned. After progressively later departure times were given, suddenly the gate agent announced we had to go get our luggage from carousel 3 at baggage claim and then rebook on another flight. Meanwhile the app said our flight was delayed because of a late arrival! No, it was delayed for equipment malfunction.    The luggage never came, and waiting for it as instructed put me in the back of the line to change flights. The app and phone were no help bc no other united flights were available. The gate agent first booked me on a Delta flight but couldn't complete it bc it was an over-booked flight. Then she booked me on an American flight which had already been delayed past the connecting flight departure! Then she said ""I can't rebook you again-- we've already done it twice. It's American's problem now.""    Yes, she literally made two impossible bookings to punt my ticket to American! I had no options but to book the next day-- if they hadn't told us to wait at baggage claim when our luggage was behind the ticket counter, I could have gotten a flight. The American agent was very nice. I'll never book with United again."
Dec 2019,40,Jan - UA1278 Phoenix to Los Angeles A320 FC Seats 2E & F,"On Monday, January 07, we flew United Airlines UA1278 Phoenix (PHX) to Los Angeles (LAX) in First Class, Seat 2E & F on an Airbus A320 (#4257). This was the first leg of a quick business trip to San Francisco (SFO). We departed from PHX Gate 5, and arrived at LAX T8, Gate 86. We were connecting to SFO, from T7 Gate 74, but as our PHX to LAX flight was on-time, we had an easy connection, and had time for some wine at LAX. We were met by Global Services, who drove us over to the United Club in T7, to await our departure. We noticed that Global Services at LAX had gone to Mercedes M-Class SUV’s, where they once had Maybach S-600 Sedans. Originally, we were planning to fly from Las Vegas to San Francisco, but a meeting was added back in Phoenix, between the Las Vegas and San Francisco meetings, so plans had to change.    We started off the morning at the little United Club, across from Gate 7, in T2.    Oddly, this flight was only about 1/3 full, and that has been atypical for all of our previous flights to LAX.    We were on-time boarding and leaving PHX and arrived at LAX within 5 mins of the schedule. Our takeoff was on Runway 25R, so we did a little flyover of downtown Phoenix, before heading out over the desert, toward California.    The flight to LAX was uneventful, and we had decent weather for the entire flight, with just some haze and high clouds, until we were just outside of LA, where the cloud cover increased significantly, but before the clouds became too dense, we did catch snow on San Gorgonio Mountain, just south of Big Bear Lake.    We had PDE (Personal Device Entertainment), which is streaming content, sent to one’s device by the UA App. I did not bother on this short flight, so do not know how well it worked on this plane. This is free. There was also WiFi, for a fee, but we did not use that.    Some years ago, United did a major refurbish of the FC seating on their AirBus A319-320 ships, and we really like the seats now - probably even better, than on their newer 737-900's, though the latter do have larger overhead bins. On our A320, my wife’s wheeled briefcase fit easily, and my briefcase and hat fit nicely, below the seats.    In-flight, we had a passed snack basket.    Our landing was straight in on Runway 25R, which has been the usual approach, on several flights from PHX.    This was a very nice, albeit short flight, and the Gate Agents at PHX were excellent, as was our Flight Attendant in First Class."
Dec 2019,40,Great if You Have Status,"For my last business trip of the year I purchased a business class cross-country ticket with the price difference on my own dime. I was just tired of cross country travel and am not guaranteed an upgrade since the merger several years ago. It was a very good experience and I appreciate that United gives great customer service to its Gold members and higher. It's disappointing that all airlines don't just treat everyone well, but I'm still thankful. I'll definitely be a loyal United flyer until I stop business travel on its routes. We also had a recent TERRIBLE experience using my partner's American Airlines miles, so I am extra appreciative of how lovely it is to deal with United as a frequent flyer."
Dec 2019,50,Great flight! (NYC-Rome-NYC),"First time flying with United internationally and I have to say, the whole experience was very good! The ground staff were so helpful and easy to find, there was some confusion about my name in the boarding pass and it was sorted out very quickly. The boarding was quick, the flight took off on time, the food was very impressive. Only thing I can add is that the economy seats could have been more comfortable and wider, but apart from that, I have nothing but good stuff to say about the whole flight."
Dec 2019,10,Most frustrating seating experience ever,"I am SO ANGRY about the booking/seating process. There were $310 dollars in extra/hidden fees above and beyond the cost of my ticket that I ended up paying. There is NO indication when purchasing tickets that you will later have to spend extra money JUST TO SIT NEXT TO THE OTHER PERSON IN YOUR ORDER!!! By default, we were seated across the plane from one another in separate middle seats. I spend $250 to move us up one or several “classes” (of which there are about seven arbitrary classes you could be, each meant to bleed people dry a little more for three extra inches of legroom), just to sit next to my boyfriend, whose ticket I booked in the SAME ORDER, for all three legs of our trip. I also paid $60 for us each to check one bag each way. I originally booked United because the base cost was cheaper than Southwest (who I usually fly with), but by the end of the trip, it ended up being SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive, frustrating, and exhausting. At least on Southwest, and other airlines, I don’t feel heckled and cheated. I’m not separated from other party members and then forced to pay money to move back near them. Never ever will I fly United again. I’d rather pay more money for my ticket itself to not get screwed over later. What a slimy business practice."
Dec 2019,10,Left us.,"I have traveled with united 3 times in the past 6 months. 1-lost my luggage, 2-cancelled my flight and didn't offer to rebook, 3-overbooked my first flight causing me to miss the connection and stranding my partner and I in Chicago. Again, no effort to help rebook. Just left us."
Dec 2019,50,Wow,Hi I wanted to started out that on my 6flight from Anc to syd the staff was always supper helpful the checkin there was never no one and just went right through I tracked my bags it took less then 10minutes for them to be loaded on my flight  The gate agent were awesome When I was onboard I was shocked how clean it was and how the entertainment was awesome on the 787-10
Dec 2019,40,KUDOS to United !!!,"Due to circumstances beyond our control, our connecting flight to Washington Dulles was delayed and we missed this flight.  The tickets were economy - no changes/no refunds.  I cannot comment on the flight, seating, comfort, food, etc.    However - the customer service has been excellent!!!!!  Due to the circumstances of our previous delayed flight, United agreed to reimburse our Non-Refundable tickets for the three of us. Thank you, thank you!    Not so positives: Pay to choose your seat  Pay to check luggage"
Dec 2019,10,Very poor customer service and bad management,My wife and I planned a vacation in Cancun.  Unfortunately we had a situation with the family where she can't flight with me on the same day. We wanted to come back on the flight we booked with United.  They refused to help us and said if we do it that way they'll just cancel her flight reservation.  I think this would be my last time flying with United because they don't offer no help at all.
Dec 2019,40,North out of Mexico,"The Mexico check in and teminal the flight to Houston was fine and effiecent. The Houston terminal was a zoo as usual. The Gobal Entry was working and working well. United changed the gate at least once for our trip to Stl. Loading of the airplane was slow and not efficently run. The plane overly warm and hour on the tarmac before taking off, (such a way to run a railroad as they say in the old days ), poor."
Dec 2019,20,Poor in flight service,On time departure and arrival were the good parts. The in flight service was the minimum required and the cabin crew were much more interested in discussing and sorting out their private lives than serving the passengers.
Dec 2019,10,Worst Airline ever,"Would not hold a connecting flight 4 minutes for 9 passengers, lost days of vacation only to be rolled onto a flight that delayed 45 minutes to accommodate connecting flight passengers. They only care if the plane is full, not that you are on it."
Dec 2019,40,Holiday season 2019,First class service on United to New York was great. The flight attendant was awesome. Looked after the passengers needs throughout the flight. Will definitely be using this service again on my next trip.
Dec 2019,30,Nothing spectacular.,"United’s service seems reliable and in fact both the outbound and return flights arrived ahead of schedule. However, inflight service is quite minimal and it’s unfortunate that United charges for alcoholic drinks other than house beer and wine. I flew on a Basic Economy fare so my expectations were low. However, the gamble paid off and on the outbound the gate agent reassigned me from the pre-assigned middle seat to an aisle. On the return I got a window with an empty middle seat. United gets the job done."
Dec 2019,40,First Class Upgrade - But Not Service,"My flight departed Newark on Saturday, Dec 14th at about 7:30 pm. I received a complimentary upgrade to First Class on this flight but was somewhat disappointed with the service. Shouldn't complain since this was complimentary, but may help improve service. The fight attendant did not offer beverages before closing the door for departure, which is usually offered. The refreshing hot towel offered was a dry was cloth, nothing refreshing about that. The food was not very tasty, which is unusual, and I had to ask for wine with the meal since the attendant did not offer it. I believe this was simply just a bad day for the flight attendant and is not typical of the service I usually receive on United upgrades. I am a Gold Premier member, so I have quite a few flights to compare to and this was below par."
Dec 2019,20,Very bad experience,"Will NEVER fly United again!!  Had small carry on bags that fit in the carry on slot. They refused to let us on the plane until we paid for our small bags. Very upset and shocked. They were very rude and didn't care, even though their website clearly says you are allowed one carry on bag per person. Will never use this airline again.  Horrible experience!"
Dec 2019,50,Smooth flight to Orlando,My wife and I were very pleased with our recent United flight. We had not flown United much do to both cost and ontime performance. Our flight took off on time and we arrived 15-20 minutes early. It made for a nice start to our vacation.
Dec 2019,30,Seat back video was a waste of time.,"United has seat back video monitors, problem is they used Direct TV and service was not available through most of the flight, the only time we had consistant signal was as we came into Newark, NJ for our connecting flight. This was an issue because we had children and it would have been noce to have some entertainment for them. Luckily we had a computer they could play games on, however the outlets only go to the wing (row 21) so we did not have a way to chrage thr computer halfway through the flight. Ground staff at check in were very helpful grouping us so the adluts sat with the children through the flight. They did have the SToopwaffle cookie, one of the best cookies we have had as an in-flight snack."
Dec 2019,30,Average everything,"Compared to other carriers United is just OK. The food was unappealing, the seats less comfortable and the services in the air were below par. Still, we too off and landed on time so the purpose was achieved (but still find most other airlines better)"
Dec 2019,50,United Airlines was Great !!,We recently flew from Oklahoma City to Houston to Cancun on United Airlines. Flight was on time so we were able to make our connecting flight in Houston. Staff was very friendly and provided great service. We arrived a few minutes early in Cancun which started off a great birthday vacation week. Lots of choices for in-flight entertainment.
Dec 2019,10,Merry Christmas from hag-monster,I understand flying on Christmas but do you have to take out the fact that you have to work on people traveling. If they are this dismal on Christmas I don’t want to guess how nice United employers are on a daily basis. Will not be flying with this airline again. Old and rude counter people. Snooty and aggressive gate people. Terrible service.
Dec 2019,30,shrinking space and in flight service,"seats are uncomfortable, little cushioning, tiny leg room. No more pillows, blankets, entertainment services other than using your own cell phone."
Dec 2019,40,HORRIBLE!,"Flight took off on time and landed on time (about 9pm).....but then the problems started. There had been a freak snow storm come thru northern New Jersey just before which created significant delays on the ground....we sat on the tarmac for 3 hours, yes 3 hours waiting for a gate to open...then because several flights arrived at gates simultaneously, getting baggage took for ever......On the plane the flight crew passed out what food and water they did have....this was a NEWARK issue and not United's."
Dec 2019,10,Luggage Delays flight delays,"On the way to Houston over Amsterdam my luggage got lost. I had some expenses on the ground due to this and I am Still trying to get some money back but United told me the Claim Handling would take 6 weeks . On the wy back my flight from Houston to Newar was delayed . I asked Customer Service at United and they assured me that I would make my connection flight to Zuerich. Arrived in Newark my connection flight to Zuerich was gone and I got rebooked via London. This flight had another 2 hours delayed. I was not evene offered a meal nor to wait in the Lounge and overall I had a dely of more then 8 hours to arrive back in Zuerich .The whole flight with United was one of the most terrible experiences I had so far with Airline companies . Everything delayed no service , no help whatsoever."
Dec 2019,20,Not very good experience,"We fly to Cancun end of November,the seats in airplane very uncomfortable,hard and space is very tight,more suitable for teenager then adult, and i am not the big man.  The airplane don't look very clean,service and entertainment average. United start looking like lowcoster ,but price is not."
Dec 2019,10,Avoid At All Cost,"I’ve been flying internationally for nearly than 35 years, and by and large, I’ve been lucky in terms of delays and cancellations. However, in those few cases in which I’ve experienced significant issues, United Airlines has been a common theme, which is why I’ve largely avoided them over the past two decades.    I recently made the mistake of booking with United for a round-trip itinerary from Newark (EWR) to Muscat, Oman, for an adventure vacation. The relatively swift connections and competitive price were the siren song that lured me in.    Little did I expect that a dusting of snow at Newark Airport in December 18th would result in cancellation of our flight and an absolutely inept response from United. Although United cannot control the weather, it can control its response and contingency planning. Deploying only a handful of agents onsite to deal with dozens of cancelled flights is frugality at best, extreme negligence at worst. Elderly passengers and others were visibly confused by what to do next, and having to stand in line with up to a thousand other passengers, who were being handled by 3 or 4 agents, was clearly not an option for some.    Standing by the baggage carousel for 14 hours waiting for our bags — which had never left the plane that had never left the airport — was also beyond ridiculous. But what were we to do? We needed the bags in order to take an alternate vacation, seeing that our trip to Muscat was out of the question with a 2-day delay or longer. United did offer a $125 pp credit for the inconvenience of our bags being held hostage, but that cannot make up for the virus I came down with 48 hours after standing for a half a day in the frigid baggage claim, nor does it make up for the $1400 in miles I had to pay for an alternate trip on American for a consolation-prize itinerary to Tampa. But I felt compelled to pay American rather than deal further with United’s ineptitude, which was on full display within moments of our flight returning to the gate.    Clearly United has cut corners at Newark to the point where customer support and service are virtually nonexistent at certain times of the day and in certain contingencies. Not only does this make for miserable travel, but for some customers, in particularly the elderly or more vulnerable travelers, it can be hazardous.    Avoid United at all costs. Or, buyer beware."
Dec 2019,10,Stranded at Christmas,I am now on hold for an hour waiting for a supervisor. They canceled flights this morning and don't care if they ever get you out. Will never fly united again.
Dec 2019,10,Delays Galore,"Please avoid this airlines, never book a subcontractor, pay the few extra bucks. This airlines suck!!!!!!"
Dec 2019,20,"Unprofessional raised voices, rude and abrupt behavior by flight attendants","Mesa Airlines dba United Express.  I’ve been flying for over 30 yrs and have never ever heard staff speak so abruptly and condescendingly to people. Small plane and mostly sleeping passengers for a short flight after a long day of travel. A most unfortunate person had to go to the bathroom.... and over the loud speaker with a very raised and curt voice - a female flight attendant told her to sit down... several times. When the female flight attendant headed down the aisle for final check, the person who had been embarrassed by that attendant - said to her that she didn’t need to scream - she had heard her the first time. Shocker! The attendant raised her voice yet again! Me: sliding down in my seat witnessing the cringe-worthy exchange. Other passengers: heads down, eyes averted. I guess this stuff really does happen. It’s not a myth.    General rule of thumb: people behave badly because they have done so before without any consequences. Inside voices are always appreciated in confined spaces - shame on this company for allowing their employees to be so unprofessional. After it’s all said and done - people just want to arrive alive and carry on.  *I’ve never had a problem with United but Mesa is flying under United’s name. Now I have a problem."
Dec 2019,40,Never Deviates,Always the same right down to the snack - cheese and crackers or veggie wrap. I travel 6-8 trips a year United Business class. For years the snack is the same. The stewards are always friendly and professional. Seats vary in comfort.
Dec 2019,10,No TSA-Pre on boarding pass,Checked into my flight. Boarding pass does not show that I am eligible for TSA Precheck which is on my profile. Not the first time this has happened. Now have to call and deal with customer service.
Dec 2019,50,Surprisingly good !!,"I was skeptical about taking UA to Germany but I was pleasantly surprised by how courteous the staff was. Although, we were 85 mins late, and I did miss my connection to Istanbul, I was upgraded to business class on Turkish. Loved the food and the entertainment on UA. All in all excellent experience."
Dec 2019,40,"First time with United, probably not the last.","Can't say anything negative about United, it's cabin crew or the flight. Only really picky thing is the IFE, very difficult to hear with the provided earphones, guess it's fine if you have your own. Massive choice of films, more limited for music.  Food wasn't great, but wasn't bad either."
Dec 2019,40,Houston IAH - Narita NRT in Business Class,"We flew from Houston IAH to Narita NRT in United Polaris Class. The seats were not Polaris seats on this flight. The flight departed at 10 am. We were coming from Central America and landed at 5 am so we did use the Polaris Lounge at IAH. The breakfast offerings there were just OK - nothing very fancy. The usual eggs, waffles, fruit. But they did make me a cappuccino with a snowman.    The flight from IAH to NRT was pretty full - we flew on December 23. Took the Japanese option for dinner. For the pre arrival service, I also took the Japanese option of Katsu Chicken. Mid flight, tried the chicken rice bowl. The food is OK. It is nothing like what ANA offers on their Houston to Narita flight. But it is still better than the western option.    Polaris class offered pajamas and slippers and all the usual 2 blanks and 2 pillows. I love their slippers and the gel pillow.    We landed in Narita at 2:45 pm - 30 minutes before schedule. We had to go through immigration which was fairly quick - fingerprints and photo was taken. We were connecting to Fukuoka and had to go to Baggage Claim to retrieve our bag and then check it in with the ANA agent. Then we headed to the ANA arrival lounge."
Dec 2019,40,Salvador SAL to Houston IAH Business Class,"After a disaster with Avianca trying to fly from San Salvador SAL to Japan, we were re-booked on United through Houston IAH. Check in at the SAL airport was quick. We were flying Business Class and there was no line. We had checked in online on the UA app. The UA app will show you Baggage Status - i.e. it was checked in and whether it was loaded on the plane. This is very useful information.    At the gate in SAL, there is added security where they search your bag and give you a pat down.    Our flight was at 1:55 am with a 5 am arriving in IAH. We arrived a few minutes early and had to wait until we deplaned because immigration in IAH doesn't open until 5. Food is served on the plane because we were in Business Class but because this flight leaves at 2 pm, I just slept the entire time.    Upon arrival at IAH, you do not need to retrieve your bag at baggage claim if you are connecting to ANOTHER international flight. If you connect to another domestic flight, you do need to reclaim your bag."
Dec 2019,40,Service was good.,"Paying the little extra to and from with no stops was a great way to travel. On the way to Jamaica, we had movies we could watch and on the way back we did not. But with no stops and no hassles to and from the airport it was a great way to go. I believe the attendants have a hard time providing services to those that do not drink while traveling."
Dec 2019,20,The Squeeze,"United has reduced economy seats to a degree that makes any length flight a miserable experience. We were on a newly outfitted 737 on this flight and the decided for the short duration we would save a few bucks by staying in the least expensive seats. After all we were going to be in ""Economy Plus"" on the second leg of the trip, so we could deal with some tightness for a while. The seats were so close to the seat in front of us I could not sit straight because my knees were jammed against the seat in front of me. Unless you are a very small person I do not recommend flying United's economy. So far Southwest has not done this to their seats. I would much rather be on one if their planes for the same or less cost. United wants you to upgrade to premium economy or better, so it seems making you as uncomfortable as possible in economy is their goal. I for one will not play their game. I will fly another airline rather than pay extra for what should be a minimum standard seat."
Dec 2019,50,Everything perfect,"After a lot of negative united reports should be a good one. Flight arrives 30 minutes early, service on board good. Food was ok, wine quality very good. Entertainment system ok. Compared to other asian airlines same quality. Very good space for sleeping overnight.  All in all, very good flight, everything better as expected. Thanks united, great job done!!"
Dec 2019,20,Smooth Ride Going,The return trip was rough. But what bothered me was that the flight attendants from Dulles Washington DC chooses to ignore that the person sitting in the middle had a large backpack that didn’t fit under the seat in front of her so the backpack was placed at the bottom of her feet blocking the row. Three flight attendants passed bye and each took note but said nothing. I felt unsafe since I had a window seat.
Dec 2019,10,Horrible Lounge,"Traveling with 3 kids we walked to get to our gate and enter the lounge . After all the walking we were told that lounge is for long haul travelers and that we needed to walk back away from our gate to another lounge . We did so and experienced a lounge that was busy , no place to sit and in poor condition"
Dec 2019,10,United Airlines Helped Ruin My Christmas,"I bought a round trip with United Airlines. I missed my first flight and booked another flight. Apparently if you don't let them know within 48 hours that you plan on keeping your return trip, they will cancel it and take your money without any notification or heads up. I used to think United Airlines was quality, but they are actually on the same level as Spirit Airlines."
Dec 2019,30,Delayed. Delayed. Delayed!,No premium service on flight do to Captain grounding crew based on flight conditions during flight. Who needs a drink after midnight anyway? I do. That is why I paid to sit up front for the amenities and leg room.
Dec 2019,10,Don't,Every single flight was a catastrophe! We were stuck in the airplane in SFO cause the airport staff used a different bridge and no one knew how to operate that one. So they had to contact a trainer to come and help them. Until he was finally there and helped with the bridge 1 hour has passed. 1 hour of everyone waiting in the freaking hot airplane (captain had turned off engine already so no more ac). A lot of us had a connecting flight 20 min later. The boarding for my next flight was delayed. On the way back we couldn't board for 45 min because the catering boxes were still missing in the plane. Once we were boarded we had to wait about 30 min in the airplane at the gate because apparently now there was one catering box too much and they had to get rid of one. Next flight was the same because cargo doors couldn't be closed. Boarding 30 min delayed. Staff rude and unhelpful. Never again. That was just riddicoulos.
Dec 2019,10,Lost luggage nightmare,"UAs lost baggage system is horrendous. Bad online app, agents have no idea what is going on, door to door transfer service inept. Was flat out told by an agent in SFO that our itinerary and layover would have never guaranteed our luggage would have made a second flight despite being offered by UA. Agent in SFO did not give us both the claim numbers we needed. When texted to call back to UA baggage, the hold times were longer than stated and the agent told us, after giving us info, not to call again but use the app. The app appears to only have two statuses: looking and transfer to delivery. You are then pretty much in the hands of “FINDMYSUITCASE.COM”. Went onto site, and only 1 suitcase was showing to be delivered. Reached out to UA on twitter and was told no, both were going to be delivered.    Surprise! Only one came this am. I am still trying to find my husband’s luggage to no avail.    I have had lost luggage on Southwest, Continental before and never had to jump through so many hoops and deal with so many agents that seem unwilling to provide any professional customer service."
Dec 2019,20,"Don fly United if you can help it, especially international.","The actual flight was fine, we got there and got back, however, our gates were changed twice, once without any notification at all. Flying back into the country you have to pick up your luggage and recheck it, the process is very passenger unfriendly and unnecessary. Flying into Newark NJ airport to get to our connecting flight was a very big headache. We had to go back through security, the security staff as well as united staff was less than welcoming and friendly. Even though we had a 2.5 hour layover, we almost missed our flight home because of the lack of helpfulness and the exhaustive security process. I will not fly united, nor will I fly into newark if I can help it."
Dec 2019,20,United Basic Economy,"The flight going to Las Vegas was poor. They ran out of room in the overhead and had to check peoples carry on bags, the leg room was tight, there was no TV or on board entertainment to pass the time, We left late from the airport. Overall it was a very bad experience.I do have Elite status and priority boarding with United."
Dec 2019,40,One way on United back on Delta for cost savings,Travelling for Thanksgiving out of Chicago always leads to congestion and crowds at check in and security. However flying First Class made the check in process smooth and quick. The place we were on had the new United Livery and it looked clean and nice.    The cabin was one of the nicest I have seen on a domestic product (A319) I wish United had these seats on all of their domestic planes. Breakfast was hot and good and service was surprisingly nice and fast.    The trip flew by. I would recommend United over American .
Dec 2019,30,So so expierence,"Why you can't check bags at curbside check in for International flights I'll never understand. No problem when we flew American. The flight there was decent with a upgraded plane and good entertainment choices, but the return flight was an older plane with NO entertainment choices because of not having any tv screens on the plane. Two issues that keep their rating mediocre. Though both flights were on time or slightly ahead of schedule."
Dec 2019,30,Did Not Get First Class Service,"Even though the flight attendants were very friendly and attentive, the rest of what is offered is not what we paid for. On the first leg, my wife’s special meal was not on board and the electrical outlets did not work. On the second leg, our confirmation stated dinner but we received a bag of potato chips and nuts. The electrical outlet was so worn out that the plug would not stay in. On both legs, the seats are worn and uncomfortable and no pillows were offered."
Dec 2019,10,Multiple Delayed Flights,"We had to board our flight, sit there for 30 minutes while the plane went in circles on the runway. Then they told us to deboard because of a maintenance issue. 1 hour later, we board and arrive at our layover. Everyone missed their connecting flights and we had to stay an extra night in a smoking hotel. We had missed already one day of our vacation, which was $1,000 for one night in the resort. Next day we arrive at the airport just to be informed our flight was delayed again. Basically, delayed flight caused us to miss connecting flight missing our hotel day and next day same flight, delayed"
Dec 2019,50,Pleasant Experience,"Pleasant travels on United to Maui. Premium Economy was surprisingly very comfortable and good food. As a very frequent flyer, I was very happy with my journey on United. Overall flights where on time."
Dec 2019,20,Basic Economy sours the spirit towards United,I was awakened at one am with an animated call- my nephew and his girlfriend were stranded at check-in in Seattle because they didn’t have cash or credit card to pay for one checked bag. They are living hand to mouth and my sister had bought them the tickets to come for Christmas. I was able to check them in online. But I’m left with a very sour feeling towards United-esp this Basic option. I really dislike this system of forcing people to pay for even one carry on. United has squeezed and squeezed the consumer and its time to fight back. I flew Delta this time and loved the flight. No baggage fee for carry on. Polite and helpful crew. United is continuing a sort of unpopular debasement of the least wealthy consumer and United -I hope you’re listening. The Basic tickets is bad business and should go.
Dec 2019,20,Pathetic Houston (IAH) baggage staff,"Flight was good other than this incident. We had 3 check in bags. With the first weighing 45 pounds, next one weighing 48 pounds and last one weighing 55 pounds. Such an irritating lady that she passed the first two bags seperately on the stroller and then told us that the last one was heavier by 5 pounds."
Dec 2019,10,Never travel united airlines with a pet,"We traveled for the first time with UA from Seattle to Zurich, via SFO as there is no direct flights available. Already the check-in experience was terrible. With a pet in cabine, you can never take advantage of the online check-in, so we arrived early at the airport and it has taken them forever to check-us in. It was like the first time they had anyone traveling with a pet, and so they called their own hotline talk to them if it's even possible etc. even though we had a receipt confirming that we even paid the fee ahead of time. But then in SFO when we boarded the next flight, the gate crew said they don't see that we paid the pet in cabine fee and that we have to pay again. So we paid double, now customer services don't want to assist at all and give us the run around. I mean in the end it's really just 125 USD and at the gate in SFO the price was 126 USD, so are we really going to take legal action? I don't think so, but do airline really ignore CLV over 125USD? I guess so."
Dec 2019,40,The Treat of Comfort by Friendly Flight Attendants,It is a quite comfortable flight for 6 hours. The seats are comfortable and the service is good. The audio+visio functions and the service of internet might be upgraded for the better satisfaction of passengers. The food and beverages are also good. Some organic food and bio beverages might also be added to the menu.
Dec 2019,50,Awesome flight experience,"I flew from Los Angeles to Tokyo in united airlines, I got upgraded to first class and that was the best way to start my trip to Japan.  When o got to my lie flat seat I had pillows and blankets from saks and a really nice Star Wars amenities kit waiting for me.  The food was great and tasted really well, the dinner had nice touches for example the salt and pepper looked like the united logo.  After the dinner was over I slept for almost six hours on the lie flat seat that helped me to diminish the jet lag.  The entertainment system was nice and had a ton of movies and series from 2019.  Overall was a great experience and the cabin crew was super nice."
Dec 2019,10,Horrible experience,"Awful experience. The trip with the horrible food from Bogotá had already begun badly. But never I imagined what expect me in the return flight. They delayed our flight supposedly because there were problems in El Dorado. That delay put us in the middle of a rain with some ice. Attention: RAIN not a snowfall. With this excuse we had to wait three hours on the track; so the plane had to be evacuated and the crew exceeded their working time. They never gave us verbal and ground explanations, they forced us through misleading, incomplete and found information to make a line of more than 6 hours. Without discriminating children and elderly persons. They do not offer any compensation, neither a cup of coffee in an airport with all stores closed after 11 pm. The worst experience of my life with air tickets that exceeded 1000 dollars."
Dec 2019,10,Delayed flight for over 8 hours,"On June 16, 2019 we had the first flight out of Sioux Falls which was to leave at 605 am. We checked out flight status at 4 am when we woke up. The flight was on time. We get to the airport at 450 am and check in our luggage only to be told that the flight has been delayed until 10 am. We could not get on the next flight out as it was booked. We were to leave at 1145 am. At 11 am we were told the flight was going to be at 245 pm as the flight crew had to have 8 solid hours of rest,  Sometime around 400 the fire alarm went off at the hotel the crew was staying at. The 8 hour clock started over. No discounts, no help in getting a different flight. We were stuck waiting. We barely made the connecting flight in Denver. We did not get into Calgary until 905 pm. We had to spend the night in Calgary at our own expense and missed a night at our resort. Thank you United for making us miss a day of vacation. I called and talked to United customer service and still no compensation."
Dec 2019,50,Good seats and some food,"We went from New York on a snowy day, but the flight was only 45 minutes delayed . Lots of cancellations. We got tea, coffe and sid for free plus some snacks. Plenty of space for legs."
Dec 2019,20,Misinformed,"In purchasing it tell u seats only assigned at check in at airport; on this type of ticket ..but then I kept getting request to purchase seats ; so I thought oh no .. I looked at the diagram of seats ... not manny so I worried if I did not now purchase seats I may not have one... so for 2 of us I spent quite a bit of additional $... bumping my cheap ticket to now a kinda regular ticket which was the very back of plane last row to be exact!!  Point is had I not purchased these 2 last row seats on each flight , I may have had a better seat with no extra fee.... a waste of my money"
Dec 2019,40,Direct flight to PR.,"Easy direct flight to San Juan, good time to leave and come back in the evening.  Reasonable prices with checked bags."
Dec 2019,50,Holiday flights,"I have to say that United Airlines were superb from start to finish in both outward bound and return flights. We did experience a problem with our screen on the way out to the USA, but the crew tried everything to get the screen up & running but to no avail. They did however compensate us for the inconvenience unprompted I may say. The food and drinks offered were more than acceptable to us both. The return flight was just as good with the level of service and food in offer.  I have flown many airlines and to many destinations but United Airlines I have to say was one of the best airlines we have used on our travels and with that I would definitely recommend."
Dec 2019,40,"Not as friendly service as in the past, with some exceptions","We’ve always had wonderful, friendly service on our flights to and from Tokyo in the past. This trip was a bit of an exception. On both flights, with the exception of one flight attendant on both, the friendliness seems to have diminished. In fact, on the flight from Newark to Tokyo, the best flight attendant in business class was one person, Tina, who was actually working coach but helping out in business, who was super. And on the way back, one of the flight attendants recognized my husband and was great. He also was very friendly. But the others not so much...helpful but no smiles. The food was ok and the comfort was great, and most important, safe flights."
Dec 2019,50,Great flight to and from Las Vagas!,The United flight to and from Las Vegas was great! Most likely because we upgraded our seats to Economy Plus which give you 5 additional inches. Those 5 inches make a very big difference in comfort. Definitely would recommend upgrading to Economy Plus when you can.
Dec 2019,10,Nurse,I purchased a round trip ticket flying from Newark international airport on Spirit airplane to fortlauderdale Florida. My flight had several cancellations due to bad weather conditions. My return was supposed to be from fortlauderdale Florida on United Airlines well I never made it to Florida. Spirit airlines refunded my money back because they couldn’t get me to Florida but United Airlines refused to refund my money back. No good business they do not value there customers. Be very careful purchasing tickets through this Airline god forbid if you don’t make it to your destination they don’t care they will rip you off. Choose another Airline they are more willing to be fair. Beware
Dec 2019,50,Excellent,A great business class flight from LA to LHR - the seat/lay flat bed was really comfortable. The amenities pack they gave us was Star Wars branded and had lots of little things inside - a great keepsake.    The staff were all fantastic and the food choices were great .
Dec 2019,10,Say that this Airline is ridiculous would be giving them to much credit.,"I showed up and arrived at the airport 3 hours early I grabbed a bit to eat, walked around and approximately 1 hour and a half before boarding I checked in and the automatic boarding pass station would not let me board. So I immediately walked over to an agent and there were a few people in line so I patiently waited my turn. I explained to the attendant what had happened at the kiosk and he told me the the board had closed. I w asked what do you mean closed he said sorry it closed. I said so boarding closed 1.5 hours before the flight he said yes. I told him I fly all over the world and that he was "" full of sh*t."" He spoke to me in Spanish accent and the was a language barrier. I immediately asked to speak to a supervisor they said he was available, with out getting on the phone to see or not. 2 mins later two Miami Dade police officers approached me one in the front and one in the rear I then began to speak with the officer. It just so happens that the officer was employed at a local Texas Police department from close to my home town where I am a peace officer. I told the officer I can not believe he agent called him for telling him he was ""full of sh*t."" We both kinda chuckled and the supervisor finally came about 20-25 mins later. Long story short be aware of flying United Airlines, like I stated I have flown all over the world with various airlines and have never I experienced anything like this, not even at airports or airlines in out countries. This is ridiculous at best and I will never fly United EVERY AGAIN!!!!!!!!"
Dec 2019,10,Flights were delayed,This is my second time when my flight got delayed for more than 4-6h. The worst part of it is that they say that the plane will depart and they do not give any other options. They just say we have to wait and chill out. They provoke you and smile at your face. The worst company ever. They said they will give me a $50 e-vaucer for my first delayed flight which actually did not happen. Good luck flying with them.
Dec 2019,40,MEM to LAX,"On Labor Day, I flew from Memphis to Los Angles with a connection in Houston. Check-in was easy, the Gate Agents were professional, and the flight crews were friendly and delightful."
Dec 2019,10,Wild unprofessionalism & incompetence,"Customer mistreatment, inexplicable delays, tarmac-siting, zero compensation. Travelers are completely at the mercy of the company's incompetence. A total nightmare every time. Never again."
Dec 2019,20,Impolitely delay,"We flew from New York to Tampa on the 18th December we had a 3 hours delay and they just offered us a biscuit complimentary on the plane.we had to sit and wait inside the aircraft more than 1,5 hours.I will avoid at all cost using United airlines and I don’t recommend to anyone"
Dec 2019,50,This was a good flight. About the right balance,This was a good flight. About the right balance between attentiveness and privacy. I do acknowledge that some of the international carriers do provide a more professional service than United airlines but as a frequent traveler this was definitely a good experience.
Dec 2019,40,Premium Economy,"Coming back from Asia on this final international trip of the year, I got to experience Premium Economy.    Boarding was no different in Group 1. Seating arrangement was 2-4-2 so one less than regular economy. Overall the seat was wider, greater recline and foot rest. Bigger LCD screen with nicer over the ear headphones. The small amenity pouch had the Star Wars theme and included socks, eye cover, toothbrush . Saks Fifth Avenue blanket and pillow were also part of the upgraded amenities. Lastly, there were lots of storage in the seat along with USB and outlet power (remember to lift the arm rest to avoid contotring yourself to get at those plugs). .    Food service was a bit nicer with the food served on something other than plastic. However, they quickly ran out of the fish option and offered the economy pasta instead. The second service also ran out of options so i really do not understand how they allocate their meals. This was the most disappointing aspect.    I did not get to sleep much on the flight back to the US as I was catching up on movies. It was more comfortable than economy plus with the extra room and for just a couple hundred more than economy fares I will look to upgrade again."
Dec 2019,40,Best of a bad situation,"The plane ride to Newark, our stop before the Ottawa connection, was terrific. The staff were so accommodating and polite, food wasn't bad for airplane food, we got to watch fairly recent movies, and all in all it was a terrific flight. The mar in the entire trip back was our experience in Newark. We were only supposed to have a 5-hour layover, but the flight kept getting delayed...and delayed. After hours in that awful airport, we were told it had been cancelled (at 10 p.m.). But United put us up in hotels, although we only we got about 4 hours' sleep, got to the airport in the wee hours...only to experience delays all morning until we were certain the flight would be cancelled again. Luckily, we took off after 12:30 p.m. Staff couldn't tell us much. But customer service after the fact tried to make it up to us."
Dec 2019,50,Great flight!,My trip was to Belize and my first stop was Houston. I was worried that we might be delayed and miss our connecting flight. This flight was fantastic and arrived so early that we were able to stop for snacks before boarding the next flight to Belize. I was absolutely impressed!!
Dec 2019,10,UNITED NEEDS TO COMPENSATE GUESTS,United needs to compensate their guests with either an airline ticket or miles! No compensation for their mistakes is UNACCEPTABLE!!!
Dec 2019,10,UNITED NEVER FAILS TO FAIL!,"When your NEGATIVE reviews are 8000 and your positives are 10,000,YOU kkkknow you must be providing the GREATEST customer services available.I tell ya, United never fails to ssssuck! My flight was delayed TWICE. The last time I had to spend 11 hours in the airport due to a delay WITHOUT ANY FORM OF COMPENSATION! Their fault mind you."
Dec 2019,10,Worst Delay,Weather was clear and all was listed as on time. Boarded at 6:20 for a 7:00pm takeoff. After sitting on the plan for over an hour they then announce they are waiting on catering and it should only be 15 min. Af 8:02 they finally announce they have what they need! Disgraceful. They over charge for the seats because of the time of year but are not held responsible for their own inept service. Fly Jet Blue or anyone else!    Disgusted customer
Dec 2019,10,Lame excuses,"United is proven that there is always a way to go lower! After flying over 1,000,000 miles with them I have to say I do all I can to avoid doing business with this company.  Their flights became a miss or hit, in the last couple of years. Broken Planes is a new normal. “Your Safety is our priority”.. BS. If I get a $1 every time I hear that I could by my our private jet by now!    But today they top all off! Flight from Newark to Brazil, 3 hours delayed. The excuse is that they could not get the plane from terminal B to terminal C - in Newark!! Once that finally got the plane to the gate...ooops we have to clean it (airplane arrived 5 hours ago from China).  Great Planing! I guess it’s officially amateur time for United!  Even the captain said this is bizarre and has no excuses.    Come on United! Get your act together!    #unfriendlyskys"
Dec 2019,10,Terrible waiting time for bag check in,We bought business class tickets and waited in the line to check out bags in for 1.5 hours. Terrible!
Dec 2019,10,United Air lines is DOO-DOO,"The flight got canceled 3 times, everything was in chaos and we had to wait for another flight to take off even though we were supposed to go way before them."
Dec 2019,10,Worst airline ever,"Worts airline I’ve ever seen. I have flown United about 4 times last month, never on time. In addition to the usual problems in Newark, the staff seems unprepared and unable to react to complex situations. This not to mention they are rude. In short, this is a low cost at regular price. By the way, I am silver client... no choice."
Dec 2019,20,Non stop is nice but that's about it,The food was inedible. I got the vegitarian to keep it simple. They can't even do rice with vegitables. The rice crunches and the vegitables were soggy. There is no TV screen on a six hour flight and their entertainment system isn't compatible with Chromebook. Also no lie flat seat. The internet was okay but no streaming. They served pretzle bread which was nice but no mustard. Who eats pretzel bread without mustard ?
Dec 2019,40,A bit annoying,A bit annoying. Our boarding time was delayed and when we were finally told to board and everyone was on board our captain told us our plane had critical navigation issues and troubleshooting was being done. We sat on the place for almost an hour and they even shut down the plane totally and rebooted everything! I feel we should not have been made to board if there were issues and should have been allowed to wait at the gate until the issues were resolved. All we were offered in the hour and a half we sat on the plane was water.
Dec 2019,30,Jumping the Pond East-West,"United Flight UA8903 Code share with Lufthansa. Class of service is not what it cracked up to be as compared to Cathay Pacific or China Southern. Only divided by a curtain as compared to either Cathay Pacific or China Southern, class of service is divided by a solid wall. My seat selection were reassigned although I pre-selected. Check in counter staffs were not friendly and as attentive. Boarding is in the general boarding group as compared to competitor airlines. My lounge coupon was not accepted. My loyalty to the brand is in questioned."
Dec 2019,30,Long flight no food,"We flew from Seattle Costa Rica with a lay over in Dallas. We've flown many international flights and were able to check one bag. Not with United, $30 for checked bag. 4 hour and 3 hours for second leg and got a cookie. Everything else you pay. Can't wait for the return flight."
Dec 2019,20,No space for carry on luggage,"The flight was on time and check in went smoothly. But one problem we encountered was that there was no carry on luggage space in the cabin and there was no leg room. Way too crammed in a small space. The flight time was 45 minutes and it was manageable, but can’t imagine any longer flight in that space, full of passengers."
Dec 2019,20,Worst flight ever,I got on the plane and it was smoking hot I mean we where all dieing on the flight. Then we heard that some of the luggage’s where going to be in LA and when we got to aspen I did not have my bag for the whole trip I would not recommend United at all trust me
Dec 2019,30,On-Time Despite Inclement Weather,"Despite a snowstorm the day/night before, we surprisingly encountered no delays on a 6:30 am flight. It was still snowing lightly as we left. Pleasant male attendants. Courteous and smiling. Smooth flight despite warnings from captain that we could encounter turbulence. It's always nice getting to your vacation destination on time! (We tried getting cheaper flights with other airlines but always seem to come back to United. Overall, a pretty good airline as airlines go!). Hate paying the 30.00 for each of our checked bags. Next time, it's a carry-on only."
Dec 2019,10,A Coffin in the Sky,"Omg where do I begin? The plane was old, filthy and the air filters had most likely never been replaced. I don't particularly take issue with the fact that their aircraft is dated, however the poor maintenance is astounding. I had to ask a flight attendant for a mask because the strong smell of urine, mold and mildew was just so overwhelming. The flight was also an hour late landing. If I didn't have a 2 hour layover to my final destination I would have been screwed."
Dec 2019,40,Great flight Lousy return.,"Flight in Polaris was one of the best. Great comfortable seats, very nice and professional, albeit a bit slow service. On time departure and arrival. A bit of a rough landing in Paris. All in all one of the best flights with United.  Unfortunately I cannot say the same thing for the return. 6 hours before departure (I was 200miles away and just about to leave my hotel (at 5.30 AM) my return flight was canceled w/o explanation and rebooking. 0n my way to Frankfort I was able to get 2 seats in Business on Lufthansa.Plane was an old 747-8 with very old business class seats, smallish and uncomfortable. Am quite upset since I shelled out 2 times full fare for Polaris, not miles or company paid ticket, CASH."
Dec 2019,10,Terrible Accommodations,Cancelled our flight 5 times and then rescheduled us on more flights that ended up getting delayed. Lives up to its garbage name.
Dec 2019,30,Overcrowding,Recently flew from houston to managua and the plane had every seat booked. And the luggage was everywhere you should not be able to carry on large bags.    On a positive note i would highly recommend the priority security gate clearance and boarding fee its well worth the money not having to stand in line for the TSA checks
Dec 2019,50,Puerto Rico 2019,"The flight attendants were attentive. Flight was delayed and the crew were always giving us an update and helped out the other passengers with a tight connection by announcing to give those passengers priority in getting off the plane. Bag was damaged and when I arrived in Newark, the customer service representative was very responsive and after assessing the bag, it was replaced on the spot in less than 20 minutes."
Dec 2019,40,2.5 hour weather delay in Newark,"The weather was perfect in Austin, but not in landing city of Newark. Delayed 3 times with great communication and after 2nd delay free snacks and water. Not much but they did not have to do it. I doubt that would have happened in Newark.But, you never know. Baggage took 45 minutes after landing which was a bit too long for me.  The weather delay was not the airlines fault. Keeping us safe is most important."
Dec 2019,40,Comfortable and Friendly,"Pleasant flight attendants, comfortable seating, descent meals, good entertainment. The only thing I think United could do better is have their planes a little cleaner. On time departure, on time arrivals, overall very pleasant air travel."
Dec 2019,50,pleasant flight,"Staff was friendly but not overly friendly. The pilot made it a smooth flight. I recommend downloading the United app and watching a movie on your device, i watched Stuber which was hilarious."
Dec 2019,20,A Nightmare Before Christmas,"This relates to flight UA960 on 12/19 out of Newark. Last night as we were about to embark on a holiday journey to reunite with our family that we only get a chance to see once or twice a year. Our flight was at first delayed by an hour - typical, but manageable as we had about 2 hours to connect in Frankfurt to our final destination; Beirut. And then as it often happens with United, the closer we got to our revised departure time, the more delay notices we got. Upon the 3rd one, it was clear we would never make our connection. We then called the support line and a very helpful representative assisted us, looking for viable options. Unfortunately, nothing was available. Reluctantly, we had to re-book our entire trip, departing on 12/22 instead of 12/19. Now we’ve spent 5 hours waiting in vain at Terminal C, burnt $120 in taxi fares, and $150 on a sub-par airport dining experience. But, more importantly, we find ourselves with a flight to Beirut that has me waiting 11 HOURS in Frankfurt (the most uninteresting city in all of Germany). We land late at night on Christmas Eve and will miss on all of the holiday cheer that we normally partake with our families as we prepare for Christmas Day. I will be tired, sad and stressed out because you are doing a very poor job of running this company."
Dec 2019,40,Smooth-no issues,We flew the red-eye from Denver to Newark and then on to Aruba. No issues at all.  Very nice flights. On the flights home there were delays and the Agent at the counter re-routed us so we would make all connections and still arrive home at a decent time.  Thank you!
Dec 2019,30,Two-Hour Delay,"We flew First Class on an Embraer ERJ 175, a regional jet, between Tucson and San Francisco on a weekday morning. Soon after arriving at the Tucson airport, we learned there would be an indefinite delay due to weather conditions in San Francisco. I was actually rather relieved because I could use the extra time on the ground to arrange for repair work to our roof. It had started to leak into our kitchen when a thunderstorm hit just as a taxi arrived to take us to the airport. As I sat making calls, text messages from United kept me updated on the delay status. One was too vague to be helpful, indicating only that the delay would be shorter than originally expected. A time would have been useful to know.    The delay lasted about two hours. Boarding went smoothly with many passengers leaving their carryons at the door to go into the hold because of limited overhead storage space in regional jets. Their luggage would be delivered to them on the jetway in San Francisco.    We sat in the plane’s second row and found the seats to be somewhat small but comfortable for the 2-hour flight. The cabin was clean and well maintained. Our flight attendant was professional, pleasant and customer-oriented. She offered a drink service and came around with a basket of sweet and savory items, inviting passengers to choose something. The flight was quite smooth and the pilot gave useful updates.    Our next flight that day would be to Europe, but even with the delay, we had built in a time cushion to easily make the connection in San Francisco, based on past experience."
Dec 2019,20,Changed flights again !!,I've flown with United airlines a few times mostly long haul flights from US to USA or other way around..twice United airways have altered my flight plan..  I'd booked to intentionally fly to Houston from Sydney so that I didnt have to go through the scramble at LAX but the airline changed my plans without even telling me so that I was on an LAX flight then connect to Houston..now I've found that my flight to Las Vegas which was meant to go via LAX there then San Francisco with an 8 hour lay over coming back has now changes without reason or without contacting me.. to become a flight to LV via san Fran and back through LAX with 9 hour lay over !! I didnt want to go to LA !  All I'm saying is be mindful that United has a habit of changing your plans without contacting you..and when you do contact them they palm you off to other sites ... not happy about this
Dec 2019,20,$480 one way + $30 for a bag no snack,"What once was ""the friendly sky"" is now old, expensive and very Un friendly crew, flew United LAX to OGG (Maui) paid $480 one way for each of us + $30 per checked in bag, about 6 hours flight and other than doing and a cookie nothing !  The flight attendees looked liked they hated doing the job (older ladies in their 50's) it may be hard so just quit and go do something else, it's not easy for us passengers / sardines to seat for 6 hours we don't need your attitude too!  Also, boing 737-800 had good comfortable seats but entertainment system from the 80's - what's up with that united?  I fly quite a bit, taking into consideration the leg space that is getting smaller and smaller, so many flight delays and all the extra charges for bags, food ..... The one thing that can make us feel a little less miserable is a smile and good service from the crew but :-("
Dec 2019,50,5 STAR FOR THE GATE AGENT ALONE,"We flew United 1798 from SFO – SAN on 12/18 on a 737-800SFP, and if not for the work of gate agent Douglas Gutierrez, it would have been lower rated. We had made reservations for this flight in October, but upon arrival in Frankfurt prior to departing for SFO I checked the United APP and found out that, my wife and I had been split up on this flight. Instead of seats 2E and 2F, we were now in 2E and 3A. Upon arrival in SFO, I checked with the United lounge attendant and she said she could not do anything, as the flight was full. So, when we arrived at the gate I talked to Douglas about our situation and he said he would try to work some magic. The boarding was delayed due to a late inbound and prior to us boarding I was called to the gate desk and handed new boarding passes for our original seats. Thank you Douglas. Even with the late takeoff, we landed early in SAN. Nothing stood out on the flight except the customer service of the gate agent. If all United personnel were as professional and customer service oriented as Douglas Gutierrez, United would be a 10 star airline."
Dec 2019,50,EXCELLENT INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT,"We flew United flight 59 on 12/18 from FRA – SFO onboard a 777-300. Boarding was started on time and were offered a pre-departure drink from a wide variety of drinks. Pushed back at 1257 and wheels up at 1314 versus a 1250 schedule. About an hour into the flight drinks and warm nuts were served, then the appetizer about 15 minutes after that. The entrée was delivered at 1423, and I had the beef short rib dinner, it was good but may have been too spicy for some people. During dinner, we hit a bad patch of turbulence and the Captain instructed the crew to take their seats at 1438. The dinner service recommenced at 1505. For dessert, I had the hot fudge Ice cream sundae. Overall, dinner was very good. The Polaris cubicle had all the amenities and all equipment worked fine. The entertainment system provided a vast catalog of movies from which to choose. The bathroom had Sunday Riley Face Mist, Sunday Riley Hand Cream and a bottle of garment groom. The bathrooms were kept very clean during the flight. Upon arriving in the SFO airspace, we were put in a holding pattern for about 20 minutes finally landing at 1539 versus a scheduled 1530 and arrived at the gate at 1545. All the business class crew was very nice and helpful, only drawback was no free Wi-Fi in business."
Dec 2019,30,"The flight was good, free wifi was a nice plus.","The flights left on time, no delays. Free wifi movies and t.v. was a nice plus on every leg of the flight. The cabin crew was professional, polite and attentive."
Dec 2019,10,AVOID United Airlines!!!,"This Airline pretends to care, but treats their everyday customers like crap! A serious LACK of CUSTOMER COMMITMENT-despite their catchy slogans. And trying to resolve issues is worse!! Contacting a live person that actually listens is near impossible! “Rubber stamped” phrases is all you get.  They are just too big to care. Other airlines treat you much better. Be wise, and use THEM instead."
Dec 2019,20,"No wifi, no food",United expects us to have our own device to access their entertainment system. But the United app did not work on any of mine. The promised wifi never worked.  It was an over night flight and we were supposed to have a snack. Pretzels and gummy bears are NOT a snack. We didn't even get a coffee/tea with a roll/muffin before landing in the morning.
Dec 2019,10,No carry on,Booked flights thru Expedia and found out that this airline doesn't provide this service even if you want to pay for it. Even cheap airlines like Spirit provide this service.
Dec 2019,50,Mr & Mrs Griggs 2019,one of the best flights my wife and i have taken. The cabin crew were fantastic. The food was good and in flight entertainment had good chose.We will fly with United Airlines anytime.
Dec 2019,50,Excellent Business Meeting flight to San Antonio.,I can deduct the business expense of flying first class to a meeting BUT I would PAY nonetheless. Check-in at Premier Access is quick and easy plus you're bags get extra care to get loaded then unloaded first. The line at the gate was well organized and I got to board in the first group. The seat was comfy and the legroom was nice. The flight WASN'T long enough to merit a breakfast BUT the hot scone snack was tasty. The drinks were fine. I deplaned first and got my luggage quickly. VERY nice experience.
Dec 2019,10,Flights from Hell.,Never fly UNITED unless you have too. I flew from SJO to EWR six times this year mechanical issue and cancelations are just part of it. The service people treat you like your garbage.
Dec 2019,40,Traveling nightmare,"United is not my usual choice in Air Carrier but best connections from my city of residence- Santa Maria.  Boarding at SBA went somewhat late but not overly.  Once boarded it took much too long for push back and then a 15 minute wait for no announced reason. Captain stated vague reason then finally taxi to position and hold- for over ten minuets and then announced after 10 more minuets that airplane not airworthy and deplaning necessary at terminal.  Once deplaned, (took 15 minuets) all passengers re-boarded staring clerical error (paperwork) and yet another wait for flight plan revision before leaving 1 hour 40 minuets late.  Now the connection nightmare in Denver begins. I’ll stop there. Most travelers know the drill (thank goodness for cell phones) and what was to be a 6 hour trip escalated to16 long grueling hours.  Actually I scored United well, I think a 9 out of ten.  The contiguity plan is well set up and user friendly. My choices were poor because My attitude was poor. I was tired to begin with and did not allow for winter travel difficulties and the Holiday season as well.  I arrived safe and most all employees were compassionate and helpful to follow procedure.  What happened in Santa Barbara was handled as well as could be expected. The captain and crew apologized and were professional all the way.  Kudos to those who take their job seriously!"
Dec 2019,10,"Never never United Airline, poor service!","We did our reservation in August 2019 for our daughter's wedding in Nov 20. We fully paid, we booked the direct flight to MIA, we got the confirmation, and paid everything asked by United Airline. United A changed our flight in October without notifying us, the made the changes to connecting flight, and did not want us to refund our money. We were booked to flight of their choice. You can imagine how upset we are because all our hotel booking, car reservation has been affected. United Airline is dishonest and aside from that their customer service is poor! No way, I will with them again. I can't trust them!"
Dec 2019,10,4 hours delayed!,"Lucky for us United Agent said she would get our checked bags and put them on Southwest if we bought a ticket. SW left on time and we made it home for my 73rd birthday celebration. I have over 1,250,000 miles on United, this was very unusual for them. I am asking United to refund $825.00, the cost for the tickets. Had I waited our evening would have been ruined, as United arrived very late into IAH."
Dec 2019,40,Good flight...but,All in all our first time flying United was a good experience. We did fly from Orlando to Newark and then onto Dublin. Returning Dublin/Newark/Orlando. Due to weather all of our flights were delayed and Newark doesn’t have the best record with delayed departures and arrivals. My main concern was with the boarding from Dublin to Newark. The airline allowed many people to abuse the pre boarding so people who pay for expedited boarding really didn’t get what they payed for. It is not just United but this particular leg of the trip was annoying. The Newark to Orlando leg was the best in their boarding. Planes to and from Orlando were older and it showed. Meals were decent. All in all I would fly United again.
Dec 2019,30,Flight to St Maarten,"Very typical flight to St Maarten .. As a handicapped person it is sometimes interesting that United makes you check in and walk 4 doors to get a wheelchair, I had to walk from door 1 to door 4 in the terminal in order to get wheelchair assistance. That is a major problem. On the return flight from SXM which is still be rebuilt, the wheelchair was right there and make the process so much easier."
Dec 2019,40,Nice Flight but Late,Flight was delayed but I received a last minute upgrade and the service was excellent. The flight attendant went out of her way to make it a great flight and the meal was very good for just a two-hour flight. It's unfortunate that United has such a hard time staying on schedule.
Dec 2019,50,Excellent Outbound Las Vegas Flight,"The First Class experience is pretty much worth the price at least for me. With a separate check in area {Premier Access} and expedited baggage handling, there's NO issue with getting your luggage to your destination. I boarded with the first group. My seat and legroom were excellent. I got a drink shortly after being seated. We had a premium snack for the short flight back so I could snooze after another drink. The flight is quieter and smoother up front in my opinion. I deplaned first and got my bags very quickly so the experience was just fine!"
Dec 2019,50,Excellent Las Vegas Inbound Flight,"Since I've upgraded to First Class, I have NO MORE qualms about flying. After on-line check in, my experience at the counter was seemless. With TSA Pre-Check and CLEAR, it was 5 minutes to get through screening. After a visit to the United Lounge, I got to the gate JUST as we were boarding. I got on first and after getting seated I got my drink shortly thereafter. The seat and legromm were confortable. It's more quiet in first class. We got a HOT muffin for an inflight snack. I DIDN'T bother with the entertainment because of the short flight. I got off first and got my luggage quickly without issues. It's worth the price."
Dec 2019,30,Medical Emergency leading to Flight Diversion showcases readiness of airline,"On my recent trip from the US, I flew United back from San Francisco in economy. This was after rushing through a previous connecting domestic flight after that was delayed for three hours. Thank goodness the staff member I approached could offer me a solution and brought me to another flight so that I could catch this SFO-SIN leg. However, an hour into this flight, there was a medical emergency leading to the flight being diverted back to the airport. We circled in the air for an hour to release excess fuel. Due to the short flight duration, crew could not provide a full meal but offered mineral water as well as buns.    Upon arriving at the airport, we had to exit the terminal to process our next flight. By this time the crew had maxed out their service hours so the next flight was about 12 hours behind, and hence we had to queue up to process our next flight individually and collect hotel and meal vouchers. This was around 1/2am in the morning and everyone was tired. However the crew also worked tirelessly to clear the backlog and while there were times they could not help, they did try their best to ensure that we could settle into accommodation. I was helped by a really friendly ground staff member who was apologetic and got me settled within a few minutes.    The hotel was about 10 mins shuttle away but due to the last minute notice, there was only a small 15-20 seater shuttle that could bring everyone to the hotel. Hence by the time we all arrived and checked in, it was already about 4.30am for me. Check in baggage was stored on the plane so I only had what I wore to shower. Locals who stayed in the area had the option to return home and come back in the morning.    The next morning when we returned back to the airport (via the hotel shuttle and not the shuttle provided by the airline), we were back to the flight terminal where I utilised the $30 vouchers provided. This was adequate in an airport where food was pricey but I definitely had to eat more because I wasn’t really keen in the food onboard. The flight back to Singapore was thereafter uneventful and we got back to our lives albeit around 12 hours than scheduled. The pilot was apologetic about the delay and thereafter we also received emails to explain the situation.    This was my first time encountering a flight emergency and while the flight remedy took a bit of time (to find new set of crew and all), I was glad that the airline did take the time to ensure that everyone was taken care of. The individual staff members I met were incredibly helpful and did what they can. You won’t be expecting thoughtful gestures from the airline on the whole, but at least they delivered their promise to bring us to where we wanted and I’m grateful for that."
Dec 2019,30,Flight with some problems,"Upon the check in luggage the United airline employee gave us a wrong & distracted information what to do with luggage upon arrival which gave me a real headache & a lot of worries. Thankful to employees in Brussels the problem was rectified. Also I paid for certain seats & at the gate seats were change to the other seats without any reason despite the fact I paid for the seats. The airline refused to refund the payment. Othe then that was no problem , flight was on time & service was O.K."
Dec 2019,10,limited times to fly no service,very limited times to fly all returns at 6:00am yuuck no free checked bags for seniors forced us to fly out of lguardia my least favorite airport! american airlines was waaayy better.
Dec 2019,40,Good Trip,"The counter service in Pasadena was very good. Our bags actually arrived on the flight before us, so we didn't have to wait upon landing in Newark."
Dec 2019,30,Not bad but they could improve,"Travel to and from rural areas can be a challenge. Overall United has done a good job maintaining their schedules. However, recently there has been a lot of delays, tight connections, and a few missed connections. Their staff has been very nice and tries their best to accommodate no so happy customers for missed connections. Their voucher system for food and drink was easy to use but the voucher for a future flight is a real pain in the backside. I also have to wonder why the Campbell County Wyoming Airport is not subsidized by the U.S. Essential Air Service Program? Flying to connections to Denver is really, really expensive. Also be advised United is the only game in town unless you want to drive 350 miles to DIA. Despite some bad press on United Airlines in past years my experience has been favorable."
Dec 2019,10,I hate flying,"First of all - I HATE flying - even when everything goes well. But it rarely does anyway.  1. Why is the entire system set up as though everyone flies all the time? Signs and lines and gates and more lines and more announcements that can hardly be heard. I bought a carry on - exactly so that I could, wait for it, CARRY IT ON, and was told when getting to the gate that ""they were full and it had to be checked. I had stuff in the side pocket that I couldn't sort through and place in my other laptop bag. Upon arrival, people are pulling multiple bags from the overhead. I call BS on that folks.  2. I understand that some bean counter sold them on the idea of maximizing revenue through adding seats, but at some point the room between seats is ridiculous. C'mon already. And since I was flying for my employer, I was stuck with coach.  3. The whole rental car shuttle thing sucks.  4. Upon arrival at the rental car area, the car I was to get was gone. Actually a good thing since I got a better car for same (hopefully). But the veteran flyers were running for the cars as though those were the last cars on earth and the zombies were attacking. Relax folks. They will get more cars.......from somewhere......I assume??!!  5. Next trip I will drive. I don't care if I have to give up my own personal time to get there. Never going to fly again if I can at all help it.    What an absolute horrible way to travel."
Dec 2019,50,Perfect flight,"On-time takeoff, on-time arrival uneventful in between. Efficient gate agents. Professional cabin attendants."
Dec 2019,40,Flight to Cancun,"I have taken a number of flights in the past 5 years and United never lets me down. The crew have always been nice and friendly. We had one of the ""comedian"" flight attendants during the safety demonstration. I always find that refreshing for something that is so boring. All of our flights arrived early and directions to connecting flight were made. I usually chose my flights by price but I will pay a little more for United."
Dec 2019,10,Maintenance delays,"Flew round trip from Seattle to Des Moines. Both trips experienced significant delays while all passengers were boarded due to maintenance being done on the aircraft. When we asked for information regarding the delay, the flight attendant dismissed us.This is unprofessional in all ways. Will not fly United again, despite the lower prices. Unfortunate."
Dec 2019,10,ZERO stars,Is ZERO stars even possible?  4 hours on the tarmac with VERY LIMITED information. Nothing.  For less than half an inch of snow? With all other planes taking off and landing.  Who the hell of a mass of inept are you guys?  I'm 100% sure you did anything possible to save money on our patience.  ABSURD! FLY ANY OTHER COMPANY BUT THIS ONE!
Dec 2019,30,Nickel Dime - Don't plan to bring any luggage,"Looking online, I saw a fare of between 600-700 for round trip ticket to St. Thomas. Once booking, I found that this 600-700 did not include any checked bags, no seat (have to pay extra for each leg of the flight to get an assigned seat. I ended up paying about $50 per seat x 4 legs of the trip which added about $200 to my flight. I though I could carry on the typical one carry on and one personal item (purse). 36 hours before my flight, United started sending me texts and emails saying that while they'd try their best to get me to my destination, they'd really recommend that I rebook for a different day due to potential for weather. I found out upon checkin that they overbooked the flight and were looking for volunteers to give up their seats. What an underhanded ploy. I had checked the weather it didn't look like there would be any issue to me.    I didn't realize that BASIC ECONOMY does not allow any carry on larger than something like 10"" x 17"" x 9"". I had with me my modestly sized luggage piece, and a very small cooler. In my carry on luggage, I had my computer, thinking that I would be carrying it on. At checkin, I was told that I could only bring one item on and that I'd have to pay YET ANOTHER $30 to check my bag. I sweated out the whole day wondering if my apple computer which was in the checked luggage would make it. I carried my cooler which was full of food and jammed essential from my purse into the cooler and checked the purse in the luggage. Then there was the nightmare at the gate with the gate attendants were asking for volunteers to gate check their bags because they were expecting that the overhead bin space would be full. Then, when essentially nobody volunteered, they demanded that everyone who had paid extra for their ticket (i.e. did not have a BASIC ECONOMY fare) gate check their bags because they said that the overhead bins were full and they wouldn't let anyone board with a carry-on piece of luggage. What incredibly stupid people and what an incredibly stupid system. I am 5'-4"" and 115 lbs and my knees were touching the seat in front of me. Thank God nobody overweight was sitting next to me or they would have been touching me, too.    Then there was some sort of a false mechanical issue which only served to delay us.    Once airborne, the audio at my seat was so muffled and terrible that I couldn't effectively watch/hear anything for the entire first leg of the trip.    The ride home was just as miserable."
Dec 2019,40,Shanghai - Newark business class,"Crew on board was professional and pleasant, flight was on time, even arrived a few minutes earlier, meals were good, inflight service is only disappointment since programs were more for a domestic flight."
Dec 2019,10,If possible fly American Airlines and get treated like a human,"Just got my Marine son, his wife and infant baby checked in. VERY disappointed with the United employee and her lack of customer service. United, you need to train your personal on your bag check policy for active military and in customer service. I would give her name but she refused to give it to me and hid her badge. It was IAH at 11:30 gate C check in and the lady was a brunette of Indian or Hispanic decent. Just in case United is interested in actually coaching and training thier employees. I can't believe the total lack of customer service and rude comments that were made. Our service members, my son or not, deserve some respect. And no one ,military or not, should be treated like an idiot and threatened with force when they are following the rules and being respectful. Thought after a few other PR nightmares United would try to do better, guess not."
Dec 2019,10,"All a bit of a disaster! United delays, overnight stay.","Flying from Newark to Houston. We had a gate change, plane change and over an hours delay before even boarding. Boarding was extremely slow due to having to reissue boarding passes for every passenger. Due to fly 3:50pm. Left at 5:30pm.  They were very apologetic about the delays but offered no explanation. A small bag of pretzels was provided for free. Our connecting flight was due to fly out at 7:55pm.    Upon arrival at 8:18pm were advised to go to Customer service counter. We waited for about 40 mins until we spoke with a lady. She booked us into a hotel and issued meal vouchers. We were asked if we wanted to collect our bags and said yes. This was our first really big mistake! In hindsight we should have said no and left for the hotel then. Also would have been helpful if the lady had advised us against this or told us it could take over 5 hours until we received our bags.    We went down to collect our bags only to be told that it could take hours for them to locate our bags and return them. A couple had been waiting for 5 hours already! Everyone was getting frustrated with the lady who could only say ‘he has the list and I dont know when your bags will be here, it could be 30 mins or it could be hours’.    The lady assured us that when the bags show up she would ensure they get rerouted into our final destination. We waited for about an hour and then left feeling very apprehensive about this but it was getting late and we hadn’t eaten since breakfast time. Called the shuttle and arrived at the Hilton (at 11pm) only to find out they had no food. No restaurant, no room service.    Then when we went to the airport the next day, we were all in different seats, not sitting together. This was upsetting as we had paid extra to choose our seats. To make it worse my son who has special diet needs, had lost the preordered food order from the missed flight. So a 14 hour flight with no food! All and all a disaster. But I guess the positive is we didn’t crash and die."
Dec 2019,10,Think again if you are about to book with United Airlines,"My husband and I are frequent fliers and often go on United.... However we do not fly first class. After waiting for five months with anticipation to fly to Puerto Vallarta Mexico. we got to the check in to find two personal ""Amber"" and another working to see if they could reroute us as the flight we were told was CANCELLED ... Not possibly cancelled or delayed but cancelled.. they also could not tell me why! There was no bad weather... no freezing rain.. fog.. high winds and only a bare inch of snow... we were told they couldn't get us out and they rebooked us for tomorrow.... I joked this was the start of a HallMark movie! and we left as four people came and announced ""we are your LEO's"" they were obviously waiting for them... We left but something didn't set well with me.. so when I got home I opened up uniteds flight tracker and found the flight left! I then looked further and found that there were 15 first class tickets booked for a flight with 10 first class seats!... I called customer service and asked that he verify that the flight 4672 did take off and he said yes mam.. it took off a minute early!.. I then asked him about the connecting flight in Chicago flight 1621... it was scheduled to leave about 15 minutes late but it would leave! THEN I told him why I was calling and asked WHY we had been blatantly lied too.. he of course ""Blas"" is not in a position to say much.... so I asked for his supervisor... personal ID# 13796 :Mary"" came on and again verified that the flights had left... that it was something that needed to be looked into and recommended that I go back to the website and fill in the required complaint forms... said she was sorry!!  so... I went back to the website and was filling in the complaint when I checked facebook.. sure enough they have a facebook page and a quick to respond chatty persona who again apologized.. and said they would have to look into it.... they came back and said there had been a ""Maintenance issue"" however.... Amber the ticket lady couldn't verify the reason for it being cancelled and it flew 1 minute early... how bad of an issue could it possibly be!! Plus... we had confirmed seats 17A and 17B...  they then told me to wait until I was BACK from my vacation and then fill out the complaint form... and offered me $100 dollars! I told them that would refund us for the shuttle fees let alone a nights vacation we had been waiting five months for... or the dog kennel.. and if I took it they would consider the matter closed so.... NO thank you... I do not want the $100 ....they then said they would check this out with the leadership team... but again suggested I fill in the form... THIS IS horrible deception on their part... not weather... not mechanical... and they obviously get away with this often because they didn't seem to think I would be able to say whom I had spoken too or find the information that plainly and clearly is public information on their website.... and they offer me $100!!!!!!!."
Dec 2019,20,Plane Maintenance,"My plane arrived over 30 minutes early but the crew did not examine the plane to see if maintenance was needed until right before boarding, causing most passengers on this flight to miss connecting flights from Chicago. They promised hotel vouchers but don't cover other expenses incurred by delay (without insurance).    Similarly, the plane right before mine (also United Airlines) had been delayed over 2 hours at the same Gate for ""maintenance"" as well.    In sum, whatever maintenance needs to done to planes between scheduled flights does not appear to get done properly, impacting those who schedule flights with this airline. Will shop other airlines in the future."
Dec 2019,20,Terrible flight,"This airline is a joke, booked a while ago and when we checked in we needed to pay for carry on bags! No checked bags normal carry ons , then we were delayed for 40 minutes because they screwed up on another flight so we had to wait because of their incompetence! Don’t fly United."
Dec 2019,30,mechanical problem cancel our trip to rome had to reschedule with Luftansa,"bad plane and bad customer service , they are under a lot of stress, went to customer service and inquire about food voucher , stated that he told us where to go and that was all he could help instead of looking at his computer and print voucher"
Dec 2019,50,Aloha Trip,committing to a flight early on allows you to select your seats. I prefer an aisle seat and so that really makes a difference. From Houston to Honolulu is a direct flight which made it nice to shorten the trip a bit. Service was nice. I did try to connect to the app on my laptop so I could watch the movies that were streaming but we decided to download some shows and watch it from our laptop. Worked out very well. There are plugs below the seats to allow you to charge your laptop.
Dec 2019,40,Great flight,"The only negative thing is that you can not pick seats flying basic economy unless you pay for it. But many airlines have the same practice now.  The flight was on time, no issues. They serve soft drinks and snacks free of charge"
Dec 2019,50,"Easy, On Time, Comfortable","We took a Saturday 8:30 AM flight out of Dulles on United, sitting in the Premium Economy seats, which simply offer more leg room. The flight was due to get in at 12:30 PM but arrived a little before noon. It took off on time and landed early. No issues in the air. Service was good. Flight attendants were lovely. The return flight the following Saturday left at noon and landed at 3:30, earlier than expected. Same comments on the return flight. We'd definitely fly United again!"
Dec 2019,10,Will never fly this airline ever again,"Missed my connection due to an error of United, completely unprofessional. Then the next flight available (after going through countless combinations of alternate airports, with me bending over backwards to make United’s mistake work) the next flight was FIVE HOURS later. I was left sitting in the airport for five hours with no compensation from United to sweeten the deal of their mistake. I will never ever fly this airline again. Horrible experience"
Dec 2019,10,This airline is garbage,"woke up early to be in time to my flight. Very routine for anyone who has been on a flight. Got to the airport at 8:30. As we check in the bags the employee informs us that our 10 AM flight has been delayed til 4:10 PM. Already a little upset? Yes! However I keep everything under control bc I understand they are just trying to keep people safe... the reason I was given for the delay.... weather. FOUR HOURS LATER I’m told that the emergency lights were not working. First sign of a bullcrap company, lying to its customers for the reason of the delay. I have been sitting at the airport for 7 hours when I get a flight update that says it’s been delayed again... til 7!! I understand things happen but the longest flight in the United States is NOT how long I waited. If this company cared at all about its customers it would have freed a flight and sent it here. The plane we were supposed to Yale should be decommissioned and never flown again. United is the worst airline I have ever flown on. AND I WILL NEVER FLY UNITED AGAIN!!!!"
Dec 2019,10,Fly the miserable skies,"First of all, the flight attendants at United are the most miserable lot you can imagine.  I have no clue why they work in this industry when it is apparent that they hate their jobs and the people that they are supposed to serve. I have flown way too many times on this miserable airline but will never fly them again. This flight crew actually announced over 20 times to not get up when the seat belt light is on!! And to add insult, they say it with contempt in their voice. Not one single attendant on this flight was cheerful or even smile once!  Also, don't bother paying extra for economy plus unless you are 7' tall. You get the same lousy service and you are over the jet engine which is so loud you can't hear yourself think. Plus you are as far away from the toilet as you can get on this plane."
Dec 2019,40,Overall pretty good experience,"I flew on air miles points from Calgary, AB to Austin, TX via Denver, CO. Between departure and return I had a total of 4 legs, and there were no more than 3 empty seats between all the legs. Flight check-in was pleasant and boarding was very efficient. UA was very good about enforcing carry-on restrictions, polite but firm and reduced pressure on the overhead bins by checking quite a few pieces of luggage through at the gate.  Our initial departure was delayed by 30 minutes because the ground crew had a mechanical failure with the tow unit. The captain kept us informed throughout.  We made our tight connection in Denver and arrived in Austin on time. However, our luggage did not. The lost luggage report went smoothly and UA delivered our luggage to the hotel just before midnight the same day  The first leg of our trip was on a Boeing 737-800 which was extremely cramped and the remaining 3 legs were on A320's which are much more comfortable. If aircraft information is available choosing a flight with the A320 is a no-brainer.  Unlike some airlines UA did offer some basic complimentary snacks/drinks on their flights.  Considering I traveled using the absolute cheapest method I was pleased. If it weren't for having such a tight connection that even a minor delay resulted in lost luggage I would have given 5 stars."
Dec 2019,20,NOT GOOD,"OK for a six hour flight....very poor... NO meal, NO entertainment and the seats are too close together. Plane was old and not so clean. United used to say fly the friendly skies....Not so friendly anymore."
Dec 2019,50,Fabulous flight,"We decided to upgrade at the last minute to united Polaris class. It was wonderful..the service was spectacular and because we were flying over night, I actually got some rest to be able to hit the ground running when we arrived at 7 am"
Dec 2019,40,Buffalo to Santo Domingo DR,"Staff at check in to and from helpful and friendly, were able to make seat changes for us. Nice to be keep informed of why plane was late leaving"
Dec 2019,10,United Airlines- Too big to care about individual flyers!,"United is always boasting about attention/concern for customers. And when you bring a legitimate question or situation that needs to be explained or corrected, they always respond via e-mail with a words that sound like they care. But I have experienced time & time again: They are just empty words. It's as if they just 'plug in' certain key words or 'catch phrases', but dont really act on the problem. I had several troubling encounters with 1)a reservation/check-in, 2)counter agent handling another leg of our very long flight. Both were EXTREMELY stressful to my wife& I! I tried to contact United to clear things up; It has yet to be resolved! They barely addressed my concerns at all!  United has become a very disappointing Airline to us. And sadly, we've been with them for many years! United Airlines has truly become like many other huge corporations-""Profits before people""! EXCEPT: This is supposed to be a 'Service' Company!  What makes it worse, their constant claim to 'do thingd for us, the customer! In words & their own videos, only!"
Dec 2019,10,Do not fly w UA,"Consistently inconsiderate staff. Always treated like a second class citizen when flying economy.    UA Overbooked flight 3x in a row now, and I've had to be put on a later flight.    Late arrivals, insane baggage restrictions, lost check baggage, minimal in flight snacks.    Do not fly united."
Dec 2019,10,United Fails again,"Why is it that EVERY time I fly United there is another issue? After gathering cob webs waiting at the gate for an eternity, Now being told our departure is delayed 1 hour 45 min and I DON’T BELIEVE THEM. Will be surprised if we get out of here at all. Pathetic"
Dec 2019,50,Long Haul in a 787-10 - The Best!,"OK, long haul is never great but this one was way the heck better than I have ever had before - the aircraft was new, a sparkling Boeing 787-10, and it had a number of features that made things much more bearable. First was the crew - this is a trip that attracts the more senior grew members and they were great. Second is that the seats now recline and the base also moves, which makes sitting a lot better. Environment in the cabin is great, everything just worked.    Pro tip - get a quality neck pillow, not the garbage that you find in the airport. We used memory foam ones from Amazon and they gave great support - pull the seat headrest all the way up so that the pillow fits under it, you will thank me for that.    The only negative aspect was the entertainment system - the sound was an unintelligible garble no matter what was selected. Tried several sets of headphones with no difference so it had to be in the software somewhere."
Dec 2019,30,Last flight of this trip was good,This was the final leg on my return to Seattle. The flight boarded on time as well as departed on time. We even arrived a few minutes early which is always nice.
Dec 2019,10,Worst airline I’ve ever been on,"This airline is nothing short of a scam. They make you pay extra to bring carry one with no guarantee that you can actually bring them on. I told the lady I paid extra for a carry on and she angrily said it wasn’t her problem. Not to mention, I was stuck in another state for a full night due to their unwillingness to help out and work with me. Horribly rude staff, utterly unhelpful. Worst experience of my life. Wish I could give them 0 stars."
Dec 2019,40,"Enjoyable Staff, but Takeoff Delay","Had a great time in first class our flight from Newark to Hawaii. Although the plane ride itself was very bumpy, the staff was exceptional - and they tried to make the best of it. The food was delicious (who doesn't love a pretzel bun burger) and the drinks were plentiful! Reclining seats made the ride a bit easier as well as a large selection of movies to watch. We were delayed slightly due to a broken seatbelt, as I believe the plane had been chartered by an NFL team before us - but other than that, overall great experience. I would recommend upgrading to first class for this long flight if possible!"
Dec 2019,50,Review,"My experience was delightful except for the delay on maintenance and the weather, but we cant control certain things. You guys did an awsome job and Thank you."
Dec 2019,20,"Maybe United can start doing maintenance on their planes in their time, instead of mine.","Both ways on this trip, delays made a 4 hr trip into a 10-12 hr one. Both times, due to maintenance issues. Not maintenance issues they just found, but issues from hours and trips earlier.  So, long hours in the airport waiting for connecting flights, but when asking for a complimentary lounge pass, it was made pretty clear that was the most ridiculous thing ever. Thing is, out of the last 4 travels with United, none were without delays, all resulted in 4+ hours delayed arrival, most of which arriving after midnight. I know most airlines have occasional issues, but it seems with United I rarely don’t have issues."
Dec 2019,10,No meal for 10 hrs 41m non-stop flight?,"I called United Airline customer service to request my children's meal. Even though it is 10hrs 40min non-stop flight, you have to purchase meals. Because it is domestic flight.    (From D.C to London UK is only 6hrs 55min, UA will provide meals.)    I am glad that I found out this before my trip. However it does not make sense to me at all."
Dec 2019,10,Terrible,"United airlines is probably the worst airline to exist. Every time we’ve flown, they always lose our bags. Their customer service is terrible and they don’t know how to do anything right... save yourself stress and time and fly a different airline."
Dec 2019,40,Convenient flight,Slightly delayed flight from O’Hare all the way to San Francisco.    The flight was full but the crew were very good to serve every passenger with a smile and courtesy
Dec 2019,40,UA to Osaka in Thanksgiving,"The direct flight from San Francisco to Osaka was great. First time to experience direct flight to and return from Japan. Family of 4 went off without any issues. Overall a satisfying trip again to Japan. The plane does need additional cleaning thou. The food was okay to mediocre. Typical drinks and wine with meals. Although booked early in Feb. for the Nov. trip, ended with seats at the rear of the plane. Wonder how the seats become available through the ticketing agencies?"
Dec 2019,10,Absolutely HORRIBLE!!,We had to sit on the plane for 2 hours while they figure out a different route to Denver due to a “storm” which my brother flew through it on Delta. They have turned a 2.5 hour flight into an almost 6 hour flight because now we have to go to Chicago to refuel and then head to Denver and won’t arrive til 1 am.
Dec 2019,10,Absolutely Horrible .... Avoid at all costs.,"Absolutely horrible if you are traveling in economy because they treat you like they are doing you a favor flying you. Amenities are a joke, they offer Parle G biscuits if you want to eat something light, my 13 year old wanted coke and they offered him coke on the whole 16 hour flight twice and then declined the third time saying they have to limit it to two glasses. Staff always walk around with a frown as if they are on forced labor. God help you during check in at Newark. They refused to take the bag even though it was only half a pound overweight so I went and reshuffled the bags and weighed the bags at a counter and then went to drop the bag and they refused to accept the bag although very clearly it was their weighing scale that was off. Supervisor said she could not help and I was wondering why the hell was she even there. All in all I would not even fly United for free. Thank god they did not expect the economy passengers to jump by parachute instead of landing at the airport.  AVOID at all costs."
Dec 2019,40,Great flight.,Flying to PV is easy peezy. From San Francisco it's a 3+ hour flight. Great place to go if you want to get away for just a few days.
Dec 2019,20,Travelers Beware!,"Had a bad experience on Flight 526 from Denver to Anchorage.  I sat in Row 26 with two United Airline Frequent Flyers. When the much anticipated food cart got about three rows before us, they ran out of food....everything.  Approximately 60 people (about 1/3rd of the airplane) had no opportunity to purchase a little sustenance for the 6 hour flight. They included several families with small children.  United books every flight to full capacity, but doesn’t carry enough food/snacks for passengers even though the flight spans dinner time?  United does not care about the well being of their clients. Shame on you! United charged me $850 for a one way ticket, then charged me $30 for a single bag. Feeling gouged and very unhappy. Scrooged by United!"
Dec 2019,10,Honeymoon Ruined Thanks to United 👌,"I will never fly United. Travelers beware, your entire vacation will be ruined due to lack of professionalism and lack of basic business ethics that United Airlines can’t seem to figure out after 20+ years of service. You couldn’t pay me to fly with more. I would rather fly with Spirit, sitting on nails and drinking sand paper before i ever trust United Airlines with getting me to my vacation on time. Excuses after excuses, they made us board and then get off 3 different planes within 8 years of trying to fly us out. Save your money and stress. KEEP AWAY!"
Dec 2019,10,They were going to make me miss my brothers wedding over money.,"I spent two hours on a runway only to have my plane towed back to the gate where we had to exit the plane a book another one. My brothers wedding was that night. My flight was from Fort Lauderdale to Newark scheduled for a 10:30am departure and a 1:30pm arrival. When I called your service the “best” they could do for me was give me a flight for 8pm departure 12am arrival. I would have missed the entire wedding. I decided to look into it on my own and found another united flight departing at 4:30pm and arriving at 7:30pm in Miami airport. It was a $1,300.00 ticket, first class, but I only have one brother and making it to his wedding came with no price. When I called united and asked them why they didn’t put me on that flight to begin with they told me it was up to the personality of the person that picked up. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Because I didn’t purchase a first class ticket, United didn’t care about getting me to my brothers wedding they only cared about their money. I am beyond distasted with this company and I will never fly with them again. My family bent over backwards to get me home, all United had to do was make it right and get me home and because the “personality” of the person that I dealt with didn’t feel like giving me that. Absolutely awful. I will be telling all of my family, friends, and patients to stay away from such a heartless company."
Dec 2019,50,Excellent,"Excellent customer service, good flight! Quiet and smooth ride. One of the bathrooms was very big compared to usual ones."
Dec 2019,30,"Unexpected, Unscheduled Stop",The flight was scheduled to arrive at 2155 and was delayed due to a unscheduled stop in Russia. There was nothing in the itiniary or notification given to indicate that the flight was making a stop prior to final destination. Family members waiting for an additional hour +.
Dec 2019,50,very pleased,"Enjoyed this flight. Had reasonable leg room, seats were OK. Staff were really helpful, providing dinner & breakfast. We had good communication from the pilot, eg advised us of conditions ahead regularly & when held up for 15 min on tarmac before docking he told us why. He also gave us a smooth landing. Did 6 flights with United on this holiday, not were all as good as this, but I would fly with them again."
Dec 2019,10,Back To The '90s,"My mouth fell open when the United website informed me that I could not check-in online. Why? Because I wasn't paying them extra money for baggage. ONLY at-airport check-in was offered. Everyone has been able to check-in online for, what, 20 years? ""Absurd"" and ""ridiculous"" come to mind, but really neither word is strong enough."
Dec 2019,30,Fair,"The flight was delayed by an hour. And it is so uncomfortable to arrive at the Airport, then go through immigration, thanks I use the Passport App, which expedited my entrance and you have to exit the airport and enter again. Of course I nearly miss my connecting flight.  But my luggage did. Because it turns out that, despite the luggage receipt had my final destination on, you have to take it out and go through the airline counter again and check the baggage. Really annoying.  The airline sent it the next day.  They had already scheduled me for a flight next day, but I was not sure if they were going to cover accommodations and dinner. Never knew why the flight was delayed.  As per service it is ok. Review always your luggage allowance before your flight as it changes and they charge for each suitcase. They serve some cookies and something to drink onboard. Pretty clean aircraft and nice crew. I love the Entertainment App to view during the flight."
Dec 2019,40,Business Class IAH - GUA,"We purchased this ticket and used a regional upgrade and immediately got the upgrade at purchase. It was a short 2.5 hour flight from Houston to Guatemala. Since it was an evening flight which left Houston around 7:30 pm, we had a dinner service. The option was chicken or beef. The food was OK.    We left on time and arrived a few minutes early. Our bag came out pretty quickly at baggage claim. On the flight, they handed out the Immigration Forms for us to fill out."
Dec 2019,40,Comfortable flight,"This is a pretty uneventful flight from Houston to San Francisco.    Service in my cabin was good as the attendant was patient and pleasant. While the flight did not have any monitor, Unitedas entertainment system is provided FOC so I was able to catch my favorite movies through my mobile devices."
Dec 2019,40,Comfortable and surprisingly good service,Took this flight to return from San Francisco to Shanghai.    Loved the United Polaris lounge. Apparently it is voted #1 in the world. It's good but I have seen better.    Flight configuration for business class was 1-2-1 so I picked the single seat by the window. Hardware worked fine and I enjoyed the entertainment system.    What was most surprising to me was the service which actually turned out to be above my expectations for United.
Dec 2019,10,Wow,Flight was delayed every 20 minutes from 5:15 PM to 10 PM until it was ultimately cancelled. They moved out gate 3 times and i had to go across the airport on a shuttle to the new gate only to have the flight cancelled. All due to mechanical issues. United sux
Dec 2019,20,More than disappointing,"Small plane - few services - wine and beer selection was poor, not a cushion on the flight - and the blankets were so thin they were unusable.  First Class - your kidding!  Have to compare to business class on New Zealand from Auckland to Honolulu - actually no compassion - should have done NZ all the way."
Dec 2019,50,Surprised!,"I usually only fly WestJet if I can help it. This time it was not possible as WJ flight was way too expensive. I booked with United as it was the most inexpensive option. I was so pleasantly surprised! App works great, updating any changes right away. In flight entertainment was great with either seat back tv or watch via app. Lots of selection for TV shows and movies. Flight attendant service was great, I witnessed a few times that flight attendants went out of their way to help one of my fellow travellers. Pilots communicated clearly and often which really eased flying anxiety. GPS was accurate and easy to follow. I will fly United again in the future without hesitation. Last flight of my journey I was on the Star Wars aircraft which was pretty cool."
Dec 2019,50,United airlines flight,I’ve used United Airlines for 99% of my flight transportation.  They make accommodating and flight arrangements when inconvenience occurs with weather!    The airline crew is friendly and accommodating. They make sure the passengers are taken care of and that’s great service.    I’d recommend this airline
Dec 2019,30,Good flight,My return flight from Mexico to Houston departed on time and arrived just a couple minutes late. (Most likely due to air traffic).
Dec 2019,10,Hopefully this was the last time,"Traveling with this airline has not been good most of the time. This time the flight was on time, the employee at the gate was friendly, efficient and helpful. However, on-board I keep noticing that flight attendants do not seem to value passengers. The lady seemed bothered by the passengers and had a rude attitude. Everything was rushed, even the safety demonstrations and food was minimal, and always is. No matter if you choose first class or economy, good service is lacking. I always preferred American Airlines, due to the excellent service provided in all areas, especially on-board, but this year gave United a chance on several occasions. Unfortunately, due to the lack of decent service, I am now choosing other airlines for both business and pleasure."
Dec 2019,40,Terrific service from a leading airline Great trip and service,I was very impressed with United. Terrific job. The only drawback is Chicago. That is a mess to get into and out of.
Dec 2019,50,Great longhaul flight,I flew the morning flight from London to Houston and had no complaints. The breakfast was nice with options of chicken and waffles or scrambled eggs and bacon. The entertainment options were broad. I’m 6’4 and the legroom was bearable. They offered a small snack closer to landing as well which was nice and well needed. Overall a great flight
Dec 2019,30,Cheapest alternative but will weigh my options better in the future.,Flight was a bit delayed out of Chicago. Had to hustle to make it to my connection to Port of Spain. Bags came in TWO DAYS later. Tightest economy seating i have ever experienced. Basic complementary snacks. In flight entertainment was ok and staff were friendly.
Dec 2019,40,Chaos to Calm,"So the experience at PLS was quite chaotic, however the counter service was friendly and efficient. I had upgraded to business class, but there was really no lounge in this airport. The airport itself was chaotic, but the team doing the boarding kept everyone in line and while we boarded late, we left on time. The crew in business was very friendly and were quick to ask if you needed anything. I was a little bummed that the inflight wifi didn't work until we were over the US, but the DirectTV movies were free so I was able to watch that. The food was a tad on the bland side, but the warm cookie was a spirit uplifter. Even though the seats are wider and more plush, I felt a little on the cramped side, seat wise. I was in the first row so I had able leg room, but the business class bathroom was the same closet that is on every short flight. Good trip all around."
Dec 2019,30,Clean No Amenities,My flight with United Airlines was decent. The flight want so the person on the outside seat sat in the row behind giving us all more space to spread out.    For some reason my seat wouldn’t go back. But I didn’t end up sleeping so this was okie.    The Biscoff snacks were tiny. Delta and American Airlines serve a larger version of the same snack. The charger at my seat was so loose I had to rig it by pushing my bag up against it.    Bathroom smelled amazing. Stewards were friendly. Flight was faster than expected. Cabin wasn’t cold but instead very comfortable. I didn’t need my blanket I always travel with because I’m always so cold on flights.    They do offer WiFi but it’s not free like JetBlue.
Dec 2019,10,DON'T FLY UNITED AIRLINES,"DON'T FLY UNITED AIRLINES...here's why. On an 8 hour flight they serve u pretzels...no more airplane breakfast, lunch, or dinner(if you didn't care for it before you will miss it now). I had to tackle the flight attendant to get her to provide a cup of water...she flew past us three times. Also in one leg of our flight I picked window seats 4 months in advance to avoid getting stuck in the middle and guess what...without any advance warning they changed the type of plane to one with less seats accross and...you guessed it, I wound up in the middle seat!!!  Avoid this airline...use any other carrier, you'll be glad you did."
Dec 2019,30,Uncomfortable seats,The seats had very little padding and were quite uncomfortable. Was also disappointed in connection information in Houston. Had to ask a gate attendant where to go for our connecting flight.
Dec 2019,50,Flight 1978- A No Man's Flight,"I had the unique opportunity of flying United Airlines Flight 1978 from Newark,NJ to San Francisco, California on Saturday November 23rd 2019. What made this flight different from any others I've taken (and certainly those taken by all the other passengers on board,) was,this was an all female flight crew.  Surprisingly,I had no idea how few flights have ever been undertaken with all female flight crew members. We were among just a handful of flights across the world where this has occurred. I would have expected at close to the end of 2019, this would be a more common occurrence.    Although we endured some turbulence over the Sierra Nevada Mountains, this crew handled it with ease.  The crew members were all professional,personable, knowledgeable & made the passengers feel they were part of an important, historical flight. Our crew made excellent time as we arrived in San Francisco just more than 20 minutes ahead of schedule.We all recognized the significance of our journey & our appreciation by the rousing applause given for the crew upon our arrival. We had indeed been flying the friendly skies. Wishing more flights felt like the 6+ hour trip, ""flew by!"" Yes, pun intended!"
Dec 2019,20,Absolutely no legroom,"I typically don't fly United, but it was the best option for my latest trip to CA. When I boarded the flight, I was greeted by a bitter flight attendant. She was trying to serve first class passengers during the general boarding process and wanted nothing to do with the riffraff on their way to the back of the plane. When I got to my row, I was shocked at how little leg room I had. I am a very average man - 5'10"" and 180 lbs. When the seat is uncomfortable for me, I cant imagine how awful it would be for taller travelers. The plane was hot for the whole 4 hours and the crew was miserable. I will definitely not fly on United if I have a choice!"
Dec 2019,30,"Good flight, but charge your batteries beforehand","Efficient two-hour commuter flight. Flew on an Embraer, the kind with one seat on the left on two on the right in economy class. I was reasonably comfortable (and I'm 6'4""). Biggest complaints are that there were neither power nor USB jacks, and there wasn't any in-flight wifi or entertainment. Make sure your batteries are fully charged"
Dec 2019,40,Nice ride to LA,Our B737 800/900 aircraft was a full load and our economy seat was very comfortable with good legroom. A five-hour flight with friendly and courteous sevice. We optioned to check-in our onboard luggage at the terminal gate at no extra cost- a good choice as the overheads compartment were full. Alcohol and menu food is an additional cost otherwise small meals and drinks were reasonable.Entertainment was very average - 6-7 movies and nothing else!! Encountered moderate turbulence from El Paso to Phoenix with seat belt sign lit. Aircraft handled it really well.
Dec 2019,50,Back & Forth to Orlando with No Problems,Everything went smoothly both ways. They even arrived both times a little early. Airline seats are airline seats. Flight attendants were cordial.  Boarding & de-planing took some time - not the airlines fault it's the traveler's taking everything but the kitchen sink for a 2/12 hour flight.
Dec 2019,10,Airline sucks,"Wtf? This is a horrible airline. We traveled United and they separated all 3 of us throughout the plane, WE ARE TRAVELING WITH A 3YR OLD, WTF! this airline should be shut down, complete idiots! Worst"
Dec 2019,10,Rude staff,"I went to boarding gate to query if I had to collect my luggage at connecting flight. I greeted her with good morning, but she gave no response but blank expression less face. On asking she said she couldn’t do anything and I had to see my baggage tag. I showed her my baggage tag and she said no, “you collect it at my final destination” and then she started typing straightaway as if she was checking further detail. On asking again she very rudely said, “I’ve already told you sir”. This is a kind of behaviour I see very common across United staff. Just add “sir” at the end and they think they can talk in any tone."
Dec 2019,30,Be careful what you wish for!,"While United has always been my “go to” airline, I’m beginning to look at other airlines for travel to Florida. The flights & personnel are fine - its all about United’s pricing. Their basic economy sounded like a great deal - flying from California to Florida isn’t cheap, and add to that the cost of a cruise, and you find yourself looking for any discount you can! So when I found what sounded like a great price ($258 round trip) I jumped on it. The “other shoe” dropped almost immediately - couldn’t pick a seat unless I was willing to pay at least $13 per seat, per leg (window & aisle seats were $50); no carry on luggage other than a personal item (ie purse or laptop only); and couldn’t guarantee my husband & I would be sitting next to or near each other. We have all become used to paying for luggage ($30 per bag), but the other charges made my “great price” as much or more than the regular economy price! I love this flight because it’s only stop is in Houston, & I don’t have to go to Chicago or New York to get to Florida, and as a 70+ traveler, those extra hours and equipment changes really add up! Flying from the west coast isn’t cheap or easy, but I’ll definitely explore other airlines & check the “fine print” more closely for our next flight!"
Dec 2019,10,Awful customer service,"Do not fly with united. They stole $150 from me and won't refund it. Just a terrible, sleazy company. Do NOT fly united at all costs."
Dec 2019,50,Great flight,"Flight was on time, attendants very helpful. Pilot kept in contact. We arrived early. Spent the wait time in the United club. Very courteous ans professional."
Dec 2019,40,Good flight,"My flight was just fine...pleasant staff. However, when I wanted to order food, I asked for the Tappas box. There were none left. I asked for the cheese and fruit box. There were none left. Apparently, unless your seat is close to the front of the plane, you're out of luck. This is the third flight for me when those items were gone before the cart came to me. If those are the most popular orders, adding more would be a good plan. They also ran out of customs declaration forms and we had to pick ours up as we exited the plane. ...not a big deal except, with hands full, we then had to fill out the form before going to customs."
Dec 2019,30,ok airline,Nothing wrong with the planes and maintenance as far as I can say.  What I find surprising is the old fashion check in mixed with computerised boarding passes where a separate person helps you to get the boarding pass.  the check in formalities in general are tedious.
Dec 2019,10,The absolute WORST customer service of any airline,The airline regularly cancels this flight on Fridays. Also my vouchers for hotel & food didn’t work. No help over the phone and horrible reimbursement process. The airlines are required by law to provide these items when they cancel a flight. I think United is happy to cancel this flight because it is a tax payer subsidized route. Shame on you United!
Dec 2019,40,Short Pleasure Trip,The flight was on time & the flight attendants were very friendly. We were kept informed about the duration of the flight at all times.
Dec 2019,10,WORST AIRLINE OUT THERE,This airline does not care about your time and they delay you without warning or any communication . I fly in and out of Chicago frequently and it is appalling how this airline neglects to communicate and almost purposely wastes your time.
Dec 2019,10,Horrible customer service. Always late. Won’t pay for hotels when they strand you - even when weather is not the problem,United came into New Orleans late. Then sat on tarmac for extra 20min claiming air traffic control problem. Got into Houston late. We might have still made our connecting flight to Toronto except that flight took off early. Beautiful weather at both ends. No one to help till a huge line of disgruntled travellers looking for help. Hours later and a lot of phone calls we booked a flight for next day. United helped us book a motel but then refused to pay for it saying delay was due to bad weather! Unbelievable. Now trying to get help but United won’t talk to anyone. Please NEVER fly United Airlines.  Our luggage finally made it home 2 days after us.
Dec 2019,10,Horrible,DO NOT ever fly united business class. What a sham they are selling. We bumped up to business class on our flight. We received one drink the whole flight to Mexico. No food no snacks. We should’ve just stayed in coach if that’s what they think business class is. I made a formal complaint to there complaint department. They answered sorry for your inconvenience but we can’t refund your money. Interesting they said that. The couple we went with were refunded their money. But we didn’t? How easy wouldn’t have been just to refund our money. Thank you united! You just made it very easy on me. I WILL NEVER fly with you again.
Dec 2019,40,nice jet,the airplane is new one 787 dremliner very confortable with a good leg room  the food is mediocre they need to improve it
Dec 2019,40,Nice flight,Great service from United. Plenty of food and drink. Good friendly staff. I will definitely fly with united again.
Dec 2019,50,Amazing trip,Hurricane Jerry was heading toward the gulf coast...I was delayed for a couple of hours in Lafayette.. Finally we were able to leave but the flight did take us a couple of hours due to the storm hitting Houston... But we did land and of course I missed my flight to Minneapolis.. United Airlines made another appointment with the next flight out.. That was just so awesome for me.. Delayed or not I was able to reach my destination with out a problem..
Dec 2019,50,Great Airline,"United Airlines is my second favorite airline to fly. They have nice clean planes, great pilots and stewardesses. The flight I was one was on time and smooth. I would definitely fly with them again."
Dec 2019,50,First Time for a Long Flight,"I was seriously concerned about enduring a 7 or 8 hour but it turned out to be very tolerable. The seats were comfortable enough for sleep although that didn't work for me. Luckily, the combination of several meals, snacks, and free in seat movies made the time pass quite tolerably. The attendants efficiently served the needs of the passengers and were always available if needed. Pillows and blankets were provided. Flights were completed without delays and best of all, safely."
Dec 2019,50,If you get caught between the Moon & New York City,"Late Night Monday 12/09/19 on my way to EWR (New Jersey) with a connecting flight for Tuesday AM but- it's a Once Daily flight! This is my only chance to make it on Time, otherwise I'M left hanging like wet clothes on GrandMa's outdoor line. The crew was outstanding, the pretzel cool , 0h yes they always are when you're hungry :) I had an empty seat beside me (Main cabin) so it was easy to stretch out since I used the tray beside me. The free UA App you can download is a neat gift to yourself - for free movie watching on their flights. As we prepared for landing I saw an awesome sight of a lovely Moon glowing outside my window. Those glittering lights of the city below and that sexy Red Haired Vixen seated across the aisle, flashing her flirty smile - all made for a wonderful packaged view ' t'was then I imagined myself in the lyrics of Christopher Cross's #1 Hit ... ""When U get caught between the Moon & New York (or Newark) City, the best that you can do is fall in love!"
Dec 2019,50,"Good flight, on time!","We got this ticket for very cheap price, we tough that will be pretty bad like the economy airlines, however, they offered us soft drinks and pretzels making our flight more comfortable."
Dec 2019,40,Decent if you're traveling light,"I used Basic Economy, which worked out fine because I was travelling for one weekend so I fit everything in a small backpack that I kept under my seat. The movie/TV selection and snacks were decent, and there's enough space in each seat. Downside is that you can't complete check-in until you're at the airport if you aren't checking in any bags."
Dec 2019,30,First Class is a rip off!,"Honestly, I fly 1/C because of a disability. After many years of flying, for me most airlines I've flown have simply eliminated service in coach and what limited service that was available in coach is now the new First Class. I believe United is by far the worst of the worst! There attendants are clearly instructed to do the minimum and then make themselves scarce. I took a 5 hour flight at 5PM and we were offered a mini snack, without even being offered items for purchase offered to coach. The only reason I fly United is it is the only non-stop available, but it has reached the point that I am considered putting up with 8hour (and longer) flights just to have the option of not flying United. Even the new seats are much smaller and uncomfortable!"
Dec 2019,10,Rip Off,"I am currently a student who is transferring out of state from california to texas. I payed for the flight for about $300. They charged me a total of an extra $220 for three bags. Two of the bags that I had were overweight by a few pounds which made them charge me an ADDITIONAL $200. I called customer service to try and help me out or give me a discount because I could get a southwest airline ticket for half the price after all fees for my baggage. I was charged about $720 for a flight that was supposed to be less than half the price. I am disappointed that they left me with no options, and I could not even get a refund for my flight if I canceled. RIDICULOUS!"
Dec 2019,20,Never travel Economy on UNITED,I think the class was Basic Economy. It was terrible. When we checked in onine we discovered we could not bring a carry-on. Only a personal item that had to fit under the seat. We had not option can change or upgrade our seats. We had 70 year olds traveling 8 hours in seats that do not reclice. This is the first time we've traveled this far and we didn't get any food.
Dec 2019,50,United First Class is the best.,"Dominic and the rest of the flight attendant crew were terrific. They frequently made rounds to ensure that we had what we needed in terms of beverages and snacks. The vegan meal was terrific, too. The first class seating is most comfortable."
Dec 2019,40,I travel for a living,"I am a Million mile flyer with United. I have flown 166,400 miles YTD. I get a lot of people asking me who is the lesser of the airline evils. For me it is United."
Dec 2019,20,less and less for loyal passengers--time to bail from this airline,"This review has nothing to do with the flight indicated--it is a general review. I have flown United for more than 20 years, and it has gone downhill all the way. Economy used to be decent, with economy plus very good. Now economy is outright uncomfortable, and economy plus is not as good as the old economy class used to be. Everything is charged for outside of business class. I do fly business every now and then and it is no better than other airlines, and poorer than many. I have always been a premier flyer, usually gold or platinum, and that now gives you zero upgrades--they may as well not bother having that as a perc. Much less joy in the attendants and agents--its not a classy job anymore---a lot of pressure everywhere and lots of complaints.  Then the United clubs have been reconfigured to give the general premier flyer less. Nice seats and wifi and that's about it May as well just stay in the airport main lounge  areas. I fly 2 or 3 times internationally each year and the United lounges all pale compared to other airlines. In summary, forget United and start using another airline. Preferably one that cares about passenger comfort, service and loyalty."
Dec 2019,40,"Good ground & in-flight service, smooth flight","Hello folks!    This is another review of United Airlines which I took from Los Angeles to San Francisco connecting to another United bound for Haneda Airport in Tokyo. Check-in went smoothly, our bags was checked through to Haneda so all we had to do when we arrived in San Francisco was connect to another United flight bound for Haneda.    Coming back we flew out from Narita airport bound for LAX and it was also a smooth flight. Inflight meal as always is nothing to rave about but what can we expect from economy class. We upgraded our seats to Economy Plus on both segments (inbound and outbound) and it was awesome to have that extra inches of leg room during a long flight time - It sure makes a difference! If any of the readers are contemplating upgrading to Economy Plus seats, I highly recommend it for long flights.    All in all, it was a great flight experience. Airfare was reasonably priced compared to other major carriers.    Until next time, happy traveling!"
Dec 2019,30,No Internet,"First class was fine. On a short flight you pretty much don't get even a snack box, just a choice of a token bag of chips and the like. The WIFI Internet did not work the entire flight. Again, short trip so wasn't too upset but it's not uncommon."
Dec 2019,30,"Its First Class in Name Only, You only get some perks!","The connecting flight out of Ottawa UA4910 is a regional jet that connects to UA778 through Dulles, Washington. It only has Premium Economy/Economy Seats. I selected a Premium Economy Seat, but ended up in boarding zone 4. I was able to check my Bag for Free. As I had time on the ground in Dulles I attempted to go in the Lounge before departure, but was turned away with my First Class Boarding Pass because I had connected from Premium Economy on an International Flight. The seats and beverage service on board 778 was quite good, but the only difference between us and Economy for snacks was we could select more than one and a banana was an option. So even though we flew over lunchtime our flight was less than 2hrs 20 min so we only got assorted snacks. They probably should have pulled a curtain across when they served the pilots their hot meals and they snacked on an assortment of cheeses! Both Flights arrived early so that was a plus!"
Dec 2019,10,Dr,United always has maintenance problems. I will Never fly them again. They need to do a better job of preventive maintenance.
Dec 2019,40,The Friendly Skies,"Friendly, competent service that provided - to our surprise - the full entertainment package, with the ear-buds included at no charge."
Dec 2019,50,A flight home,"This was a very special trip, my wife reached the 1 million mile level for her time flying with United when we were about half way over the Gulf of Mexicon. The lead flight attendant came and thanked her for her loyalty and congratulated her."
Dec 2019,50,Nice short flight,"This was a fairly short trip, about 2 hours. Flight attendants were nice, food in first was ok. The plane was clean and everything seemed to be working properly."
Dec 2019,30,"The flights were on time, the flight crew were good",We traveled from BISMARCK TO Telaviv for a tour. The flights were on time and our luggage made there and back without getting lost.
Dec 2019,50,Sincere service,"Thanks to Carla, Nakia and Larry, I can successfully check in. I am Chinese and my English is not very good. So I didn't know how to check in. They helped me with great patience and I was really grateful for that! They are so considerate and zealous that I really want to leave comment for them"
Dec 2019,10,Basic Economy on United sucks!,I am flying basic economy on United for the first and last time. I’m going for a quick solo weekend trip and didn’t need to check a bag or so I thought. I had a backpack with my laptop and a small weekend bag. I took the same Items a few months ago. Both fit under the seat. Last time I flew I had my son with me and couldn’t fly basic because basic also does not allow you to sit with your family or choose your seats without agreeing to check a bag. Now that I have to pay to check my tiny overnight bag the money I saved with Basic economy on this flight is now equal to the next level of ticket. The flight isn’t even full. Oh and you have to board in group 5. United Basic Economy sucks big time.
Dec 2019,30,Better Than They Used to Be - Much More Organized,"This year United finally was properly staffed at LAX and PIT for the Thanksgiving rush. For our flights the planes were full, but the lines for ticketing, baggage check-in, and TSA were minimal. The boarding areas were still crowded, but not absurdly so.    Our flight from IAD to PIT was two hours late, but there are now wide screen monitors giving status and an explanation. No more having gate attendants on poor public address systems saying that they don't know why your flight was delayed."
Dec 2019,50,Peaceful,"Wifey and I booked an award ticket LAX-EWR on the 12:05am departure in Business Class.    1. This route has the lie-flat seats in business class and adds so much to the value on an overnight transcon flight. Out 757-200 had the ex-Continental seats that while a bit worn, are extremely comfortable.  2. Flight attendants were OK. Nothing spectacular, but not rude by any means. Keep in mind that most people were passed out anyway.  3. OTP - we departed LAX 24"" late due to late arriving aircraft, but still arrived in EWR 3"" early.  4. Only a small snack is offered. Our choices were either a Calzone with grapes or a salad. We both had the calzone and they've were tasty. Flights at other times of the day have larger meals, but since 2/3 of the cabin turned the snack down in exchange for more rest, this was sufficent.  5. IFE - Fair to Good. Various movies, TV shows, etc. Most people bring their own entertainment on an iPad or laptop anyway.  6. Wifi - This 757-200 uses the Gogo wifi. While not blazing, it worked well for simple email, iMessage, and even webpages.  7. Legroom - not an issue since there were lie-flat seats. Tip: Rows 1 and 5 have larger and deeper footwells that enable a taller person to lie in the flat position easier.  8. Price - while this was an award trip for us, the cash price when we booked was about $1,000 per person.    Conclusion: You get what you pay for. I took a walk to the back galley mid-flight and everyone in coach looked miserable, and this was quite enjoyable. Personally, it's the right way to go if you have the disposable cash, but not worth getting into debt over. YMMV"
Dec 2019,40,We like Uniteds International service,"We prefer taking non stop flights whenever we fly to Europe We live in Central Pa and drive to Newark because parking at Newark Long Term parking is a breeze and we can get nonstops. The only problem I have with Uniteds international service is that they are now playing the assigned seat and baggage charges game that make comparing tougher. We usually start looking to book 3 to 4 months ahead of time and watch airfares since they change regularly. Once we book the flight we then watch the Premium Economy fees since they also change up and down. We do feel the additional cost of Premium Economy is worth it. We just booked late April to Malpensa and upgraded to premium economy both ways. We have flown United from Newark to Brussels, Munich, Geneva, Zurich and Milan many times and the flights have been good on 767-400ER's that have 2-3-2 cabin seating"
Dec 2019,20,First Class??,I just started booking my tickets first class if I take any flight over 2 hours long. I’m not that guy who needs first class but the bigger seats and being in the front help me deal with my claustrophobia. I have flown Delta and United and have to say Delta wins hands down.    I recently flew to Punta Cana as it is one of our favorite spots. We took United due to the fare and the flying schedule. I think I’ll pay a little extra for Delta. The flight down wasn’t not that bad but the beverage service was horrible. I wasn’t expecting a private bar but I couldn’t get more than a 1/2 glass of OJ. I wasn’t trying to get loaded at 6 am but I was wide awake and eXpected more. The plane was old but it was still comfortable.    The flight back was more of the same but there was no entertainment....not even a drop down screen. Had I known I would have downloaded movies on my iPad like I used to do. I don’t mind using my own devices big I was paying for better service and better atmosphere.
Dec 2019,50,No complaints on this flight,"Smooth flight. There was no delays or issues with my luggage. The flight attendant service was good and although my seats were not assigned until I was at the gate, i was given seat with great leg room so i was satisfied."
Dec 2019,10,new low for United: bring your own water,"during service, requested the flight attendant if she could fill my 24oz bottle of water as I need more than the standard cup (6oz) because of health reasons, which she denied citing that the policy is each passengers gets 2 cups per service and no more. WATER. Thankfully, my seat neighbors, hearing the situation, stepped up and requested their water and shared it with me.    The flight attendant refused to share her name. Issued a complain to customer service, and got the advice that next time to call ahead of time to share health issues upfront, confirming that it is indeed a policy.    Never had an issue with other airlines, even if its the policy, what type of person can you by to deny WATER?"
Dec 2019,50,Trip was awesome,"The flight was 17 hours, but really did not feel that long. The premium economy was definitely worth the price (we paid about $200 extra each way). The additional leg room and the fact that only 2 people sat in a row with three seats was very helpful. Economy was totally full and the legroom was about 6 inches less. We flew home into San Fran and it took 13 hours and felt much longer than the 17 hour flight."
Dec 2019,40,Economy Plus - well worth it,"We had the Economy Plus 4 middle seats right behind the bulkhead. There was sufficient space to walk between the seats and the bulkhead with out disturbing the others. The enhanced service, while not great, was appreciated. The enhanced snacks had a good variety.The meal was meh! skimpy, starchy, tasteless. The ice cream dessert was appreciated. This was not one of the newly remodeled planes for international travel that United is touting in its ads, but the seats were OK - not ht etorture chanbers we have had on previous United international flights."
Dec 2019,40,The flight was early,"I was pleased to note they did not skimp on snacks. We did pay for our bags and did not have a large carry-on. The flight was pleasant and fast, both ways. I was impressed."
Dec 2019,50,Work I Dallas,I have been flying with United for business now for 5 years. I flew international to China then home every 30 days. I have found a United to be tops on customer service. They have always treated me well. The flight to Dallas was their usual great service. Loaded on time left on time plane was clean and comfortable. I will continue to use United for my flights.
Dec 2019,50,Good flight,Flight was on time and as comfortable me as economy can be. Staff were very friendly. I have flown United several times and am always satisfied
Dec 2019,30,Need to Modernize and Increase Leg Room,"I fly this route often, and took United this time (and not again) due to scheduling matters. For a much higher price than coach, I got very little additional leg room (maybe an inch or two), a dated entertainment system that kept having to be rebooted, and mediocre service. Sorry United, Delta (and even American) have better service on this route."
Dec 2019,40,Better Flight Back !!,Flight was pushed by Jet Stream and we landed about 30 minutes EARLY. Captian said He expected a rough time due to weather. We didnot have a dip or drop the whole way. Very quiet flight.
Dec 2019,40,"Direct, non-stop is the only way to go.","Flight was a cakewalk. We arrived just ahead of 11"" of snow! We had about 15 children on board. They were great, no noise no crying no running. Crew was very good. Takeoff and landing was one of the best I have ever had. We will take the same flight again on our next trip to the Rockies."
Dec 2019,10,Terrible Airline,"I have flown with United four times within the past year and every time has been a nightmare. Every single flight has either been delayed prior to boarding, delayed due to technical difficulties after boarding, or changed in some way. No flight that I have flown with them within the past year has been easy or as planned. I will  never fly with United again."
Dec 2019,50,vegas visit,"original flight changed from Denver CO to Newark NJ due to weather, a little turbulence; otherwise, flight was okay"
Dec 2019,50,flight to Chicago for Thanksgiving,Excellent crew and captain. smooth flight with snacks and beverages. Very friendly and courteous. We ran into weather conditions but were immediately spoken to about the conditions and told how and when we could expect conditions to lift. We had a packed plane and the attendants very efficiently assisted with luggage and carry-on bags to ensure all were with their owners. Flight was on time with its departure and we landed on schedule. Very smooth transition out of the airport into an uber to our hotel.
Dec 2019,20,Amazing! We got there!,"If an airline could care less about their passengers, United Airlines comes in first. From the baggage check-in to the arrival in Denver, the trip was filled with rudeness. I have over 2 million miles of business and leisure travel on over 20 different airlines and seldom have I experienced such indifference towards the passengers by the gate agents and the flight attendants. When I book flights now, I exclude United Airlines."
Dec 2019,40,Round Trip for Knoxville to Houston,Overall good flight. Left an hour late from Knoxville due to crew arriving late the night before due to bad weather. Flight home was on-time and quick. Service was friendly and helpful.
Dec 2019,30,Economy class,Flight was 90 percent full.  I had ordered Asian vegetarian meal. I got mildly flavored chickpeas with 1/2 whole wheat tortilla And wheat farina upma. Food was fair. I have had better aircraft food with Qatar air and Lufthansa. Six hours later a snack consisting of date nut bar and a whole bread roll veggie sandwich. Meh!  There were not many snack options if you were hungry to walk back and get something. Staff interaction was okay. Not personable.  They had a handicap accessible bathroom. Wish it was labeled like that.  Overall Fair flight.
Dec 2019,30,"No overhead bin space if you're late, is a myth!","We arrived late at our gate. Group 4 was boarding when we got there and we were in group 2.  The gate agent said no more overhead bin space and forced us to check our carry on.  Because we were late , so we complied. I thought to myself;"" that it is a big air craft, why no overhead bin space for all!!??"". When we got to our seat, the overhead bins above our seats were empty!! You can understand my frustration, because snacks and what not to make us comfy was in our carry on. Point is, gate agents should check with cabin crew before putting passengers at unnecessary inconvenience! So, my advice is, do not listen to gate agents especially when you are in premium economy or higher, doesn't matter if you arrive late. The overhead bin by your seat is yours, and should be reserved for you! When is a long flight bring your luggage with you inside , never check it. You will be very uncomfortable when you need things like a blanket, scarf, puzzle book etc. on a long flight.Cabin crew and flight attendance need to do their job to make the passengers comfortable and not cutting corners on their responsibility. I understand group 5 should not bring carry on, but the rest is allowed, so make sure everyone that pay for that should be able to bring their stuff on board."
Dec 2019,10,Chicken Bus of the Sky,"Worst airlines in the world. I should have learned my lesson years ago to pay a little more than ride with these fools. They lie about maintenance issues while they keep you on the plane for hours. Their excuses on the plane do not match the emails sent as you wait. They run out of water by row 38. They ruin your luggage. They strand you without compensation. This old dog has finally learned her lesson - NEVER, EVER, fly United!"
Dec 2019,10,Too many issues,"I'm about to go on a small rant so please, bare with me.  On December 5 2019, I got to the airport at 10:30am for my 12:40pm flight with United Airlines flight #UA6078 from Toronto to San Antonio with a Houston layover. Checked in, boarded the plane, sat down, buckled up the whole nine yards. The aircraft pushed back from the gate at 12:38pm, taxied to get de-iced, I thought it was a little weird as it wasn’t as cold. After about 20mins and a colourful wash, I realized we were just going in circles. At 1:20pm I saw us heading back to the gate, I've now been on this aircraft around 40 mins doing circles on the tarmac, no announcements made as to why we were still on the ground. When we finally parked at the gate, the captain came on saying the second engine would not start and they have called for maintenance and we should 'bare with them a minute' I've already bared 50 mins but who's counting. Around 1:50pm or so we are told maintenance has arrived and has determined that they are unable to fix the issue and so we will have to disembark. The flight attendants didn’t seem very concerned at all, after all, they were already where they needed to be.    At 2:20pm while still on the aircraft, I got on the phone with United customer service, spoke with a nice girl, she was polite and apologetic, after 30 minutes, she came back with 1 option and that was an Air Canada flight for 8:15pm to Houston, she said I would have to wait until Friday to get to San Antonio as the last flight out of Houston to there was at 8PM. This was unacceptable as I had to be at my cousins’ graduation at 9AM. At this point I was so frustrated, tired and hungry. I told her to book it, only because I had spoken to my cousins and they were willing to drive over 3 hours to Houston to pick me up. She offered no compensation at all, I thanked her for her help and hung up.    I stood in line waiting for the agents that were sent to assist us while on the phone with her, just to see if there were any better options, one where I wouldn’t have to inconvenience my family. It took almost 3 hours to get to the front of the line, I have now been at YYZ for over 6 hours. Once I got to the agent, instead of being greeted with consideration and understanding, I was greeted with attitude, as if the cause of the cancellation was my mine. The agent seemed as if we were all bothering her, she wasn't pleasant at all. Though I was already booked on Air Canada, through my own doing, I checked and saw that American Airlines had 2 flights out at 6:29pm, I asked if I could get on either flight as they both were going to Dallas then on to San Antonio, her reply was 'we don't have affiliations with American"". She was not helpful at all, she never gave any suggestions, or recommendations. Throughout our entire interaction she kept sighing, and basically rolling her eyes. She advised my only options were to do the whole flight tomorrow (December 6) or stay over in Houston. I advised her neither of those were good options. I really did not want to deal with her anymore and so I told her I would keep the Air Canada flight.    While I am extremely grateful the engine did not fail while in the air and that the captain chose to stay on ground instead of risking our lives, there are ways to make a bad situation better and good customer service along with communication would have been one of those ways.  Absolutely no compensation was offered, i spent over 10 hours at the airport, only to wait for a flight that was not even going to my destination, I felt awful having to put my family out their way – who by the way were awake since 4am for their flights.    As if all that was not bad enough, on the way back home on December 9th the flight out of San Antonio UA1930 - was delayed, about 15 – 20 minutes, my layover in Houston was only 51 mins, my initial thought was here we go again! Luckily, I got to Houston while the flight to Toronto – UA2420 was boarding, it pushed back a little late, and it also sat out on the tarmac/runway for about an hour due to ‘maintenance’. The good thing is they were able to fix whatever issue this was.    I've been traveling since I was 7 years old, this was my very first time flying with United and I will never travel with them again! I’m aware things can happen, aircrafts are machines and can have problems, but having issues on both my outgoing and return flights was too much for me, in addition, the lack of care and respect for time was appalling. People however, are not machines and having someone who showed a bit of understanding and care for the passengers would have made all the difference. I was not able to get any names, the agent in Toronto was not wearing a name tag and frankly I didn’t care to ask what her name was. I don’t believe she is employed directly by United, possibly by the 3rd party handler Global. I highly suggest you do regular training with your employees and people who represent your brand. If customer service is important to your brand it was a total miss on this occasion."
Dec 2019,40,wedding flightto PA,"The flight was slightly late departing due to air traffic incoming to Chicago, however, the crew made up some time during our flight to Harrisburg. The flight attendants were efficient and professional. The aircraft was spotlessly clean and organised. My only negative comment for this trip was the cost to fly."
Dec 2019,50,Graet company,Great flight from point to point with no delays and great service. Any chance I get I would fly United at this time.
Dec 2019,40,Delays into Newark,"Great flight , except for delays due to weather in Newark. Great flight otherwise . Will fly on United again."
Dec 2019,10,Horrible Experience,"I was a part of a group flight through my University traveling from Madrid to Newark after spending 4 months studying abroad in Madrid. Apparently, for United Airlines, it is up to the employee's discretion whether or not they want to charge you for an overweight suitcase. While I was charged 200$ for a suitcase that was 2 kilos overweight, there were other students that had suitcases that were overweight by 5+ kilos and they were not charged. This is a disgrace and discrimination. When I contacted customer service the woman brushed me off and said there was nothing she could do for me. I will never fly this airline again."
Dec 2019,50,Mexico Trip,"Very nice, very comfortable service was good flight safely arrived on time. the United Airline team was very nice through the whole process."
Dec 2019,50,Excellent Round Trip from Dulles to Cancun,"An Excellent Round Trip from Dulles to Cancun. The flights were on time and the services were good. This was a great improvement since I flew with United Airline, a few round trips to Cancun, a few years back. The previous trips always 2-3 hours delay at Cancun airport on top of 3 hours that we had to arrive early at the airport. This time we were not disappointed, keep up the good work United Airline"
Dec 2019,50,Flight to Aruba,Flight was smooth and on time. They quickly loaded the plane and stewardess were very friendly. We enjoyed actually talking with the young couple sitting near us.
Dec 2019,40,Good flight but mistakes in scheduling,There were long delays on nearly every flight but the actual flying time was pleasant. Nothing was bad enough to cause not using United again.
Dec 2019,30,Refreshing Needed,"This flight was on an older 737. It departed on schedule and arrived on schedule. The flight was packed and people were shoving items in overhead compartments that weren’t even close to where they were sitting. The business class seats barely recline and the choices of entertainment videos seemed to be catered to a teenage girl. The staff was courteous and the food was “airline food”. If I go back to Trinidad, I may try a different route next time to avoid this flight."
Dec 2019,50,Extremely Pleasant,"Departed Dulles on time headed to Tel Aviv and had an extremely pleasant experience from start to finish.My seat was the last one in business,tucked in the corner,cozy and private.As I was settling in a flight attendant approached and inquired as to my beverage choice? I asked for a mimosa and it was perfectly prepared,prompting me to go another!I watched one good movie and enjoyed a delicious dinner before having my bed made including a mattress pad and a real pillow,wow. I actually slept well and awoke to chilled tomato juice and yes I had another in addition to wonderful fresh coffee and a decent breakfast.  This was honestly one of the most enjoyable overnight international flights in memory."
Dec 2019,40,Pleasant way to fly Direct to Dallas/Fort Worth,"This direct flight was perfect for us, but really quite the economy experience, given we had to buy our own sandwiches to bring aboard, or buy a crummy microwaved cheeseburger made yesterday or cookies or pretzels aboard. Of course we opted for ToGo's carryout. There was no movie unless you thought ahead to download the United App so you could watch movies on your postage-sized iPhone screen, ha ha. Other than that, it wasn't very expensive because we purchased the tickets WAY ahead."
Dec 2019,50,United USA,"Flew United Airlines to New York. Fabulous company to fly with. The staff were great. My daughter requires a gluten free menu which was provided with no fuss or bother. The flight staff were so attentive, caring professional etc. Would definitely chose them again and would definitely recommend them to anyone who was thinking of flying United Airlines."
Dec 2019,40,Very busy flight before Rosh Hashana,Great company with pleasant staff.  Try not to catch a flight to Israel before Rosh Hashana or Yom Kipur.  The plane was full and there wasn't enough space for languages in the cabin. That made a delay.
Dec 2019,20,"No Follow-up, no responsibility,","I started a trip from Montana to L.A. and had multiple setbacks along the way. Our departure was delayed partly due to a sick passenger and also from a fear of the fog. Regardless many of us missed our connecting flights in Denver, including myself and while on board United assured us that they were doing EVERYTHING possible to assure a quick resolution to any disruptions. I ran to my gate and missed my flight by minutes. At that point a United employee told myself and several others from our flight that we were booked on the next flight to L.A., grab some lunch, hang out and you'll be on your way. So I went to the gate where the next flight was going out of, couldn't find anyone and assumed that they had indeed booked us on the next flight, got some lunch made some calls and waited. I went back to the gate at least 45 minutes prior to departure only to find out that they had no record of me on that flight. I was put on standby, but of course the flight was overbooked, so I waited another 2+ hours for the next flight! I went to talk and complain about this obvious lack of follow-up, only to be shuffled through three different United employees which in the end the supervisor said she would give me a $75 voucher for another flight in the future. That seemed pretty pathetic for moving my arrival back 6 hours later and causing me to be significantly late for my conference. The voucher was to be sent to my email. NOTHING now nearly a week later. They said they moved my flight to the next one, WRONG, said I would be given a voucher, WRONG!! And the all the while not one single employee had any empathy or took any responsibility for derailing travel plans. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND UNITED AGAIN!!"
Dec 2019,20,‘Colder’ skies with UA,"I regularly fly between Europe and the US. Comparing my flight experience over the last year between United and Delta, there still is a marked difference between both airlines, not so much in terms of plane entertainment, available space, cleanliness, ease of checking in, etc. What makes a marked difference is the outspoken friendliness of Delta (and KLM) flight attendants, who do a great job of making you feel welcome. United keeps on feeling ‘colder’ in 2019, notwithstanding all efforts of the company. Hopefully better next year United."
Dec 2019,50,Great flight to enjoy a week in FL,"Our flight was on time; checkin bag, efficient & courteous; aircraft, clean, comfortable; service crew, very pleasant, professional, & efficient; take off & landing, easy & safely done; arrival, 10 minutes, early on both legs of journey. Perfect! :)"
Dec 2019,30,Their policy that their domestic flights don't serve meals.,"From San Francisco to Honolulu (about 8 hours flight) No meals because of their policy no meals on domestic flight. From Honolulu to Agana Guam, (about 5 hours) still no meals because still domestic flight. It was only from Agana to Manila (4 hours) where they served meals because it is international flight. Worse, is that in Honolulu and Guam, there was no decent restaurant at their airports. It was a horrible flight for my wife and me. I am a diabetic so you must know what I am talking about."
Dec 2019,40,Maintenance and Flight Crew First,"The most vital element of flight is the Aircrew. This is followed by the maintenance. Consumers are rarely so informed, or asked. United Airlines were selected by the U. S. Air Force to train their flight crews. But the United Airlines flight crews are largely veterans of the American MILITARY FLY ING SERVICES. It's wondeerful to look at beautiful, yo ung, Cabin Attendants durintg a flight, but let a mountain appear, and all the beauty is meaningless."
Dec 2019,50,Only problem was with the gate,"I seldom have a complaint about United. My complaint is with some of the gate people. On a recent flight, I accidentally dropped my credit card on the plane. It was found and turned in (thankful for honest people) but, unfortunately, I had already made my way all the way from C5 to B17 in another terminal before I was paged. There was no way I had time to return to the previous gate and still make my flight. I asked if it might be possible for someone to bring it to my gate on a cart. No. They said they were sure it would be mailed (FedEx even) to my home. Not only did that never happen, but to this day, I still have not received my credit card back. After reporting it 'lost' online and exchanging several emails that were 'lip service' only, I gave up and cancelled the card. No one seemed to care, and put forth no effort whatsoever to mail the card back to me. They just continued to say: We have not found your missing item, and will continue looking for 30-days, and then your request will be closed."" It was not lost. I told them exactly where the card was, yet no one would make the effort to do anything about it. Whatever happened to customer service with a smile? Frustrating."
Dec 2019,10,Atrociaous Cust Svc in Chicago,"AWFUL!!! Not only have all of our flights out of Syracuse been delayed due to mechanical difficulties, the customer service people in connecting airports are atrocious. We tell them, ""we know it's not personal, but your represent the airline"", these inexperienced ""managers"" are terrible. Chicago, O'Hare United: AWFUL!!!"
Dec 2019,40,Flight 363 12/9/19 to Hawaii,Flying to & from Honotutu from / to Newark is always a long flight and United has it down pretty good. Sometimes the crew could be a bit more attentive especially as there usually always first time visitors to the islands. Overall a good job.
Dec 2019,30,Trip from KC to Denver during Thanksgiving week.,"Quick trip of around 90 minutes. Left on time and arrived as needed. Wheel chair was waiting for us when we cleared the plane.    Return trip on December 1 was delayed by several hours....supposedly due to poor weather in California....where the plan originated from. Consequently, we arrived in KC 90+ minutes late. Sitting in the airport waiting for the flight was boring as hell but United brought out some bottles of water and some of their typical snack items....so they were trying!"
Dec 2019,40,Good trip,"Good flight. Easy boarding, good service. Flight a little bumpy due to weather but on time departure and arrival"
Dec 2019,30,Very Pleasant Flight,"Flying UA for years and a 1K Premium member. Only issue I have is when will they fix their wi-fi service once and for all. It is not consistent in the planes, sometimes stops in the middle of a movie, sometimes you can't hear any sound and not all flights have the chargers blow the seats. I always have to ask for a reimbursement for the lack of service."
Dec 2019,40,"Trip to Goa, India","This was a first time international trip for spouse while flying overseas, so initially booked premium economy on all legs. (IAH to EWR, EWR to BOM, return, BOM to YYZ, YYZ to IAH). after booking upgraded to first on 1st leg (IAH to EWR) and YYZ to IAH. During the few months prior to trip, I kept an eye on weekly bases on the Polaris upgrade from EWR to BOM which by the way is a 16 hour plus flight. upgrade fluctuated between 2k plus to 7K plus each. a few weeks out before day of departure, the seat upgrades were available for $699 each. ( I immediately upgraded both our seats for the IAH to BOM leg) and surprised spouse on embarkation.. It was a great flight and she really enjoyed the POLARIS experience. overall flight experience on united was excellent on this trip."
Dec 2019,50,Going to Denver!,"I love to tralvel and a trip to Denver seemed just the place to see crisp mountains and feel the fresh air! As always, our flight went without a hitch-from checking in at OKC to walking into the Denver airport. United Airlines treats us the way we expect to be treated for there are a number of choices even flying economy!"
Dec 2019,20,Shivering With Cold (With Jacket On) - Suffering Surly Service - Awful Food,"DELIBERATE PREMEDITATED DISCOMFORT: I have flown United internationally for over three decades. There is slight improvement. At least on Asian routes the staff are no longer gratuitously rude. But the level of indifference towards passengers is manifested in not responding to call buttons (actually turning them off), and in the freezing temperature (which the attendants do not notice because they are moving around) and which they refuse to increase. The cushioning on the seats has been reduced below minimum so that the metal bar under my thighs hurt (remember this was a 15 hour flight).    A DOWNWARD SPIRAL OF LOW FARES AND CUTTING THINGS TO THE BONE (literally): There is ferocious competition, granted -- with airlines in a downward spiral of cutting costs and services. My flight from Newark to Singapore (round trip) was dirt cheap -- cheaper than some NJ - California fares.    IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO COMPETE? But imagine how United could charge a bit more for tickets if they spent 50 cents more per meal (currently worse than awful), or insisted their staff respond to call buttons, or upped the thermostat to make passengers more comfortable, or added one-half inch to the padding over the seats. Simple stuff -- not all of which takes a lot of money.    But it does take imagination and some degree of care, which is lacking.    Imagine also what would happen if United's management insisted that their executives had to fly economy. Currently they fly First or Business and so have little empathy or knowledge about the cattle class conditions."
Dec 2019,50,New seats provide more legroom. Yay!,"Tampa is my favorite airport with a great design for passenger movement. TSA inspection was swift. Seating is comfortable at gates. No issues with seating or space for carry-on bag, especially with benefits as a United Credit Card holder.  Flight was smooth and on-time.  The new seats seem thinner and maybe have a different angle. They were comfortable and provided a noticeable increase in legroom which I liked."
Dec 2019,50,san fransisco to Vancouver flight,"The flight was of short duration and was comfortable. However, no advance information was given about transit Visa requirement for Canada in advance which resulted in anxius movement as the ETA had to obtained before boarding pass could be obtained at the nick of time, which is a difficult proposition for a visiting person"
Dec 2019,30,First class may have been worth the cost almost,In the fall and winter lots of problems can happen with flights so I try to book direct flights. I look for larger planes as I think most do. Picking not the most desireable time for the flights brought first a lot closer to coach. I did not pay double coach and got a nice unit to sit in on the long flight. Great service and good food. Everything happened on time. Actually it was what we all expect from every flight. Kudo's to the Captain who came out into first told us about the crew and what to expect for the flight. He added a personal touch by writing me a note on the back of his business card. Little touch not necessary but did make me feel appreciated for spending the money.
Dec 2019,10,"Fly only direct with United Airlines, huge frustration if expecting to make a connecting flight","Flying Nov 30 and flight delayed and delayed. Stewardesses and first officer waiting with passengers but no captain to pilot the flight to San Francisco. Had to wait for a pilot to be flown FROM San Francisco to fly our plane TO San Francisco. Assurance was given that we could still make connecting flight to Vancouver and yes we could have if there was enough ground drew to direct our plane the short distance from the runway into our disembarking slip F7. Our connecting flight was in slip F6 and was waiting for us in slip F6. As we were sitting by the window on the left hand side of the plane we could view the connecting plane right next to us, waiting. Well after about 15 minutes the connecting flight pulled the luggage belt and flew off without us. We sat on the tarmack for nearly 1/2 hour watching everything.  Customer Service folks were able to get us on the next flight out but that was delayed and delayed and delayed. On top of that we again sat on the tarmac as the plane was unable to leave due to a windshield wiper not working. We waited for the part to arrive and then were told a new part was not needed, something was wrong with the tension of the wiper.  We left our place in Phoenix at 9 am and arrived home in Canada at 2.30 am. The check-in/boarding staff and flight crew were very obliging and tried their best, My quibble is not with them at all but the organizing /system of United Airlines. We felt they were very understaffed. While waiting in the airports we noted many flight crew waiting around in the food court and in the sitting lounges ....waiting and waiting too.  This has been our 3rd experience of flying with United and then trying to make a connecting flight. Not once have me made the connection.Sorry United but that is no longer acceptable."
Dec 2019,40,Value for money flight,"Flew to Kona, Big Island from SFO in United. Was great flight for the money. Both the flight were on time and had no delays. Service and entertainment options was okay."
Dec 2019,50,United Round trip ATL-SFO,"Even though our first flight was cancelled due to weather, the CS team did a great job getting us to our destination.    You are taking a gamble if you choose basic economy, they tell you the cons of basic when purchasing the ticket. We pretty much lost on the way bc we could not make any changes even to the canceled flight. They rescheduled us and we had no say or option for another flight. We ended up missing a sight seeing tour bc the flight scheduled for us arrived after the tour (not UA fault). We did end up winning on the way back bc the plane had too much weight in the back so they moved us to the premium economy seats that had more leg room.    The flight itself was cool. I slept the whole time both ways so I can’t give any detail to the on board experience.    I will definitely fly UA again."
Dec 2019,40,Winter Travel,"It was the first time in 31 years that I traveled home to Germany around Christmas. The flight had reduced service due to some complications so the staff was two people short. Add to it an almost two hour delay before take off due to weather and it could’ve been the start to a toxic trip. However, people were civilized, staff gave their best, and all went well. A strike at the Frankfurt airport also forced the airline to load all the food for the return flight back to the states so due to load we had to give up some food items. I was impressed how mellow everyone reacted, making it a pleasant experience. Well done. I do miss the more comfy pillows from past days and wonder about ways to reduce waste."
Dec 2019,40,You get what you pay for,"We flew the Monday before Thanksgiving and returned the day after. We took a 6AM flight, and avoided the crowds. We breezed through security and had a very good experience both ways. The entertainment going was on my iPad, using the United app. The Fort Myers Airport was easy to navigate, and Enterprise car rental was the best I have ever experienced."
Dec 2019,50,The friendly skies,Great overall service and a easy and quick flight to Puerto Vallarta! The plane was clean and friendly.
Dec 2019,40,All was good..,All was good from baggage check-in..counter...security..gate all was good. United Club still excellent..
Dec 2019,10,Organization Nightmare,"After a 24 hour delay for a flight to Frankfurt do to technical difficulties with the landing gear of the plane we were told that United would provide hotels and meal vouchers. After taking the shuttle bus from the airport to Crown Plaza Hotel, in Newark about 15 min away from Newark International Airport, the hotel concierges were put in a terrible situation. We were told by United we had rooms, however they never confirmed with the hotel and the hotel was actually overbooked for the night. After they were on the phone with United for over an hour, the hotel was kind enough to overbook their hotel for us. Exhausted and tired, I was thankful for their kindness. Fast forward to next day, de ja vu, United switched the gates twice without changing the gate number on the monitors. People are at two different gates, and confused. After telling customer services people don't know where to go they said that they will announce it on the overhead- it is almost impossible to understand all of this information changing and if there are contradictory information in multiple places it makes people upset. I feel bad for the staff who works for United because they clearly do not have enough organizational support and structure from this company that is clearly falling apart at the seams. I don't normally write reviews and I don't like to be overtly negative, but if people pay good money for something that does not function properly they should know what they could be getting themselves into."
Dec 2019,30,Round trip IAD to Orlando,"mixed review here. Seatback entertainment not working on the flight to Orlando. Crew seemed indifferent but, it was a late evening flight . Seatback stated a power outlet was available but, I could not find it. I had my Fire and it was charged a ready to go offline so I did not bother the crew. Crew on the return flight was very nice, smiling, offering assistance, the seatback worked and there was a power outlet. (I don't think there was one on the first flight).  Typical for United, room in the aisle was very limited. I arrived at my destinations safely and on time without any doubt that it would happen."
Dec 2019,50,Excellent flights to Bristol via Chicago and Dublin,No delays/problems flying with United Airlines and Aer Lingus  Helpful ground staff and aircrew  Can recommend using the shuttle bus at Chicago to get from one terminal to another thereby avoiding to go  through security a second time
Dec 2019,10,Our flight was cancelled & nobody helped!,"The first UAL agent said that they would pay for an overnight if we couldn't get out that day, Then he disappeared & THE 2nd UAL agent said they wouldn't;t pay for an overnight because it was caused by weather--not UA;s fault. This was our 2nd United flight in 6 weeks that had trouble. I'm not going to book with them anymore---if I can help it.."
Dec 2019,10,First class but hour long line to checkin,My third United flight in 2 months. The pilots and stewards are great. Newark is a nightmare. I’ll NEVER use United again. Kiss my ass. Spent money for poor service
Dec 2019,40,A good rating even though I arrived a day later than planned. United was very supportive with meals vouchers plus hotel.,Mechanical problems on my first flight resulted in a day late at my destination. United Airlines was very accommodating with meals and hotel costs.
Dec 2019,30,"Was disappointed no food available to purchase, however our reservations said it was.","Was a 4 hour flight over lunch time but no meals were available to purchase. Having to leave our house at 6:00 am to get to airport, park and take shuttle to Terminal, get checked in etc. there was no time to eat at airport and food was suppose to be available to purchase but wasn't. Don't know how you are suppose to know it is not available when it is said it would be. Very long day without anything to eat except pretzels."
Dec 2019,40,Great flight crews - friendly and eager to please.,"There have been issues with United in the past - but since Oscar Munoz took over, what a turnaround! It seems that everyone is happier, and it shows in the service at the counter and on the plane. Kudos to United for the improvement!"
Dec 2019,10,Greedy airline,"They made us pay $60 for carry ons, when other passengers just walked in the plane with theirs. Airplane was not full. Many empty seats, but they wouldn't let us change seats. Not very customer friendly. Will try my best not to fly with them again. American Airlines is much better."
Dec 2019,20,Terrible United Airlines,"Sent: Thu, Dec 5, 2019 at 7:36 AM    Subject: United airlines     I changed my destination location to get near where I wanted to go on the day I wanted to be there. had a green tag bag. Which I told I was to get at carousel 2 at the Providence airport. I along with all others waited 1.5 brs for our bags. No explanation. The girl in the baggage office disappeared. TSA agent tried to find out for us what was going on. She also struck out. What a crock and lack of customer service on United     Air. This isn't the first time I have not retrieving my baggage with UnitedI wonder how u stay in  business!    Also. In lving Knoxville,TN. The plane on Dec 3, left 2 hrs late. Again no explanation, no one knew. After 1hr told mechanical problem. Turned out one of toilets wouldn't stop flushing.     All toilets were shut off on the flight to Chicago: we had no restrooms. How does united stay in business!!!"
Dec 2019,40,United as usual,"Took a one stop flight SFO to San Jose Costa Rica, via Houston. The first flight was jammed and I was asked to check my carry-on as I was boarding in group 4 and my wife was in group 2. They took it at the gate and lucky for us took the baggage tag off in the jet way which was nice as I was boarding a boat in Costa Rica and it for some reason things went wrong, I would be on the ocean with no bags. Indeed one of the passengers did get her carry-on lost which was a bummer as it had some important stuff in it. They were offering up to $700 for volunteers but none came forward. I had to have my bag put in the very back of the plane when I was only in row 12 so waited until it emptied before being able to exit. A minor irritation though. At least there was in seat entertainment even though I had many movies downloaded onto my iPad. No other hiccups, easy otherwise. I have been flying United for 30 years but frequent flyer miles are almost worthless these days. Lucky my wife is still earning miles as a consultant."
Dec 2019,40,Nonstop to Japan,"We flew United nonstop to Osaka, Japan on a 787. We had reserved the Premier Economy seats, larger, more leg room. We felt comfortable and relaxed on our ten hour flight from SFO. Service was pleasant, we were quite happy with the quietness of the new 787 Dreamliner. Each seat also has its own screen with unlimited movies, TV shows, music, documentaries, and flight info. We flew United nonstop on our return trip from Osaka to SFO. Again happy with our 787."
Dec 2019,30,United Airlines,"For the basics with a comfortable flight, United often is the choice to make. No in-flight entertainment on this short (2-hour) domestic flight but access to charging personal devices. Old-""standard"" size tray tables in place provide plenty of area to set things down unlike those on newer planes (Spirit, Frontier, etc.) that are barely tiny shelves that barely hold a drink safely. A little more in price than the cheapest flights but with fewer ""hidden"" add-on charges for each and every category, and given the quality of seats, carry-on storage space, and both terminal and in-flight services, United is clearly a value for travel."
Dec 2019,10,Terrible customer service,"We were on our way to the airport when my partner received an email that our flight was cancelled due to ""unexpected maintenance"". As a result, we missed our connecting flight to New Zealand. We waited on hold for almost an hour and eventually got through to a representative who informed us they could not rebook us until the next day. As a result, we had to pay for an extra night's accommodation and missed a day of work.    The next day, we tried to explain the situation to a rep at Newark airport as we wanted to sit together in the plane and I had dietary requirements. She was extremely rude and told my partner to "" tell me something I don't already know "" when he explained that our flight had been cancelled the previous day and refused to order a gluten-free meal for me because she needed 48 hours notice to do so.    Our second flight to Houston was delayed by an hour and we nearly didn't make our connection yet again. The customer service rep informed us that we ""better run"" if we wanted to make it. We ended up sprinting across Houston airport. Although we made the plane, our luggage did not.    We have lodged a complaint with United Airlines but have not received a response. Please read and consider this before booking a flight with United!"
Dec 2019,20,Great Flight and Staff But.......,"I have done a lot of flying lately and I do a review whenever possible. However, is the airlines doing anything positive after reading any of the reviews or going over the numerous negative surveys? I think not. The staff on this flight was terrific. Polite and courteous while serving the swill the airlines call food. All boxed and not really fit for human consumption. The seats were unclean and the table trays were disgusting. Worst of all, seats being too close to the rear of the backrest in front of you and the fact that reclining two inches doesn't help. The padding of the seats is shameful. Why do airlines continue to insist on their customers being uncomfortable? Not much difference between American or United Airlines in this respect. I will be seriously considering another airline on my next trip."
Dec 2019,40,UA Flight,Flights on time. No issue with that. Issue with reduced space between seats is now at the ridiculous point.
Dec 2019,50,Our round-trip flight was EXCELLENT,The flight attendants were very professional and helpful. The whole crew was great. The snack was good as was the orange juice and water.
Dec 2019,10,Premier priced airline with discount service,United tried to be a premier airline but can’t even get the basics right. Late always. Crap service and premier status means nothing. Stay away if you can
Dec 2019,50,My oops!!!,"Imagine my astonishment this morning when I realized that I had booked a flight from Barcelona that are was 100% guaranteed that I could not make. Andrew, the agent who helped me book a new flight was supportive and totally customer focused. He searched multiple ways to fix the problem and came up with an excellent solution. In my opinion, he deserves a AAA+ rating. Kudos United Airlines and Andrew👏👏👏👏"
Dec 2019,20,No longer the friendly skies of United,"The staff from the gate agent to the attendants are ""professional"". They tow the corporate line and policies well. They do not look happy nor do they want to accommodate you. They have a job to do as evidenced by the pilot's comment as we approached Missoula. Thanks folks your way of travel is our way of living. Other airlines at least say thank you for flying with us. We hope to see you on a future flight. The aircraft smelt dirty. Inside (the web pocket in my seat had what looked like barf. The attendant did clean it while saying Oh it's probably just cookie crumbs. She had a hard time removing whatever it was. Several seats were broken - you could not move them back or forward. Upon disembarking a flight attendant and flight crew member simply said a meek goodbye. Again, other airline crews say goodbye. Have a good night/day. See you again. Perhaps the most offensive rule these days makes budget minded folks feel like scumbags. If you don't pay the extra money for the same seat you're sitting in then you can't select a seat nor can you bring a carry on like ""the richer people"". You humiliate your customers. As a matter of fact when boarding the gate agents announce over the speaker if you purchased a basic economy ticket you may not bring a carry on aboard. Hello... look at the low life. I've never been treated with such uncaring attitudes, rules and policies as you and your people demonstrate. While I may ""Have"" to fly United again; it will never be my first choice or any choice for that matter."
Dec 2019,30,United gates are at the end of each gate,Haven't flown UNited in quite awhile and will probably not fly them any time soon. Their gates are at the VERY end of each terminal. Know seats have been compressed to make more seats available but these seemed excessively tight. The crew was very good and tended to our needs in professional manner -- just don't like the looooonnnnng walk to their gates.
Dec 2019,40,Long but pleasant flight,"Comfortable business class seating. Food and drink was quite good. Nothing can make a 9 hour flight much fun, but the United Polaris service was pretty good."
Dec 2019,50,Amazing service,The ticket agent lady was extremely nice and helpful. We have not flown in awhile and never used United. When I mentioned my husband just had his knee replaced she immediately got him a wheelchair and a person to help. Even though we had cheapo tix and no seat assignment..he was first on the plane and given a seat with ample leg room and an aisle seat on the correct side for him to give his knee some extra room...they even put us together even though the plane was full
Dec 2019,50,Nice La Guardia to Denver Flight,"9:30 AM flight from LGA to DEN. Good breakfast/brunch selections in first class: protein plate (turkey, nuts, cheese, dried fruits, etc.) and a breakfast croissant sandwich. James gave great service."
Dec 2019,40,I was prepared for a miserable transatlantic flight but the Comfort Plus sections was wonderful,"I am an aisle sea fan. this seat was comfortable, had a movable arm rest and a foot rest, which was unexpected."
Dec 2019,30,Children under 7 should not be allowed in first class,Had a non-stop flight from Orlando to Cleveland...splurged for first class. There were 5 children under the age of 3 sitting in first class. The man behind me had his two year old sitting on his lap (instead of the empty seat next to him. The kid kicked my seat and yelled in my ear the entire flight. The only thing that drowned out his screaming was his grandmother sitting across the aisle with another baby. She was baby talking/screaming the entire flight. What a complete waste of money the upgrade was.
Dec 2019,50,United - Mexico City round trip Nov 2019,"Flight departed late but the airport was nice, got a burger and a coke. Flight was very comfortable, crew was helpful and courteous and pleasant. Did not check bags. Best part was the return, the flight was on time, the boarding process was orderly and staff were informative. I trust United to get me safely around the world."
Dec 2019,40,Uneventful Flight to Paradise,Good flight. On time. Boeing 737s are not the most comfortable aircraft(seats mainly) for flights over 2 hours. WiFi was not available on this flight ergo the poor Entertainment score.
Dec 2019,40,Flights on time,"Flights left on time, and a much better experience then our last United experience.  Giving htem a thumbs up this time!!!"
Dec 2019,10,one of the worst flights I have had to suffer,"cramped seats, rude flight crew, not a thing to eat or drink, if you wanted anything it ws going to cost you.    this airline puts passenger comfort right at the bottom of the pile.    unless you are in first class dont fly United."
Dec 2019,50,Good Flight,"It was a comfortable flight, good price, good service and very punctual. It´s what I expected for what we paid."
Dec 2019,30,Relax and learn,"During my latest trip to Mexico, I once again have to adjust to how the airlines handles documents needed upon arrival in Mexico.  Without fail, airlines used to hand out and be of assistance to those who needed help.  As U.S. citizens one must fill out Immigration and Declaration forms; this last trip I took, United had no forms, and we were told they would have them at the airport. This however adds about 30 to 40 mins to the process of arriving and getting on with your day. I do not know if the people in Authority in Mexico do not supply them with the forms or if the Airlines choose to not make that a priority;  This is quite an inconvenience to the relaxing mood one usually has when traveling.  Calling a Consulate or Airline will behoove me on my next trip, cause I just like having those documents ready when I land."
Dec 2019,10,Not what it used to be,"First, UA loads the plane from front to back rushes you to sit down so they can take off.Pulled away from gangway ,never made it to the runway and a red light appeared in cockpit, back to gangway for 1 1/2 house for generator repairs. Finally pulled away and were 10tenth on line for take off, another 1/2 hour delay. Landed in Phoenix , guess what? No dock , Another 1/2 hour. Got of gangway and it wasn't working . Everyone had to put back their carry ons back up , sit down, buckle up and be towed to another gangway. another 45 min. delay.  Airlines charging more for flights and customer recieving less service.  What happened to flying???????"
Dec 2019,30,"OK, not brilliant",Pretty ordinary service in a very cramped regional aircraft. Useless in flight wifi with no internet connection available.
Dec 2019,30,No Upgrade,"We have been flying United for more years than I care to remember. The trip to Barcelona was interesting to say the least. On the outbound leg, we had engine problems and after much delay and discussion, they cancelled and we spent another night in DC. The next day, our Business upgrade was gone and we were on a totally different flight. HOWEVER, they did manage to correct the situation and we had an enjoyable flight. Our return trip was terrible. When we booked the flight, almost at the beginning of their open period, we booked economy plus with expensive upgrade to business. Outbound, confirmed immediately. Homeward, no confirmation. When we checked our reservations, we were no longer sitting in an asile and window, but were moved to the center section. No reason was given. Trying to find a United Rep in Barcelona is nearly impossible. With priority boarding, we were able to skip the line and check our bags. When we got to the gate, the non-United clerks had no clue on how to check on our change of seating. There was MUCH confusion about getting us to the aircraft with a few other ""seasoned"" travelers, but they did manage to get us there before the doors closed. We found our ""seats"" and mentioned to the flight attendant our problems. She understood and kept the beverages refreshed. The rest of the flight was uneventful. Watched four recent movies before arriving in DC. SO, the bottom line, if you are flying to or through Barcelona... Be mindful..."
Dec 2019,50,Family cruise with Celebrity,"Flight was good, I travel a lot and can say only once was I  Disappointed with United. However, saying that more than once I was extremely pleased.  Will travel with United again."
Dec 2019,50,Trip to Italy,"They were on time and respectfully put pep in our steps to take off on time. They were attentive and walked around checking if we needed something to drink once the plane leveled off in the air. They didn't refuse if you needed something extra to drink after a snack like some airlines do. The staff was kind and didn't show any bad attitude as if they had somewhere better to be, so this airline was great."
Dec 2019,10,Worst flight ever,"We were made to board early and had to wait for a wheelchair. We were lucky to have enough space for carry on luggage. Within 15 minutes we were told the flight would be delayed due to problems with the landing gear. After another 20 minutes or so, we were made to depart the plane will our luggage. All told, our flight was delayed 3 hours. The only thing offered was water and pretzels in the airport. Had to wait again for wheelchair assistance. We were due to land at 10:15 and arrived at Phoenix airport at 1:50. Worst flight we have ever been on. Never again!"
Dec 2019,40,"Nice, smooth flight","The flight was quick, very smooth, and as expected. We were served drinks and those wonderful Biscoff cookies."
Dec 2019,30,A missed connection,"I received an email at about 0300 hours to say that the inbound flight was late by about 2 hours, due to mechanical failure and that I could miss my connect at Newark.  At Manchester this was confirmed and we were placed on a very late flight to Fort  Lauderdale.My daughter rang United and managed to get us on an earlier flight, but it took 2 and a half hours to sort out the paperwork, and we only just managed to get on board.We were given vouchers for a meal but we did not have time to us them.Also we received by email vouchers for a future flight in the next 12 months, but we may not use United again.So no compensation there then.On the whole a very stressful day and being in my eighties it took its toll."
Dec 2019,30,Long Flight,"Flight was pretty good, delay on leaving Syracuse. My wife and I didn't really care for the choice of food entree options. I choose the vegetarian option which wasn't too bad, but her's was a burger which didn't look to appetizing and she said it wasn't."
Dec 2019,20,Great value but no food to eat,"My daughter received special kid meals which were pre-ordered, but turned out all meals on both ways have eggs in it which she cannot eat. We asked if she can get a pasta meal provided for adult. It was a simple no meal cream sauce pasta, but she developed rushes and had really hard time in the flight. Also all sausage and ham products tasted terrible that I cannot tell turkey from pork. It tasted some chewy condenced substances with pink color. I recommend to get vegetarian or halal /kosher foods even if you care less to avoid all meals. Just food alone (even we brought our own foods) convinced us that we are paying extra to book on JAL or ANA next time."
Dec 2019,20,"Snarky attendants, LOUD, uncomfortable seat, bleh food","For some reason the attendance covered their nametags. I caught one when I was leaving. Her name was Lynette. I have a chronic illness and recent surgery. I couldn’t lift my luggage up and when I asked the attendant she just said yeah you’re gonna have to put that up. I said but I’m gonna need help. She walked away. I asked the next one who came by and she was also not going to help me. So finally third one came by and I said look I have asked to other tenants to help me with this and all I’ve been told is that yes it needs to go up but nobody will actually help me put it up. Finally this lady attendant helped me.    However, when I first got on the plane I was in the last row of the first section. On the seating chart on United it doesn’t show that this is a last row next to the kitchen. It shows nothing behind it. It shows another food and beverage place somewhere else. So we were not sure what this area was when we were selecting our seats. When I got to the seat there was a really loud noise above me. Some kind of engine I guess. I asked the attendant if there would be any other open seats and if we could move because this was VERY loud. Louder than other areas of the plane. My husband has tinnitus and loud constant noises are very triggering and inflaming to his external ear and inner ear. You can actually see the redness when it happens. She told me that “it’s an airplane and this is what they sound like”. Well, no, it’s an airplane and yes there are noises but this noise is extra loud in this one spot. She decided to engage in an argument with me over the loudness of the area and seat switching. I said “look I’m not asking for anything special I’m just saying this is a really awkward place to sit. If there are extra seats could We have it.” She said I would need to “talk to my agent about it.“ I said “but my agent is not here you are. Normally you get on a plane And the flight attendants know how full the plane is and if there’s going to be any open seats. That is why I am asking you”. She had brown hair and probably in her late 40s.  It should not have gotten this tense over something that is a very reasonable request given the circumstances. Not only that but my husband and I couldn’t even talk to each other without shouting because the seats are so far apart In that row and the noise was constant and LOUD. So the whole rest of the time I was worried that she would spit in my food or do something dirty. She tried to act nice after that but it just made me uncomfortable. And since the other attendants seemed so over-it and were not nice, the whole experience of business class was really wasted. An uncomfortable loud seat. Snarky attendants.What am I paying all this money for? It certainly wasn’t the bad food. The food was not great.    And the place where they need the snacks for you to help yourself is a little questionable. The champagne and wine bottles are all sitting open with no one around. As a germ freak I kind of wondered what people do to it. But that’s just me. But if you’re like me it will freak you out a little bit.    #78 United Flight ."
Dec 2019,50,Service above and beyond,My Fiance and myself went to visit family. She was on crutches and I had back problems. The staff went above and beyond when taking care of us. We were wheel chaired through out the Airports her and in Salt Lake. They took us all the way to door of plane. Exceptional people. Very friendly and talkative.
Dec 2019,10,terrible experience,The Airline did not honor the seat I booked on both trips and separated me from my wife!!! One very rude Gentleman!!!!!! and one awesome lady that kept apologizing a very classy lady.
Dec 2019,30,Decent flight but with hidden costs !,"I had to pay for the extra carry on bag (which is NOT included in the ticket and does not show up on google flights - READ THE FINE PRINT !!!).  Their overhead bins are small and hence you have to pay $30 for 1st bag to be checked in.  If you want to carry the checked bag as a carry on, then you need to pay an additional $25 for it !  Money grabbing scheme ! And quite surely NOT economy !"
Dec 2019,50,Blissfully uneventful flight,Returning from a fantastic cruise back to the real world can be stressful. The kind people at United Airlines and a blissfully uneventful flight eased my situation. I have no complaints.
Dec 2019,20,"LONG, CRAMPED FLIGHT WITHOUT MEALS","We were flying from Charlotte to Anchorage with a lay over in Chicago. We departed Charlotte at 10:45 am for a 2 hour flight to Chicago. After a little over a 3 hour lay over in Chicago we departed for Anchorage at 3:32 pm. The almost 6 hour flight to Anchorage was cramped (we were in seats 29 B & C on a 737-800) and without meal service other than snacks. We arrived in Anchorage a little after 7:00 pm, hungry and exhausted from the trip. United needs to rethink there decision to not offer meal service for such a long flight."
Dec 2019,50,Safety conscious airline,"I drove to Washington IAD Airport from Albany, NY.    The flight was a long 7.5 hour overnight flight from Washington, DC to Zurich, CH.  a dinner, midnight snack and breakfast was served. It was a good flight."
Dec 2019,10,FORCED CHECK BAG AND LOST IT!,"Pitiful! I was flying from Shreveport to Houston on United Airlines. They forced me to check my carry on bag, and told me to pick it up at Houston Airport. When I arrived at Houston, the agent at the Gate told me she already sent my bag onto the airport and to pick it up in Toronto - no tag, no consent, nothing. Who does that? Anyways, I only had 20 minutes to rush to the gate for boarding so I had to trust that the bag was sent just like she said. Surprise! Surprise! Didn't arrive in Toronto. Bag is nowhere to be found. All my personal carry on items were on that bag - wallet, car keys, house keys, everything! What a nightmare. No one will let me talk to the agent dumb agent that started this mess. Never fly United. In addition to all that, the planes are small, they offer you nothing. I can't even believe it's a functional airline."
Dec 2019,20,Customers comfort is not worth profits,"The planes are so small luggage has to be checked at the plane door. No leg room I'm not very tall and I'm usually uncomfortable. It's such a disservice to customers to pay more on the small fly for simple comfort. It's money about customers. Is their any airline out there that would be willing to dare to be different? Customers first and stop nickel and dime them, if you try it the profits will come."
Dec 2019,30,Vacation to PR,"United has a flight that leaves Bush at midnight that flies directly to Puerto Rico. Since the flight leaves so late, you still get to go to work and finish last minute things before having to leave for the airport; you don't lose a day. The flight arrives at about 5/6a into PR so you get to sleep on the plane (hopefully) and when you land, again, you don't miss a whole day. The only thing is that a lot of the car rental places aren't open so you have to wait on that. We absolutely love this flight...have used it in the past as well and will continue to use it."
Dec 2019,40,Business class service was memorable,"This flight, from EWR to MXP, was made memorable particularly by ONE CA. Overall, after an awkward check-in process, the flight itself was enjoyable. It was also ample proof of ONE CA making ALL THE DIFFERENCE,with attention, with 'service gene'."
Dec 2019,50,Great Flight,We booked basic economy but United gives regular economy service and seating on all international flights. Staff and flight crew were wonderful.
Dec 2019,20,United changed my flight to next day,"United cancelled my flight in September for ?mechanical problems? and rescheduled me for the next day. I couldn't wait until the next day so had to purchase another ticket on another airline. They said they'd reimburse me $400 but it never showed up on my credit card. After much bother with phone calls and the online system, I was told I'd get $200 reimbursed....still looking for that money....Asheville airport seems to be a very low priority airport as I've had other flights cancelled for no clear reason."
Dec 2019,40,Comfortable Flight,"First class is not what it used to be, however Flight Attendants were very attentive. Issues with the entertainment system throughout the flight"
Dec 2019,20,Pathetic,"Weather in Springfield caused United to cancel my return the evening after Thanksgiving. The similarly scheduled American flight proceeded without issue. After a series of rescheduled departures that evening, United finally cancelled the flight just before 10 PM. WE went from gate C8 to the C-concourse service desk and were told the flight had not been cancelled so WE returned to C8 where we were told the flight had been cancelled, and it was. WE were then told that the flight would leave from C8 at 6 AM the next morning, we could get a hotel voucher, we could sleep on cots in the F concourse, or we could sleep in C which I did. Over night the plane disappeared, and the flight was again cancelled. I checked the United automated status system and it said the flight had not been cancelled. I went to the service desk, scanned my boarding pass and was advised I had 3 chances to fly standby to Springfield. The service desk was not open but did a half hour later. In the mean time, I tried alternative airports at the scanner and was put on the same flight that I was on the night before. When the service desk opened an agent put me on an American flight leaving 3 hours earlier than the United flight would have left. Then the horror of O'Hare began as I walked from concourse C to concourse G. This whole path has only one electric sidewalk between C and B, the rest is glistening granite with no electric walks. I got lucky at American and was able to go standby 3 hours earlier than United had arranged. My main complaint is that United cannot be trusted to tell its passengers the truth. It it had been truthful, WE would have left ORD for SGF at 6 AM."
Dec 2019,50,Best airlines!,Always have pleasant experiences with United airlines - been using them for years. Wish they would bring back some sort of food service though.
Dec 2019,30,Work Trip to LA,"Morning flight from Boston to LAX. It was a last minute booking and I don't usually use this airline. Had a bad experience in the past. I was pleasantly surprised, the aircraft was clean, good seating and inflight entertainment was good. Wasn't bad at all."
Dec 2019,10,There’s a reason why I don’t fly United,"To and from PVR there were issues. On the way to PVR, flight extremely delayed and they offered no excuse. Flight had no heat, so we were freezing. Once again, no excuse.    Coming back to DCA, flight was first delayed and then eventually cancelled. Once again no excuse. I then had to use the next 3 hrs to try and get a flight back to the Dca area. But was told by the UA employee, I had to find my own bag if I wanted it to go on the flight with me, WTF!?!? Long story short, finally got home at 1 am, hrs after I was supposed to and another UA employee got my bag in my flight and assured me that the other agent didn’t know what they were doing as far as my bags.    Never again!"
Dec 2019,40,United always delivers,"slight delay in leaving but we well informed about the delay, good in flight service, meal was very good"
Dec 2019,50,Fine flight,United has one of the better first class perks on most of its flights.  Food is quite good and the service is excellent.
Dec 2019,50,staff are always friendly and attentive,"ALthough my return flight did not offer TV screens, the flight was very satisfying and went by quickly."
Dec 2019,40,Relaxing Flight to Shanghai,Excellent Flight with great In Flight Service. The Flight Attendant team was very attentive and did a wonderful job!
Dec 2019,50,Trip to Florida,On time and smooth flights. Pilot and attendants were very professional. Only one carry on allowed though
Dec 2019,30,business trip to CA,flight was fine but it seems like all airlines nickel and dime you for everything. your lucky you get your soda for free. they are always professional and kind.
Dec 2019,40,rome italy,"United took very good care of us, arrive at the airport, my wife left her purse in the car and our driver left, we missed our flight and the agent at the ticket counter was able to get us out early the next morning thru Chicago to Rome,only missed one day and at no up charge from airline."
Dec 2019,50,United Airlines,"On time, pleasant staff. Seats uncomfortable.  Denver airport is crazy busy! Leave plenty of time between flights as the wait for trams is long."
Dec 2019,40,"Good space, nice and clean","Very good and spacious flight. Seats were comfortable. Good service by the staff.  Recommended for a good travel experience.  One thing they could definitely improve is allowing 2 checked in bags while we travel from India to US. They are also very strict with baggage weight. If it is just one checked in bag, they could allow an extra 1-2 pounds when in need."
Dec 2019,40,"Excellent Service, Excellent food, okay seat comfort..","I boarded the flight with minimal expectation. I already knew that the Inflight Service has tremendously improved for the past couple of years, (very friendly Flight Attendants, and responsive to needs that are reasonable), and the seats are cramped. But this flight exceeded my expectation, in both service and as well food service. I am a vegetarian, and I am aware that for international flights they have two standard choices of one with meat and one Vegetarian (Lacto). I chose the vegetarian choice and the food was very tasty. It was also sufficient food. Pre-food drink service, drink service along food and post meal, was awesome. The flight crew was pleasant.  The mid flight snack and breakfast prior to landing was absolutely awesome -- Oatmeal with fruits cooked (not packaged oats, but steel-cut oats) with minimal sugar and fruits was unbelievable.  But for the seat width, I think United, at least for international service is a definitely a 4 Star + airline and wholeheartedly recommend to anyone."
Dec 2019,40,Still the friendly sky airline to me.,"I usually fly United since I think it is the most comprehensive airline around, flying everywhere you would want to go. I think United works hard trying to balance comfort,  cost, and convenience."
Dec 2019,20,"Dated (and smelly) Planes, Poor Service","The title says it all. The planes have a bad stench, the chairs are not comfortable, the flight attendants are abrupt and the food is barely average. The only added value about this flight is that it goes direct from Geneva to D.C."
Dec 2019,10,Extremely BAD Conditions on United Airlines,"With airfares skyrocketing, services diminish. It’s ridiculous for the peons trapped in coach, to have to walk past the over the top seats in business class. In the back, people are squeezed into tiny seats that are so small, elbows keep bumping into the passenger in the center seat. I measured the tray table and it was just a bit wider than a 12” ruler.  The seats have shrunk in width and are extremely uncomfortable. Where once a coach seat reclined, now each seat goes back a mere 2”. It’s almost unbelievable, that United would gouge the public, making sure they get hundreds of passengers elbow to arses, on these transatlantic flights. The food is the worst. Prepackaged garbage from European countries. Beef could be horse meat, for all we know.  I had a window seat on the right side of the plane. My right arm got so cold from sitting next to the window, that I couldn’t stand it. My arm actually ached and I became chilled all over. The thin piece of fabric which United calls a blanket, have no warmth at all. The flight had left London after 3pm & was to be a very long 8 hr trip. I sat, crammed in and feeling sick to my stomach, for as long as I could.  The meal service was finished and the lights were lowered. I noticed that passengers weren’t lining up for the toilets anymore. I grabbed my magazine and phone, excused myself, and headed back to an empty lav on the right side of the plane. (The others were located nearby in the center). With the seatbelt sign was off, nobody around, I went in and placed the toilet seat top down and I sat. It was warm in there and my elbows had space. I looked at the time. It was exactly 10pm. I began reading my magazine and thawing out. There was never a knock on the door, so I sat there. I’m sure the two people in my row were enjoying a little elbow and extra leg room with me gone. I sat in the toilet, reading and enjoying the space, until checking the time. It was 11:40p and not too long before we’d be landing in DC. With regret, I knew I had to make my way back to my seat. The lights were still low and it looked like everyone was trying to sleep. Crawling back into that horrible seat, next to a cold, frigid window, was terrible. I thought then, as I think at this moment, I will never, EVER fly United again. For this airline to add extra rows of seats, taking away leg room, cutting the width of the seat and restricting the recline to 2”...is total GREED. I’ve been a Frequent Flyer w United since 1986, Red Carpet Lounge member and I travel to London at least twice a year. After my trip in mid November, 2019, I swore that I’d never be this miserable again.  I’ve added a photo of my meal. Handed out as a turkey sandwich, the wrapping called it an “Ovenable” breast of ham turkey with pesto. The “Crostini”, as it was called, was made in Germany. They obviously don’t know that there’s no such thing as a breast of ham. There was no ham, just a thin slice of what looked like turkey. I tried to get a photo of the wrapping, so I could show my family. If you can make out the small print, you can see the ingredients including the breast of ham. United got the last of my money. It’s a cattle car, a sardine can. I was so happy to land in Virginia. Never again. I understand not all carriers have cut their services so dramatically, so I’ll definitely be flying another, Friendlier Sky on my next journey."
Dec 2019,40,Flying a UA flight operated by Lufthansa: the best solution!,"This is the best solution, cheaper than business class, but I had a comfortable seat, a real blanket, real cutlery and china, choice for dinner... For a 7 hours flight this was great."
Dec 2019,10,Highly do not recommend,"I was very disappointed the flight did not have access to watch a movie, tv, or anything without using my own personal device.    There service was poor. I wouldn’t use united airlines again if possible."
Dec 2019,50,Really comfortable,I flew on Continental/United from Newark to Milan. The service was good and the seat was very comfortable.
Dec 2019,40,Good experience,"Good flight, on schedule, Good entertainment ,what was asthonishing was the „old“ Stewarts on board. That was no Problem bitte i Never mentioned such old Personal on a flight"
Dec 2019,40,Excellent value flight,"Good flight on time, good service and excellent value. Food was reasonable, better than other airlines I have used."
Dec 2019,40,Good flight; decent fare; poor pet-transport communications!,"This was actually a relocation, but the ""business"" option on this form is as close as I can get since the relocation is the result of a job. The flight was great; smooth fight, and they did a great job of getting our Siberian Husky here, even with a change of planes at Dulles International. Our only complaints would be 1) super high cost for transporting a dog in cargo-hold (pretty much the same cost as flying ME here!), and 2) the poor communications on the part of the pet-handling service regarding drop point. We were instructed to drop her at the cargo terminal, so after cabbing to cargo with a Husky, an over-sized pet crate, and all our luggage, we had to get all of that over to the passenger terminal, where the United staff checked her in just like a passenger and then took her to cargo-hold. So overall, other than the cost, I would highly recommend United for this flight, and for pet-transport. But they clearly need to get a better grip on their third party company who communicates the drop off place and instructions. We actually went to this cargo terminal a day ahead of time to confirm our pet-shipment and all the details. At that time no one there informed us that we would be dropping her at the normal passenger terminal. A huge mis-communication and added travel headache for customers!    Leg room was a little tight, but when you have a turbulence-free flight across the Atlantic, and you and your pet and all your luggage arrive safely and on time...........that's a ""good day""."
Dec 2019,40,BIL to PHX,"Pleasant flights, crews were courteous and attentive. Flights were on time and smooth - which given my previous experience with United was a real pleasure"
Dec 2019,40,LUCKY GUY AM I,The Flight was delayed 1 hour for bad weather No problem with that it happens Finally i got to Chicago my flight to Portland was delayed but this is where i got Lucky my flight from Albany parked at Gate C-25 my Flight to Portland was parked at Gate C-23. Iam a Lucky Guy.
Dec 2019,10,United is a joke .. do not trust!,"On the flight from Everett to Denver, I was put in first class as they ""wanted my business "". ( I am an MVP with AK. ) on the way back, THE FLIGHT WAS CANCELED, which I realized from a screen 15 minutes after I checked my bag. Everything already booked on United from Denver to WA state for the night. Requested the direct AK flight a couple of gates down that had openings but United ""doesn't have a contract "".. so having spoken with United customer service in the Philippines, I requested a connecting flight through SFO and will get in 4 hours later instead of the next day. Better than some who requested hotels. I have family in both places and there is no weather. FAA website says air traffic control. Yet, customers are declined hotel compensation as United maintains that it was weather.    THIS IS WHY I HAVEN'T FLOWN UNITED IN 2 YRS. RUN AWAY!"
Dec 2019,20,very average and below international standards,Worn out aircrafts which were not well maintained. Staff were going thru the motion and did not even bother to find out the names of the meals they were handing out. no snacks were on such long flights and FA prefered not to be bothered.
Dec 2019,40,On time and very good,"From Houston, this is a direct flight arriving in Costa Rica in 3 1/2 hours. Everything went very smoothly."
Dec 2019,50,Great United Team - Very Attentive,"My 14.5 hours flight to Houston was a breeze! From an easy, fast checkin to attentive in flight service to smooth landing and luggage pickup, all was fantastic with United's super convenient nonstop from Sydney to Houston!! All United staff was friendly and helpful. My seat was clean and comfortable and food was delicious. We were given enough water to keep hydrated and feel good during the long flight. The warm nuts are always a favourite, along with build your own sundae :)"
Dec 2019,20,Sardine City,Tiniest seats ever. Worst food choices ever. Cattle cars sound better. Welcome to the friendly skies of United.
Dec 2019,50,Very pleasant flight,"It was a very comfortable flight, attendants very pleasant. They still give free snacks and water :-)"
Dec 2019,50,Wonderful flight,"What made this an outstanding flight was that the staff was extremely attentive to the minutest details. I flew 80,000 miles this year and I have had some good experiences but this particular one was outstanding.  No doubt the flight attendants have a lot to do with this, This is not the first time I have had very great flight attendants, although not everyone of them. It behooves the airlines to pay close attention to this because this worth more than all the advertising."
Dec 2019,20,Long flight on a small slow airplane.,only good thing about the E 175 is seating is 2 and 2. Bought the only thing that looked good and that they had on the cart and it was the hummus and it was the worst tasting thing that I have had in a long time. All of the flights with United the menu selection in the magazine for sale is never on the flights that we take or they were told that they didn't load it on this flight. also their is never in flight entertainment that works.
Dec 2019,10,This plane is too small for the length of flight.,"E-145, This plane is small than most private business jets. It is slow and cramped no room for carry on luggage or over any over head space. Oh don't plan on going to the bath room, if the cart is in the isle you are not going because you cant get their."
Dec 2019,10,"I was ask by staff to not lean into the isle, Not my fault.",2- 300 lb men next to me on the isle on a A-319 is No No. i had 1/3 of my seat and 1/2 of my shoulder room was taken up the other 2 men. The Stewardess ask me to not lean into the isle because she could not get the beverage cart down the isle. I pointed out that the passenger next to me was taking up my seat as well as his shoulder were pushing me into the Isle.
Dec 2019,40,All went as scheduled.,We flew through Houston with a long distance between gates. Everything went on time. No surprises...all good.
Dec 2019,20,Small E175 two small seats on each side of Isle.,Looks like a baby 737. Smooth flight but 2 miles from the Arrival gate to the Departure Gate. We would never have made if the airlines hadn't of provided me with a wheel chair and someone pushing me to get to the next gate in time. i had torn up my knee in Nashville when taking the luggage off of the conveyor.
Dec 2019,30,Just okay 😆,The flight attendant ’s name Mike who has been very helpful and help us to book the flight from Denver to St.louis since our flight from Tokyo was delay almost 6 hours!!!  He was so kind he is the best asset for United Airlines.  Thank you so much Mike 🙏🙏🙏  We will remember you forever!!!
Dec 2019,30,Nice flight for having to be at the airport at 5AM,Nice flight to Denver but it is 1 mile trek with a train-ride from the arrival gate to the Departure gate. Almost did not make our departure flight due to the lack of proper signage or anyone to direct you.
Dec 2019,30,Partner of Air New Zealand,"We were travelling with Air New Zealand back to Australia, which entitled us  to 2 suitcases each. When we checked in at Newark, we were told we could only have one suitcase each. The attendant was very rude & not helpful at all. United Airlines wanted US$160 for an additional case.  The service on the flight was nothing special - not my preference of an American airline."
Dec 2019,20,Shut the Door,"My connection was late but arrived 20 minutes before schedule departure. Unable to board, said doors were closed. We were at the gate within our boarding pass time."
Dec 2019,30,Today's Standards,"Monterey is a small airport, yet effective. We had a smaller plane and just one crew member servicing us for the 2 hour flight, and she was efficient and polite."
Dec 2019,40,Very kind flight attendant,We flight with handicap person and they made their best to help her.. (paid breakfast) was good and seats are ok
Dec 2019,50,Awesome,"We booked Polaris business class for this 11 hour flight. Our trip began with a few hours at the Polaris Lounge. The lounge was consistent with the quality of our flight. Great service, food and beverages. Relaxing and comfortable.  Boarding was easy and well organized. Flight staff were welcoming and pleasant. They offered champagne and other beverages as soon as we got settled in. Meal choices and quality were excellent. Movie selections were up to date. Our lie flat seats made this long trip comfortable. Cabin temperature was just right. Restrooms were kept clean throughout the flight. We felt relaxed and well rested arriving in Frankfurt. Highly recommend this flight."
Dec 2019,50,Son's wedding in Joshua Tree CA,My husband fell off a ladder four days prior to our departure. We were leaving to go to our sons wedding in California. The airline was very accommodating in assisting us with wheel chair assistance at all our connections. They even went as far as to move him to more comfortable setting. We had to shorten our trip and change our reservations when coming back home. All of these changes were done at no extra cost to us. United went above and beyond to make a very difficult time for us as easy as possible. Coming back our flights were changed last minute due to inclement weather and once again excellent care to accommodate us.
Dec 2019,40,Quicker than I thought,This was a smaller jet (only 2 seats on each side compared to three on larger jets) but it was comfortable and the flight from Denver to Palm Springs was quicker than I thought. The only downside was one back tire seemed to go flat before takeoff and made for a rough landing and taxi to the gate. Pilots handled it safely. Love the easy transition from plane to terminal at Palm Springs airport.
Dec 2019,40,On time and friendly people,"The flights were on time, the people were kind, the drinks and snacks were ok. I didn`t like the charge for one suit case."
Dec 2019,40,The flight was normal. M,This was round trip travel. For the most part the flights were fine. I did not like the meal for the flight to Australia. But the return flight was better.
Dec 2019,40,Round trip completed on time,"Good service, on-time departure and arrivals including connections, An all-around good airline I like that they got way better at boarding by sections and not allowing those impatient people to board when it’s not their time the United club was nice but the food keeps getting simpler, I did enjoy several call drinks at the bar at no extra charge."
Dec 2019,50,Excellent Airline,I've flown with United Airlines several times in the past few years. Everyone that I dealt with at United was OUTSTANDING!!! Highly recommended...….!!!
Dec 2019,10,Sat on board for two hours while they put tape on the cabin floor,"We sat on the plane for 2 hours while they had two guys come in and put down tape on the cabin floor near the galley. Which of course caused a number of us to miss connections in DC. I had to spend another hour in line on arrival late at night in DC to rebook flights, get vouchers, etc. Exhausting. Stupid. Poorly organized/handled."
Dec 2019,50,Everything was top rated,"Perfect....Every flight was right on time. In-flight service was nice. Flight attendants can only offer what someone way above their status has decided they can serve. However, all flight attendants were very nice, friendly, and well mannered."
Dec 2019,40,It was fine for the price,"Seating was tight, but for the price we paid round trip, it was worth it. Seats in Economy are very close together."
Dec 2019,40,We made it on time!,"Well, we held our breath and made it back and forth without much delay. They overbooked our flight home and if some poor soul had not offered the deal they were making, we would still be sitting there in Richmond!"
Dec 2019,20,Short on service,"We took a flight from DC to SF. I asked the agent at the check in if we could upgrade to extra leg room. Our seats were in the back of the plane. I had check their seating map and saw lots of seat open. He was very short and said NO. He was very unhelpful. When we were flying from SF to DC, we were able to upgrade our seats with a very nice and lovely young women. What a huge difference in these two employees! In flight service on our return trip to SF was poor. They served beverages two times on this long flight."
Dec 2019,20,FIRST CLASS....No way was it.,"No movie monitors, chips and drink on a five hour flight. Cabin freezing, and one thin blanket per person...yes, I had a jacket. No pillow. Hell, paid enough for it. Flight was over night to dusk...flight attendants talked to each other. Who could possibly try and sleep. Never again United...NEVER! Look around your competition is doing so much more to keep its First/Business class passangers. Trip was Oct./Nov."
Dec 2019,30,Cramped economy seating,"Very cramped seating. Flight was a little late, but otherwise good. Good flight attendants, very efficient."
Dec 2019,40,Early Day Connection,"Took the early flight to the Windy City for a connecting flight to Appleton, WI. Everything on time and not a crowded airport to depart from"
Dec 2019,20,Flight from Hawaii to cleveland,"On the way to Hawaii a 9.5 hour flight , NO FOOD was served! absolutely embarrassing. Received a small bag of pretzels and a drink! That’s it.simply u acceptable! On way home they changed our flight to flying all night with 3 stops,Honolulu to San Francisco, San Francisco to Chicago,Chicago to cleveland! Way too many legs of the trip. Just change flights all around with no say in the matter."
Dec 2019,40,Missed connection,Missed connecting flight by three minutes. Plane still on ground at gate but captain said he would not open door for the four passengers who were there three minutes late.  But good news we got on next flight to Orlando.
Dec 2019,30,Flying to Panama,"Flight to Houston was crowded. Flight to Panama City was better, more comfortable, I have no complaints. However, coming back to the USA I have an issue. I bought two bottles of rum in the Panama airport and picked the rum up at the gate, as I have done in other countries. The bottles were carefully wrapped and packed in cardboard at the liquor store. I put them in a carry on bag. In the customs line in Houston, when checking the luggage, I was told by an inspector that I could not bring the rum in. I would either have to give it to United or go back to the United check in and go through customs all over again. I wasn't about to forfit it, so I did as told. United charged me $30, as much as the rum had cost in the airport liquor store. This was very upsetting. I would urge others to be careful and not get the same run-around."
Dec 2019,30,Regional jets grounded in Denver Friday after Thanksgiving!,"I understand being grounded in Denver for weather reasons. What I don't understand is that since we were stranded we requested our bags and were told it would take 4 to 6 hours to have our bags brought to baggage claim area. They can get a bags to a plane in 15 minutes, or off a plane and to baggage claim in less than 20, but it takes 4 to 6 hours to get them to the owners if they are stranded??? They looked at us like we were asking for a free hotel room!! That is totally ridiculous and only the result of not caring about the customer. Hire more people! Create a system for cases like this! The conveyor belt obviously goes to baggage claim from the bowels of DIA? We didn't see our bags for three days when they finally flew them to our destination. We drove home!"
Dec 2019,50,Great nonstop flight from DC to Vegas,"Smooth on time departure & arrival! Everyone quickly boarded and kept their luggage to approved airline size. No hassles, just relax & enjoyed the 5 hr. Flight. Made a new friend with our passenger! We spent the time laughing and chatting. Great flight!"
Dec 2019,50,Very helpful gate agent,"All I really want from an airline flight is to get where I’m going on time, or at least not so late that I miss a meeting. When my first flight was delayed for a mechanical issue and I wasn’t going to be able to make my connection, the gate agent made sure I got booked on the next flight to my final destination- even though everything looked full. She also made sure that my bag was switched to the right gate and arrived with me. Definitely appreciated!"
Dec 2019,40,Yes to the Embraer 175,"We flew an Embraer 175 and the difference in the amount of leg room between this plane and the larger planes was surprising, making it a much better flight. My partner even commented that he will try to fly on this type of plane all the time because of its comfort. Service was good, flight was smooth, we were on time each leg - all in all, a good trip."
Dec 2019,10,United Airlines treats customers worse than a dog,"Our United flight returning to the USA came in quite late to Puerto Vallarta. It caused the three of my family to miss our connection in Houston along with probably 30 plus people. The United ticket people were extremely rude and could of cared less. We were stuck overnight at 100% our own expense despite it being the airlines fault. United has not only decreased leg room on planes--it seems to have made a policy of hiring rude air hostess as well. Flying in to Mexico, the flight was way more than half empty. The entire first half of plane totally empty! We were all told we could not spread out there because there was more ""leg room""--"" that none of us had paid for."" I tell everyone to stay away from United now. It's a nightmare airline!"
Dec 2019,40,from SoCal to Reno by way of San Francisco,Would prefer non-stop but it was ok going.  Come home the same route was not so good.  Loaded us in SF on a plane with a problem had to unload.  Next plane was at the opposite side of the airport with a short time frame.  Non-stop would be better.
Dec 2019,30,"Great first class, abysmal economy","Flew to new delhi on points and got first class. service was excellent with very friendly flight attendants. Comfortable seat and it laid out into a very decent bed with ample entertainment options. The food however was terrible and I expected more for first class. Here's why I give it only 3 stars...flying in economy is a totally different experience. Rude staff, abysmal food and poor baggage handling. I'm returning to India next month and I'm flying Lufthansa hoping (hoping is the operative word) for a better experience. Airlines in the US are terrible, we have no luxurious airlines like Emirates Qatar KLM etc. Why is this??? I would gladly pay more for a better in flight experience. If I fly within the US I have no choice but to use United (American Airlines is a NIGHTMARE!!!), but going international I wouldn't choose them again, just not worth the money."
Dec 2019,30,Thanksgiving travel,Flew from Chicago to San Francisco to spend Thanksgiving with our son and family. We had taken a short flight from our home base to Chicago so had to walk quite a distance to get to our new gate. Our flight was uneventful but found the space between rows of seats ridiculously narrow. The passenger in front of me reclined his seat so I had even less space. Just felt like packed sardines trying to get comfortable in this environment for such a long flight. An in-flight movie/entertainment was available but needed our own ear phones/plugs (downloaded United app). There must be a better way to travel than this or the airlines could just take out a few rows of seats and give remaining passengers a little leg room without having to buy a first class ticket. Ugh!
Dec 2019,50,Problem Free,I had a good flight and had to change planes in Denver. Everything ran on time and the attendants were very nice. My best flights have been on United.
Dec 2019,40,What are in those giant suitcases and how did they get through TSA?,"I fly Basic Economy no matter who I fly. A book bag works for me and has greatly simplified my life. I am never stressed about my bag fitting or gate checking. I can’t buy any souvenirs because a book bag barely carries a full week of clothes and an extra pair of shoes. (Oh yes you can....I squeeze the air out of everything like a bell jar) As much as I like a Frontier, they are like an acquaintance that just can’t commit to a relationship. I will choose United for nearly all my travel."
Dec 2019,20,Terrible Food,"On other airlines that I have flown first class, the food was great. This was definitely the worst airplane food I have ever had. I requested gluten free in advance. The meal was a dried out, unseasoned piece of chicken over a weird tasting plain rice. The individually wrapped GF roll was super dry and crumbly. The only thing that tasted decent was the cooked broccoli side. I really wish I had eaten some of the delicious smelling healthy food options they had at SFO airport.    Also, the boarding process was terrible. Group 1 consisted of what seemed like half the plane, and they asked us to line up as the other plane was still pulling in."
Dec 2019,40,The flight was pretty good.,The flight was pretty good. The space between seats wasn't enough. The overall quality could be better but definitely was not bad.
Dec 2019,20,Toronto to IAD (Dulles) Flight 6197,"This is not a review of United overall, but of this particular flight, and the unexpected situations therein. I do not recommend this flight to people who want a comfortable aircraft. It was too small, and the seats in Premium Economy were actually just as small as coach. Another bad part of the flight is the location in the A terminal where the flight comes in. There is shall we say, a LOT of walking to get to ground transportation, and you still need to take the dreaded Dulles train that saves no times, but adds so much distance. We deplaned at roughly 4:15. By the time I got to the Passenger Pickup, it was literally 4:50. Thats Washington for you....inefficiency, red-tape, long distances, poor design. In many ways these things we see in politics map directly to this flight."
Dec 2019,30,"Non-stop flight but cramped and uncomfortable, even with an aisle seat.","Although we flew on Thanksgiving Day, this flight was full, and uncomfortable. I paid ""extra"" for economy, rather than basic economy, and thus avoided a middle seat, but seating in regular economy on this 737-stretched plane is really cramped. There is hardly any knee room, and the narrow seats make for ""spill-over"" from the normal-sized person crammed into the middle seat next to you. The two bathrooms in the rear have been designed to be so narrow (to allow an extra row of ""economy seating"") and are so tight that one can hardly turn around. Very claustrophobic feeling, even when you escape from your seat. Of course there was no food provided, and a small cup of soda, with no refills offered in the almost 4 hour flight says how little they value regular customers. To add insult to discomfort, they only gave 1/2 a frequent flyer mile for each air mile that we flew (720 miles for Austin to San Francisco), and at over $760 round-trip, this was no bargain. There are better airlines (JetBlue, Southwest, and Alaska come to mind), but there were not other non-stops serving this route. The only bright spot was the free movies you can stream to your tablet, which not every airline, or even this one on some of their older planes, provides."
Dec 2019,40,Flying United,"United is my preferred airline, because I have the United Explorer Credit Card, which  grants me a free flight ever so often. I have been flying to Cancun for over 30 years due to a timeshare I own there. The service is always excellent and dependable. The only thing they can improve on is to have the necessary forms for Mexico on board, i.e.  immigration and customs forms. Lately they have been lacking the customs forms, which will be handed to you after landing in Cancun. There is no place to sit down to fill this out in the crowded Cancun airport. I am almost 80 years old and would prefer to finish it while being seated in a comfortable chair onboard the plane. Is it so difficult to pick up these forms on the return flight to have them available on the next  flight down there? I mentioned this once before, but apparently it was not important enough?? Since it does not happen on every flight, I assume that some flight attendants pay more attention to these details."
Dec 2019,10,United almost got screwed over on our flight back,"Our flight to Europe was fine, our flight back to America was horrible.    Originally, we had a five-hour layover in Chicago, but United screwed us over. Without telling us, United canceled our original return flight and placed us on another flight with a two-hour layover in Chicago.    Seriously, we didn't find out about this change until we were at the airport in Rome, and were pissed to say the least. No email, text, or phone call to notify us of this change. United just planted us on this flight and we had to deal with it.    Two hour layovers are fine if the airport is small and you don't have to go through customs. That was NOT the case for us.    Anyone who has been to O'Hare knows that not only is the airport huge, but TSA has a huge bottleneck and the domestic flights are across a freakin' highway from international arrivals.    Seriously, by the time we cleared customs, got our bags, and got through security, we made it to our gate that was JUST BOARDING! This means we didn't have time to eat real food or get water, which left us with severe sinus headaches the entirely of the five-hour flight.    To add insult to injury, the plane was CRAMPED and barely had a beverage service. Only one tiny bottle of water, in a severely cramped plane, on a five-hour flight. Seriously one of the worst flights I have ever been on.    I would say avoid United, but unfortunately, it's one of the top four airlines in the United States, so it's probably unavoidable."
Dec 2019,30,hope your suit case doesn't get damaged,I always liked United because their schedule suits mine. The trip I take every year usually stops in Houston TX. but this trim took me to Chicago a beautiful airport and huge. It was my first time going there. My issue is my suitcase was perfect when we departed but when we arrived In Philadelphia it was destroyed. There was no one at the baggage claim because the plane landed after midnight So the next day I notified United and they asked me to send pictures which I did and they said no problem . They sent me a 50.00 voucher which turned out to be useless with all the exclusions. so they can get away with damaging your property and not have to pay for it. All I got was a friendly letter and a useless voucher
Dec 2019,30,Okay,"Flew first class, no welcome, no preboard drink,  No inquiries preflight about what we want once we are in the air. One drink served for 3 hour 40 minute flight. WiFi Definitely not up to par."
Dec 2019,50,Trip home,"My primary measures of a flight are three. One, most importantly, is it on time? Two, did I get my selected seat that I reserved? Three, did my baggage arrive and was it off loaded in a timely manner. The answer to each question was yes and therefore was very happy."
Dec 2019,30,First Class on United waste of money,"Flew first class, no welcome, no preboard drink,  No inquiries about what we want once we are in the air. One drink served, poor snack selection. Spotty WiFi. Staff couldn’t be bothered."
Dec 2019,40,Pleasant flight,"We were pleasantly surprised that we had a smooth flight with no problems. Staff was courteous and efficient. As always, with economy, leg room could have been better but it was a short flight."
Dec 2019,10,Worst flight ever! We missed our best friends' wedding,"We were supposed to fly from SJC to LGA with a stop in DEN. The night before our flight, we received a text saying that our flight was delayed. The default link sent us to SFO instead of SJC. So we had to call United to find another flight out of San Jose. We finally found one that was one hour after our original flight time. Once we arrived in Denver, our flight out was delayed as well. After boarding the plane, we sat for two hours on the plane because they had to de-ice the plane. They did this TWO times. Then we were asked to get off the plane, waited, went to another gate, got on another plane and waited another hour. Then we were told the plane had mechanical issues and we had to get off the plane again. The flight crew had exceeded their FAA work hours, so our flight was cancelled for the night! They sent us to a huge line where we had to wait for a voucher for one night's stay at a nearby hotel. Our flight would not be until 7 am the following morning. Which meant we wouldn't arrive until after 1pm the next day. Our best friends' wedding was set for 10am. So after all the preparations we made as wedding guests, we did not make it in time for the wedding! It is sad that United Airlines thinks that a $20 food voucher is good enough to replace all the time and money we spent on the flight and wedding prep. ie. tailored traditional dress for the wedding, one night's hotel stay at the hotel we were supposed to be at that night, extra pricey airport food that we had to purchase since we were stuck there for so long)  Never again will I fly with UNITED AIRLINES!!!"
Dec 2019,40,First time aboard,The flights are long but comfortable. Water is offered frequently to keep you well hydrated. Flight attendants friendly.
Dec 2019,40,flight to the clubn,"past june this year was my 11th club was at turks before.Talked to ppl going there first time or some have been there before this was good for all of us. Went over layout of the club, an all the great things to do an look for, this made our flight great an got there in no time ! great place enjoy"
Dec 2019,20,Missed Connections,"Get to the airport to find out my 3:30 flight has been delayed until 5 p.m. because the flight the day before was cancelled. Not worried as this would still give me time to make my connection to Toronto. However, it was almost 7 p.m. when we left and this meant I would meet my connecting flight They blamed it on not having enough staff & the caterers couldn't handle the 2 flights. Get to San Fransisco & the next flight to Toronto won't be for 13 hours - grrrr. Not given any hotel or food vouchers to fill that time. Not to mention that all expenses had to be paid by me. The staff at the airport was rude & very unhelpful and treated it like it was my problem that their plane was late. I always thought Spirit was bad, but I'd fly Spirit before flying United again."
Dec 2019,30,I prefer direct flights United is only airline direct to SXM.,If you want a direct flight to Sint Maarten and you are in North Jersey your choices are United from Newark Liberty or drivr to New York's JFK. The flight itself wasn't bad but I only fly United because they have the only direct flight. Not a fan of the airline.
Dec 2019,50,Phenomenal customer service,"My mom and I received a text from United updating us that our flight was delayed. This led us to take our time to get to the airport, amidst the busy NJ rush hour traffic. By the time we got to Newark airport & tried checking in our bags we realized that the plane status changed to on time & the flight was already boarding. There was no way we would have been able to get through security & to our gate on time. That’s when Des Carmony came in & saved the day. He went above and beyond helping us find the next flight to LAX. Thankfully he was able to find a flight that took off an hour later which was perfect! It was the last two spots on the plane with the extra leg room & dinner included which was such a nice surprise. On top of that, his exceptional customer service allowed us time to shop & buy souvenirs for loved ones! He deserves recognition for his kindness, professionalism & fast service!"
Dec 2019,10,Never United,"I had an early flight at 11AM and my flight has been delayed 4x, where the last one they had made us get off right after due to plane issues. It is now 4PM, where the last delayed said he would be able to depart at exactly 4PM but still no update.    Burbank workers have no sense of urgency and they seriously couldn’t care any less about it. Tried to switch to another flight and they just said no."
Dec 2019,30,Delayed in Denver,We traveled on Thanksgiving day before with no delays from LAX to London. LAX was like a ghost town on Thanksgiving Day 2016.. WE thought great lets do it again. We flew out of Bakersfield with a layover in Denver.. Unfortunately our flight was delayed in Denver because our pick up plane from San Fransisco had technical problems and United had to find a replacement.. We should of landed in Boston by 3:30pm instead we arrived at 9pm.
Dec 2019,30,Flight from Newark to Amsterdam,United airlines flight from Newark to Amsterdam was alright. The airline has one vegetarian option per flight but they are often limited. Myself and another passenger were left with out a meal during a 8 hour flight. Luckily for me I brought food on to the plane but the man next to me did not. I felt bad for him. The flight attendants were a little rude to him aswell. Hopefully that will change on united as well as the customer service from the flight attendants. Maybe if we were fortunate enough to afford first class the service would be different.
Dec 2019,30,Los Angeles to Boston,Was thankful the flight wasn't any longer - the planes are almost past their better by date - definitely showing their age. Saggy seats in economy class. Am thankful I am not a tall person as I would have had a very uncomfortable flight. Pleasant crew but pleased the flight was only across the United States.
Dec 2019,30,Hidden Information,"I was disappointed to learn I booked a basic economy reservationI I had not flown in while and did not know there was a economy and basic economy!!! There are several restrictions for basic economy such as no carry on luggage, no cancellation and no seat assignments!!! I do not know why it changed from coach and first class to this!!. Buyer beware of this!"
Dec 2019,30,Better be in group 1 or there is no room for carry on luggage,I am a silver member and in group 2. And I fly regularly from Philadelphia to Houston. On almost every segment the gate attendant holds group.2 and insists you check luggage. They run out of room in group 1. It’s very frustrating. And the seats are murder. I am so tired United. Fly Delta. They treat you like royalty!
Dec 2019,50,easy flight,This was the first time i flew first class and it was really nice I enjoyed the extra room and the meal and the stewardess were vary nice the pilot was vary informative too
Dec 2019,40,Frequent delays,This flight is delayed quite often. I would not count on doing anything important close to the scheduled arrival time.
Dec 2019,10,Airlines the biggest rip off,"In today life you really wonder why are we continuing flying with American Airlines like United. Once in business class you were receiving a great service, awesome food and wine and an overall great experience. Today you are lucky if the flight attendants don’t insult you. Often the flight attendants have served for many decades and they just don’t care about what their job is about. The cost of traveling has increased multiple folds but the service has gone to an historical low. Starting from the airport experience down to the airline and the actual flight"
Dec 2019,40,Good service for short flights,Good service for reasonable price. Using this airline for short flights. Good entertainment free year phones.
Dec 2019,50,Nice to be called by your name,It was really nice to be recognized as a 1K member and not have to be second guessed as it happened earlier. Looks like United is changing and becoming more customer friendly.
Dec 2019,30,Smushed in Back,"We didn't realize that the economy flight would put you in the far back with little leg room. My husband is large and sat in the middle! Plus, they made me stuff my purse into my carry-on because they didn't allow but one carry on, including a purse or bag. They did allow for one free checked bag, so that was a plus. It was cheap so that was a plus."
Dec 2019,30,Disability travel,had to wait 15min for aisle chair even when prearranged and flight att asked 3 times and pilot called in twice.unacceptable...elderly and disabled people need to use a restroom and the delay just makes it worse. Coming home from medical procedure
Dec 2019,50,Houston to Bonaire Non-Stop,This is always a good nonstop flight to Bonaire. I've been flying there on United for years and there's never been any issues at all.
Dec 2019,40,Nat'l Parks,"Uneventful, which is good. Flight left on time got in close to scheduled time, no problems with luggage or boarding or seating."
Dec 2019,50,Good flight,Overall everything was to our satisfaction particularly the flight attendant who was serving us was very thoughtful and nice person.
Dec 2019,40,IAH - HNL Flight,Meal choices are limiited and a bit pricey Bring your own snacks. entetainment needs updated. smae TV shows for 3 months.
Dec 2019,20,Flying to San Francisco,Service was terrible. Rude staff. The seats were not comfortable at all. Food and drinks were ok. Check in was really fast.
Dec 2019,40,"When it comes to Airlines, unfortunately we know what to expect.","Personnel are fine. They work hard and did their best to make our flight as comfortable as possible. However, even though we had the additional seat room, while sitting straight for takeoff and landing, the headrest literally hurts to be forced into that position. It's hard to believe that airline execs actually think they are treating people well for the money they charge. And we were only two in a three across row. Still not fun."
Dec 2019,40,About United....!,"Generally a good flight, one of those overnight flights. Courteous on board service. On time departure. We actually travelled basic economy so that that baggage limitation was in effect. But that's not an indictment on the Airline. Guess it's really a good airline for flights to the US."
Dec 2019,50,Perfect Flight,"Wonderful, flight & service. We even were able to see the Alps & quaint villages which was so very exciting. I would highly recommend United. I usually fly with them."
Dec 2019,10,UA should be on the NO FLY list!,"20 years ago I swore I would never fly UA again due to poor service.  Now 20 later they happen to have the only schedule that met the dates I needed so I decided to give them another chance. I regret it.  Going from LA to Tokyo wasn’t too bad, but the return flight was horrible.  1/2hr delay on the tarmac, nothing too unusual about that though.  My and my wife’s meal was served frozen...literally. It took 10minutes to get an attendant to come over to retrieve the meals to heat them up. They brought them back 5minutes later, still cold. We returned them again, received the meals back 20minutes later, the entree was warm, but still not as warm as it should have been, the side dish of garbanzo beans were still frozen, I don’t mean cold, absolutely frozen. We gave up on their incompetence and ate the little that was edible.  About an hour later my wife and I were at the rear of the plane by the restroom and exit door stretching out. There were three fight attendants back in the food preparation section doing absolutely nothing except gabbing to each other. Meals had already been served an hour prior. One of the ladies, I use the term loosely in this case, said in a very nasty tone, “If you want to stretch, go up to the middle section and stretch.” Which meant that we would have to stand in front of the passengers the were seated in the exit row. We were absolutely in no ones way, even if they were working, which they weren’t. They just didn’t want us hear them chatting.  Not wanting to make a big deal out of it, I said, “Alright, we’ll go up there, but could we first get an ice cream, our meal was not too good”. This same attendant emphatically shouted, “Noooooo.” I said, “That’s pretty snotty, I’d like to write United about you, may I have you name please.” She leaned toward us and in an even nastier tone said, “My name is Joe.” Which it obviously wasn’t. We then just left and returned to our seats.  If we were in first class, there is no way we would have been treated this poorly, and had she done this to a first class passenger, she surely would have been fired, which she certainly needs to be. But since we were just “lowly” economy passengers, she felt as though it is ok to treat “economy people” like dirt. And obviously the management of UA feels the same way as nothing has changed there for at least 20years.  I have been flying for over 45years, back when airlines and flight attendants realized that passengers were the ones that pay their wages. Now they just want to get paid to travel around the world, and passengers are just a bother. Airline executives are getting their multimillion dollar salaries so they don’t care either. Twenty years ago my wider wrote UA for the poor service we received. For “compensation” they gave her 200miles, a whopping two dollars and fifty cents worth! That’s what they think of customers that are willing to pay only eight or nine hundred dollars for the “privilege” of flying on their planes. Well United, I tell you what, you can that that last $1800 bucks I paid and shove it up your... because that is the last dime you will ever see from me.  Funny thing is, on United’s entertainment screen it has a survey “Let us know how we are doing”, but the only option on there is a survey about the entertainment system itself, nothing about the airline or it’s staff....hmmmm, wonder why?  NEVER, NEVER, NEVER fly United Airlines."
Dec 2019,50,I got upgraded to Polaris,"I have been a United FF for a number of years and on this trip once again I got upgraded to Polaris seating. The accommodations were very comfy. The bedding branding is SAKS I believe. The food quality was excellent for a flight. It tasted like real food. The staff were excellent but I've never had poor service in business class ever. I didn't try for a full lay flat when sleeping but I understand it is possible. I personally would pay for this service but I appreciated the upgrade. This was the best 17 hour flight I have experienced. I boarded look at two movies, had dinner, went to sleep, woke up watched another movie, had breakfast and landed 30-45 mins later. Most excellent."
Dec 2019,30,Bring your own entertainment player!,This was a flight in 2019. I wasn't aware that United had done away with the entertainment screens on their acft. I had to use my phone and wasn't prepared as I hadn't downloaded their app for my phone. CHECK your airline and acft each time to see what's available. my colleague also had an issue when he needed to pay for his bag. They don't accept cash!!!! He had to go to a machine and pay for a debit card to put the money on to pay.
Dec 2019,30,It all depends,"I have flown United a lot over the years. In recent years I have seen the quality of service improve. This flight was no different. Indeed, the WIFI in flight entertainment actually worked, the seat width/pitch was tolerable and service was good for a cut rate airline. Sadly, United is no longer ""first class"" in anything, more like Alaska. But it was on time."
Dec 2019,40,Early Xmas/U.S.Thanksgiving,"This was a great flight. We had contacted the Airlines Medical Department ahead of time. My wife is on Peritoneal Dialysis and has to travel with her cycler machine. Miss Bailey was great. She recorded that we were traveling with a cycler and might also need to bring home some supplies delivered to Denver. Upon arrival at the airport we were checked in efficiently as they were expecting us . We were allowed to pre-board and stow the device in the cabin before other passengers. This really took the stress off of us, as we have had some problems with other airlines. We would definitely recommend this flight to others. United has had some bad press, but came through for us this time. Like most airlines, legroom and amenities are at a premium, or for extra cost. We did have pleasant staff, and few problems"
Dec 2019,50,Great Company made by great employees,Great flight and really nice attention from all Cabin Crew.  Special mention to the Cabin Manager Francisco Iglesias.
Dec 2019,30,UA - get rid of the small 737's - absurdly too small,"Flight attendants were OK, but the seats are too small, the aisle too narrow, the bathrooms far too small. JUST GET RID OF ALL THOSE 737's! Too packed in too small a plane. You should be able to convert most of the 737's to the new Dreamliner or other larger planes - especially for trips over one hour. And add more non-stop flights from SFO to CLE."
Dec 2019,50,belize vacation,"We picked a direct flight mid morning departure from Houston so we arrived in Belize before noon. Picked up our rental car and drove down to Hopkins bay, arriving mid afternoon Return trip departed at 200 pm so we had plenty time to pick up our vehicle and drive back home in Lake Charles. Using United card meant no baggage fees and direct flight meant less travel time, flights fit our agenda and priotry boarding included"
Dec 2019,20,avoid united,"Sat on plane for 0ver 2 hours after scheduled take off time before they decided plane had a mechanical problem. Then stood in line for over 1 hour to get hotel for the night,  new flights for the next day. Then stood in line for hotel bus, then stood in line for hotel  check in. Got up at 5 am to catch hotel shuttle. Got home 18 hours later the next day.    Only saving grace were the meal vouchers which did not cover full meals."
Dec 2019,20,Horrible seating - I could have paid less on Spirit and been just as uncomfortable,My husbands knees were against the seatback in front of him the entire trip. There wasn't even enough room between seats to reach down and pick up the napkin I dropped. We flew United instead of Spirit because we thought their seats are more comfortable but we were totally wrong. We should have flown with Spirit which would have cost less and been just as uncomfortable.
Dec 2019,30,Not the Best,"Not the best of the US carriers Ive flown with, but certainly not the worst. Had to be the oldest 777 still in service but having said that it was generally clean and all facilities worked...most of the time. Flight was an overnighter and nowhere near full so we managed to move our seats to give us more room. That did mean though that during the flight I suddenly became Mr Fazil Mamood and the staff kept wanting to give me Halal meals. I dont know whether Mr Mamood ever got any food, buts I always ended up with heaps. Entertainment systems were old and not very user friendly however everything worked for the most part. Food was quite ORDINARY, but that seems to be the norm with the American carriers."
Dec 2019,30,"Low tech entertainment, mildly disinterested staffers","Best download their app before the flight leaves if you want entertainment, which they fail to mention to you before you leave. You have to buy their slow internet to download it in flight which can take hours. They fly the base model of a most recent Boeing jet, whereas another airline that flew me out to Hawaii had the well-apportioned model. I should have paid slightly more and flown back on the same airline."
Dec 2019,30,It's always stressful when I fly United,Flying United as it's the only airline offering direct flights to sacramento. I always feel stressed when I fly United. You never know what or how the agents will be. They do not handle stress very well. As a result of this we too feel stressed. Not pleasant flying them.
Dec 2019,40,all went according to plan,"would like a nonstop flight such as Delta has just started. Also some better options on food choices for purchase, also availability of food items not good!"
Dec 2019,50,Great flight,We flew from Newark to Louisville on an express flight my first time on a small plane and it was great. Smooth flight everything on schedule.
Dec 2019,30,Buying basic stinks...,"Shame on me for buying the cheapest ticket out there. With no seat selection I was squeezed in an inhumanly small middle seat, last row in the plane. Big people both sides of me. Knowing I’d be on the plane for at least five hours I had taken care of my biobusiness ahead of time and brought 3-4 hours of movies to watch. With no overhead bin space left my backpack was crammed in down around my feet."
Dec 2019,30,Flight from Cozumel to Los Angeles,"To begin with the flight was late which made our connection to the next flight from Houston late. We had to go through initial customs, but the door we needed to exit through was locked and it took 15 minutes to get personnel to get it open. Once we made it through customs there was a half hour line to go through TSA. We ended up running to get to our gate just as the door was closing to get on the airplane. Once on board we found our seats had been given to someone else. Through this whole process there wasn't any help from United personnel. When dinner was served and they got to our seats all of the dinners were gone so we were offered snacks. When we questioned the flight atendant she said this was normal they always ran out of food. Not so much as were sorry. If I have a choice I won't fly United again even if I have to pay more for another Airline. They also charge extra for checked bags and economy class doesn't allow carry ons."
Dec 2019,10,No sense of customer service,"I took this flight in October on a very busy, rainy Sunday evening. I chose United because it was the only nonstop flight I could find. The flight is 5 1/2 hours long and the plane was incredibly old with no entertainment system of any kind. That I could live with but for a plane full of over 300 people there were only three bathrooms - two in the back for economy of which one was not working. So one bathroom for 288 people and then one bathroom for the 12 people in business/first class. There was no accommodation to allow others to use the front bathroom. Since I was only one isle away from business in a premium economy seat, I used the front bathroom. When I came out the flight attendant jumped all over me and was extremely rude, telling me I was not allowed up there. I was really furious at the way they treated people. What a joke!"
Dec 2019,20,"Flight cancelled, mechanical, no replacement.","Was travelling for a family emergency (parent dying), flight was cancelled at the last minute due to some sort of mechanical problem. They did not announce it until well after people had figured it out and looked it up online. No backup aircraft brought in. Re-routed to 3 flights over 2days, which delayed my arrival by almost 24 hours. They give you 30$ certificate to use in-house (18$hamburger so it didn’t go far) and a hotel room in Cleveland. No monetary or future travel compensation. They should always have backups as this was not only distressing, it was unnecessary. There should at least have some monetary compensation as it was an airplane problem."
Dec 2019,40,"In spite of issues out of their control, pilots got us there within 9 minutes of scheduled arrival time",We ran into headwind from COS to LAX and were 15 min late. Then they changed planes at LAX but it had too much gas on it for our short hop to SFO -- and we were only 9 min late in spite of a 45 min delay. Kudos to the pilots!
Dec 2019,40,787-10 Dreamliner is worth connecting through Newark to Europe,"Traveled to Dublin for business, and picked UAL 23 through EWR solely because the plane was a 787-10 Dreamliner. Yes, that meant connecting in EWR (my least-favorite airport in the world), but the other connection options (ORD, JFK, ATL) were all on older planes and landed in DUB later than I wanted    The plane itself is awesome. Fly it whenever you can. It doesn't hurt when you get upgraded to Premium Plus either    On this particular flight the United crew was outstanding: they hustled to get drinks and dinner served before dimming the cabin lights to night mode. Then before arriving they quickly served a full breakfast in Economy plus    Lots of in-flight entertainment options, food was decent for airplane food, and EWR to DUB is a relatively short hop if you cannot sleep on planes"
Dec 2019,50,Great offer for first class outgoing. Grabbed it.,Going out was a treat. Ice delay but came in onle 5 min late. Even against strong winds. Coming back in economy was every bit as pleasant. Gained time both ways! We are loyal and happy United users.
Dec 2019,20,Round trip with United,"Everybody from the airline was correct, polite and helpful. The app works fine and I could make the pre check and track my bags accurately both ways. Congratulations on this!    Service is limited to a mini bag of pretzels/cookies and soda/coffee/tea/water. It is the usual for economy class. No complaints there.    The ticket was not cheap and I was really surprised by the charge for every baggage we checked! Imagine 3 bags checked on the way back and paying $160!! Even when they advertise $30 for the first one and $40 for the second one. As we were traveling 2 persons the normal charge should have been 2x$30 plus 1x$40 adding up to $100... but there was no way around it and we had to pay $160. I felt cheated..."
Dec 2019,30,Late connections from Chicago to Tampa,"I flew on Dec. 2 and 3rd from Tampa to Chicago (O'Hare). The plane was a little late leaving Tampa but most of the time was made up in the air and we got to the gate almost on time. The airline was good at making announcements and keeping us informed. The flight was pretty standard- smaller seats, cold drinks after an hour and a cookie or pretzel. On the way back, the plane was delayed and there we several notifications from the United app to tell you that it was delayed. The plane was delayed coming from another location. Eventually about 90 minutes late we took off and got to Tampa. The plane service was similar- cold drinks and a small snack for free. They do have in-seat entertainment so you can watch movies or TV at your seat. The TV isn't great as the signal keeps going in and out. The movie was a lot more stable. However, every time there is an announcement the video/voice is cut off. So overall not a terrible experience but not fabulous either."
Dec 2019,30,Efficient and lackluster,"United gets you there in an efficient and uneventful manner. The 777 interior is aging and the entertainment screens are no longer up to expectations. Better to avoid the breakfast but for the rest there is a good balance between what you pay and what you get. If you have access to the Star Alliance lounge in GRU, its one of the best ones you can find with great food and drinks. Stock up before the flight !"
Dec 2019,20,Nickel & Diming,"We did not know this was one of their 'express' jets and were never advised that NO luggage could be brought on-board. Long story short, it cost us $60 for 2 pieces of luggage (one that would have fit in the compartment above on any other plane). On our return flight, we are told we were told we could not bring our carryon on the plane. Another $60. I received my bill and am seeing all types of extra charges. Just ridiculous! We will NEVER fly United again!"
Dec 2019,30,Beware cancelations,"Problem was when the flight was canceled due to bad weather in Newark. These things happen, but the communication with the passengers to get luggage and then a bus to overnight accommodations was poor. No info on where to go to get rebooked for am, bud location etc was lacking. Eventually straightened out, but frustrating . Flight itself was fine."
Dec 2019,20,Bad baggage service,2 hour short haul flight. The plane was apparently over loaded so they left checked suitcases behind. No notification to passengers. Got a text message way after landing that I had to go to baggage service. Long story short the suitcases would be on the next flight arriving at 11:30pm. I had been traveling from Porto Portugal since 10:00 the night before. Just like they ask for bump volunteers why not ask for luggage volunteers? Luckily I got to pay $60 for two suitcases to not fly with me.
Dec 2019,50,Good flight - ahead of schedule,We traveled from Chengdu to San Francisco on UA8. The flight was on time departing and arrived ahead of schedule. We traveled with two dogs and had an empty seat between us.
Dec 2019,30,"Same class, big difference","I really will comment on the two flights (Chicago to Sao Paulo and back).    Going was awesome. The business class space (re-branded as Polaris) was awesome. Great space and privacy. New cabin furniture. Very well thought with good spaces that really made the flight comfortable for working, eating, relaxing and sleeping.  Coming back... was surprisingly different. Same plane, same class, but few rows behind (5 rows to be precise). Totally different: the seat was old - I had some issues to make it bed as it was not working well - no privacy, no well thought spaces. Big disappointing change!  Don't get why, if you are in the same plane & class, you get two different significant things. One was like being in this XXI century, the other was like going back to the 1980's...  Still, it was business and the attention, overall, was good."
Dec 2019,30,Who did it.,On my out bound flight to Portland my boarding pass indicated TSA prescreening. My return flight did not contain the TSA PRESCREEN thus I had to go through full security screening. I called United they said the problem was not with United Airlines but with the travel site. Of course the travel site said the problem lied with the airlines.
Dec 2019,50,United Airlines to Turks and Caicos,"Love United! I usually never have issues with this airline. I'm not jammed into the seats and there actually is leg room. I usually fly business class with work but this was a vacation and I was pleasantly satisfied with economy. Plus, they had wifi that I could use for my iPad to pass the time"
Dec 2019,30,An exhusted cabin crew who tried their best,"The cabin crew did everything they had to. Safety checks, beverage service, meal service, etc. They looked like they had 1/2 hour of rest. I know the FAA rules but things happen. Once dinner service was complete I think the cabin crew passed out. (not really)"
Dec 2019,50,Nice flight,"Every thing was above expectations  Team was very professional and friendly  Seats comfortable, food good  Definitely recommend"
Dec 2019,40,Family holiday to New York City,"Fab airline. Amazing staff never stopped during the flight looking after everyone.  Biggest let down was the food on both journeys.  We were sat towards the back and as the food was served from front to back, we got no choice and basically given what was left or do without!!  Better preparation needed.  I would definitely use again, but be prepared to take more of our own food onboard."
Dec 2019,20,Like riding on a cattle car,"On time, yes. Boarding as expected, yes. But that’s about all I can say positive. The flight entertainment was fair, the cleanliness was fair. Seats after the upgrade were tolerable. The staff was indifferent, the service barely polite, and the quality of the food was horrible. We fly internationally often and on a number of different carriers. The ONLY good thing about this flight was its route. It is one of the only directs to Singapore. If you can find something else, take it!"
Dec 2019,20,Stuck in Chicago,Well we were leaving Moline for a trip to Alaska but our plane had some mechanical problems so we had to wait. Then thunderstorms came in to Chicago so we couldn’t take off when the plane was ready. We missed our connection so we were stuck in Chicago. We called our cruise company and they got us on Alaska Air to Seattle. Then they got us on Alaska Air to Anchorage . We finally got on a flight in Anchorage to Fairbanks. We basically were flying or waiting at Airports for about 20 hours. We were kind of tired when we got there. Not real happy with United.
Dec 2019,20,What you get when the airlines are in control,"It's a sellers' market for air travel. The airlines have a monopoly over many routes, and it's apparent that they really don't care about customers' comfort or opinion. United Airlines is a successful business, making a large profit, so why do the seats get smaller and smaller, and there is a price for every incremental change that night may a trip more comfortable. After flying for many years on many different airlines, I find the gouging of customers truly reprehensible."
Dec 2019,50,Very Uneventful Flight (happy to say),"We were flying back home to Chicago after my husband became ill on our vacation to Las Vegas. After spending 5 weeks there, he was finally cleared to fly home. United helped me to secure the proper paperwork to allow oxygen on the flight and really treated us with a lot of respect and courtesy. Anyone who has ever traveled with someone who is ill can appreciate it when someone goes out of their way to be kind. The United personnel, both on the ground, and in the air, did just that. They were kind."
Dec 2019,40,"boarded on time at Chicago, althoough the boarding took place in the rain. One hour mechanical delay - missed Stockholm","Delay in Chicago resulted in missed flight in Stockholm. Flight was ten hours. Bathrooms had lines of people waiting, but not terrible. They obtained a new flight later in the day."
Dec 2019,40,Flying to Kona,We have traveled to Kona yearly for several years. Our journey starts from CVG to SFO. We spend a night and fly United direction from SFO to Kona. We choose to take the first morning flight to get into Kona in the early afternoon. The direct flight is a little more expensive than going through Honolulu but saves time and frustration associated with layovers and baggage issues. In the past few years the planes have all been 737 and this year was a 737 Max which I will say was more comfortable than older models. This was just before they were grounded. We usually spend first 1-2 nights at Hilton resort and then rent a condo in Kialua Kona. Return flight to SFO. Spend night at Hilton and final leg the next day. Breaking flight into legs makes it much more comfortable and frankly tolerable.
Dec 2019,50,Excellent Customer Care`,"I booked a flight for my 86 year old mother to come visit from Seattle to Charlotte. The second stage of the flight was from Denver to Charlotte. As she was waiting to board, the lady at the gate presented her with a ticket to first class. This was extremely generous. She is not very mobile so the extra attention, early boarding and big seat were great. It was an all day adventure and a very long day for an elderly lady so I am greatly appreciative of the great care you gave to her."
Dec 2019,50,"Very professional crew, flight on time and service on board was great.","Was very impressed with the whole trip, the ground crew at LA were there ready to guide you and were very helpful and friendly."
Dec 2019,40,Buy Leg Room,"We buy basic economy which has its limitations. You are permitted one carry on and one personal bag for free. Since basic economy boards towards the end of the line, room in the overhead compartments gets filled. So they just let you check your bag (for free) at the gate. That works fine. It does add a stop at the baggage center at the end of the trip, but it means you don't pull your carry o luggage around at a lay over airport.  We paid for the extra leg room. They assign you a seat (when basic economy) at check in, so you can see what is available. BY exit doors is really roomy."
Dec 2019,10,AVOID!!!,"All around horrible! We flew from LAX to Newark and had a connecting flight to Scotland. Our flight there was delayed 2.5 hours. Luckily, we were able to find an earlier flight so we wouldn’t miss our flight to Scotland. Once we arrived at LAX UNITED staff was rude and unwilling to help people asking for help. Airplane seats were uncomfortable and TV screens old and slow. My screen was set on a different language and I was unable to change it back to English. On the way back our flight to Newark was once again delayed. We landed at 1400 hours and had our flight for 1500 hours. Took forever to get off the plane and forever to get our bags. Even when rushing to get to our plane it was mission impossible. Once again staff was RUDE and unwilling to assist. They were able to schedule us onto the “next available” at 1800 hours. There was a flight at 1600 but stated they couldn’t guarantee us both seats, even when online it showed there was seats. When we asked if we could just rebook our own we were told no. Likely to book with United again= NONE!"
Dec 2019,50,Great trip on a red eye !,A group of guys flew from Houston to Lima to help in the construction of a church. This flight was a better one than some of the United trips I've taken in the past years. The service was really good and the meals we were served all were just right. United has moved up a notch in my book!
Dec 2019,50,Best International Flight in a long time,"United Polaris cabin is amazing for a 11+ hour flight. Friendly& helpful flight crew, on time departure & Arrival along with excellent food. The salmon with red curry was restaurant quality & delicious. Baggage arrive in a timely manner! Excellent job UAL! ."
Dec 2019,50,Great travel experience on United,"I had a great flight on United in October from Kansas City, Mo to Denver, Co. The seats were comfortable, flight attendants were attentive and it was a good flight."
Dec 2019,40,Good news bad news,"Let’s just say the airport in Redmond, RDM, is top notch. The staff there are helpful and friendly, always. It is a very clean airport.  When I flew out to Denver last week, the flight was delayed due to last minute short staffing. They made us walk a good 1/4 mile to get to the plane, which is outside, and we had to wait on a very cold and windy ramp while people put up their bags and sat down. Then we had to wait for luggage to be loaded onto the plane. We were delayed about 1 hour.  The flight was a little turbulent and they requested we sit for much of the descent.  Many of these things could not be helped, and the flight attendants kept a positive attitude through all of the little setbacks. Fortunately, I did not miss my plane and my connecting flight was smooth as well."
Dec 2019,40,TO and FROM Chicago,"DO NOT GET Basic Economy! They don't even let you take a wheels on bag on the plane! The seats are so tight they're claustrophobic. One good thing was they did give an early option to take a later flight when the weather was bad, and even offered vouchers or points online! The flight attendants were cool."
Dec 2019,40,Flight to NY,"Slightly delayed flight, however acceptable.  Laguardia Airport, United, has new terminal (remodeled) thumbs up!"
Dec 2019,50,The plane was comfortable and roomy. The staff was exceptional and wanted the passengers to enjoy their trip.,Comfortable with plenty of legroom. The food was good and the service was exceptional. The entertainmrnt kept me busy all during the 8 hour flight. Thank you United!
Dec 2019,30,FREEZING FLIGHT,"United airlines flight from Cancun to O’Hare was terrible..  The whole time it was freezing... I had caught a runny nose!  I had a sweeter and a hoodie on and it was still that cold.    The outlets to charge your phone were NOT usb compatible, you had to actually have your charging cube with you..    I would chose American Airlines over United next time"
Dec 2019,50,Amazing Respect for WWII Vet,"On Tuesday after Thanksgiving, my WWII veteran husband and I flew from Atlanta, GA to Columbia, MO, changing planes in Chicago. My 94 year old husband was wearing his B-29 Super Fortress-WWII cap. We were met at O'Hare by a man on an oversized golf cart, who delivered us to the gate for the last leg of our flight. Because of his wheelchair status, we were invited to load first. He was escorted to the door of the plane where he needed assistance to cross the threshold. We were met at the door by a flight attendant. A pilot, maybe co-pilot, was standing at door of the cockpit. When he saw my husband's hat, he insisted on accompanying him to his seat and putting his carry-on bag in the overhead bin. That in itself, was amazing. As the plane loaded,as well as when we unloaded an hour later in Missouri, numerous people, primarily men, stopped to greet my husband and/or thank him for his service to our country. It was an amazing moment of respect for a veteran of the US Army Air Corps. Thanks to the pilot and United Air Lines for creating an atmosphere that allowed people to take time to greet an old fly-boy!"
Dec 2019,50,"Flights were on time, and service great!","All Flights were on time, great options for flight times. Service was great, jets were in great condition"
Dec 2019,50,Pay more for a good seat!,Very pleasant flight in this section and will use it again. Especially thought the seats were comfortable and the food above average!
Dec 2019,30,"It left on time and it arrived on time. These days, that is all one really should expect.","The flight departed and arrived on time. The cabin crew were either rude to us or ignored us. By ""us"", I mean everyone, not just my wife and me. To get my wife's attention, the lady serving us called her ""you"", as opposed to, for example, ""madam"". As for me, I was in the aisle seat and she simply poked me to get my attention. I have flied United before and expect very little. It is partners in alliance with Air Canada, so I know to expect very little. And that is what we got."
Dec 2019,40,Good flight. Lack of flight availability (NY to PVR) and extremely high fares.,Flight was good availability and price stunk. With no competition on this route United charges whatever they want.
Dec 2019,40,"A good flite shouldn,t be interesting","On time, no problems if you have extra short legs. No turbulence andgood weather both departing and landing"
Dec 2019,50,15 hour flight,The cabin crew was great on feeding us every 4 hrs or so and blacking out all the windows on the airplane so we all could sleep or watch movies.
Dec 2019,40,Easy to get upgraded to Merida,If you have any status at all you will get upgraded to first class on this flight in both directions. For most cities I am usually 28 to 40 on the upgrade list. I am 4 for 4 on flights to Merida and normally there are still 1 or 2 empty seats in First.
Dec 2019,30,Good one-time experience but not super comfortable for long flights,"In Basic Economy, I could not choose my seat, which was fine. However I also was not allowed a full carry-on bag, only a personal item. That isn't so terrible but I had to pay $30 to check my carry-on bag, so I probably should have not flown 'basic' and just paid a little more. It was a long flight with layover in Chicago and the seats barely move for the 'recline' position. Otherwise, the experience was fine. Friendly people, flights were on time, no delays, nothing terribly stressful. I did not use the entertainment system so I can't comment on that. I had an outlet at my seat to charge my phone on the first flight but not on the second flight, but I did survive without the extra charge."
Dec 2019,20,Poor Service,Will never fly United again. We flew with United due to our international carrier using United for our domestic leg of flight.  The experience at Newark airport was the worst we have ever experienced at any airport.  It started at the kiosk with a staff member speaking abruptly and telling us we would have to pay $400 USD to check in our bags dispute us telling them and showing them confirmation that we had an allowance of 2 bags per person. This person then sent us to line up at customer service were we lined up for approx 30 mins waiting for service due to the staff arguing with each other and staff refusing to work at the service desk due to “hating that job”. These discussions where loud in front of passengers.  Finally a lady has come from the kiosk to serve at the desk and gave us bag tags and boarding passes however we lost the seats we had together and where sat in middle seats and offered to pay an additional couple of hundred dollars to upgrade to a window seat so we could sit together.  It was such a distressing experience made worse by when landing in Houston and having an hour to make our connecting flight (all booked by international carrier). Having never been to this airport before and lack of signage we attempted to ask staff for assistance on where to go they would not answer our question and told us we needed to go back to the gate we got off the plane if we needed assistance.  We found our own way to the next flight however our bags did not and missed the flight!  With so many airline options I would suggest you look elsewhere and avoid United airlines.
Dec 2019,40,Very good flight after late departure,Very good flight after 45-50 minute late departure.  Very good customer service (Check-In & In-Flight)
Dec 2019,50,Direct flights rock!,So happy not to have to worry about tight connections or waiting for hours in a foreign airport with nothing to do!
Dec 2019,20,Take the bus don't fly,"A nightmare! scheduled departure was 7:!5pm it kept getting pushed back and finally left the gate at 9:15pm, than enroute to EWR we circled around PHL for about a half hour before continuing North. We didn't land in EWR til 11 ish than couldn't get a gate, so another 20+ mins went by. We literally took the Bolt Bus on our return to DC, without any delays or issues. (and no security lines and hassles)."
Dec 2019,40,"TImely Departure, Reasonably Comfortable Seats","The flight left on time, arrived on time. Food service was quite slow, but we weren't hungry so no problem."
Dec 2019,20,Questionable food and service,Flew first class from Chicago to Tampa on Saturday morning for business  They ran out of egg dish and gave us bowl of corn flakes and a yogurt  Service was so slow even though they had two people servicing 20 guests  Maybe time to rethink the value of first class or another airline
Dec 2019,40,Good flight!,"Our flight was on time and aside from the narrow seats, it was a good flight. My movie screen stopped working at one point, and I had to talk to 3 different attendants before it was sorted out. Also, the toilets were nice and clean at the beginning of the flight, and had deteriorated considerably toward the end. More attention to maintaining them better would have been nice."
Dec 2019,20,No one at United counter to provide our bags,"Our bags were sent on an earlier flight. This has also been done before.  Your bags are not put out for you (at the Midland airport) to pick up, once you’ve arrived. You have to hunt someone down to get your bags, and this is very difficult to do. Everyone else had their bags already and were gone. We were still standing there waiting for someone to bring our bags. Took about 40 - 45 minutes to get our bags after we got off the plane (in a very small airport).  Plane landed at about 9:00 PM. We left there about an hour later.  They rarely put out first class bags first."
Dec 2019,30,Economy to Europe,This was a very long flight and considering the length of flight economy was ok. It was not as constructed as I remember economy being.
Dec 2019,40,Chicago to Sao Paulo,"Good trip, nice crew, and a good plane. On-time and all went well while aboard and after arrival. Overall, a very normal a good flight."
Dec 2019,20,Sad American Airline,"Sad showing, the plane was old, as were the flight attendants, the food was unacceptable, ours was delivered cold and they could not do anything about it, plus they ran out of chicken by the time they got to my seat in the back. We were not offered any drinks during the flight, other when they served food, not hot towel before we landed. The bathrooms were very smelly! this was a full flight on Thanksgiving day - very disappointing"
Dec 2019,20,Uncomfortable Seats,"Seats were really uncomfortable. Will try to fly with another airline next time. On the way back, we were on Lufthansa, and that was a nightmare. Delayed flight and running through airport concourses to make connecting flights. And Lufthansa sent our luggage on the flight which left Rome nine hours after we did. The Fiumicino Lufthansa employee also did not give us receipts for the luggage which made it more stressful. They did send an email receipt, but I didn't check email till the next morning since we got back much later than expected."
Dec 2019,50,Great crew.,"Great crew. Friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. Comfortable leg room but the seats could be a little wider."
Dec 2019,40,"Delayed 45 minutes flying home on United, but well taken care or.","I am a premier member of United, fly frequently and get well taken care of. Unfortunately there was a 45 minute delay on return flight. Throughout the flight, they kept updating the connecting flights on the intercom and gave clear instructions on what to expect. If you miss your connecting flight, new flight automatically arranged and if you need to spend the night, they will accommodate and pay for room and food."
Dec 2019,10,Racing for the plane,Very bad for connecting flights Eve if I had a almost 3 hrs of waiting time. As always the first one was delayed and the rest is the same story as always. You're doing pretty bad! There is a lack of control on the selling more than you can provide.
Dec 2019,20,Had to pay for carry on luggage,I have flown all over & never had to pay for carry on luggage. The explanation was I had a economy price & I must check luggage...WTH???? I will not fly United again!!!
Dec 2019,50,"Love flying United, thank you!!",Great round trip flight. Couldn't be any better. Wish all planes had chairback screens. See you in May!!
Dec 2019,10,United the worst airline ever!,The airline lost my luggage and three days later call me to ask me why my suitcase was in Newark when my flight was Houston to Bogota. Finally the suitcase arrived totally destroyed. Besides when you buy the ticket online they tell you that all taxes are included and when you arrive at the airport they charge you an additional one.  The worst airline ever!
Dec 2019,40,Great flight,"My first long haul flight and as a nervous flyer I was pretty apprehensive. I needn't have worried. The flight was on time, the seats were spacious and comfortable for economy class. Food was good and the crew were friendly and efficient. There was lots of choice for the in flight entertainment and the time flew by (sorry for the pun!). The return flight was just as good and I'd have no hesitation in recommending United Airlines."
Dec 2019,30,It is okay.,"The flight was round trip, both ways it was very full. It is during the night and the films were okay."
Dec 2019,50,Great commuter flight,"I've taken this flight several times, and they all went well. The plane is clean and comfortable for a 2 hour flight. The crew is pleasant. I was. upgraded to first once."
Dec 2019,40,We love to fly United,"We always love flying United when we go to the States. Great customer service, great everything. We are completely satisfied even when delayed."
Dec 2019,50,On time,The flight departed late from Cancun but we made the time up & still arrived early!!!! The attendees were very responsive & helpful.
Dec 2019,40,Richmond/Chicago/San Fran,The flight from Ric to Chicago was full as it was a morning flight to there and then full from Chicago to San Fran. United's WiFi stinks and with everyone using their app the movie kept buffering.
Dec 2019,40,RDU to CHINA,"Flight was good but long. Seats were nice, Food was good. I'm kind of tall, and could almost lay down flat. Return was slightly shorter, and similar. They do try to get you to sleep just after serving the main meal."
Dec 2019,30,Flight from UK to Huston,"The flight was in itself quite reasonable, the main problem was the food service, which was in the case of my wife was called pasta, which was almost solid lump, and very dry.  I cannot eat pasta due to doctors orders, so had take the second choice which I was told was chicken, in fact Tikal masala, not something I would eat normally but which was not good. I asked if there was anything they, could provide, Evan just bread unfortunately nothing was available. Considering the cost of this flight after upgrading, I was extremely disappointed in the customer service."
Dec 2019,50,It was a great flight with kids,No complaints here. We sailed through security and tried every restaurant in the terminal then had an uneventful flight to Maui. The inflight service was great and they were helpful with the kids. Would fly this airline anytime.
Dec 2019,50,"Overnight business class Newark, NJ to Rome, Italy","If one suffers from claustrophobia, this trip is impossible! For me, in the center position, better than my wife's outer space which was so crowded and uncomfortable as to make sleep absolutely impossible. Also, a 2-week course in how to use these sleeper seats is necessary before boarding the aircraft as one of normal intelligence would find using the controls impossible to make the seats/beds useable. Neither of us felt any benefit from paying the price for business class."
Dec 2019,10,THE WORST,An absolutely nightmare. Overcrowded. Flight attendants were awful and rude. It is very difficult to avoid United because their prices are generally amongst the lowest but paying a little more for better treatment is a small price to pay.
Dec 2019,40,Love to travel,"Excellent flight, plenty of room,great service, food was mediocre, great hot chocolate chip cookies. Bathroom nice and clean. The flight attendants were extremely attentive and brought warm wash cloths. Would like to see a direct flight from Orlando to Honolulu or Tampa to Honolulu tho!"
Dec 2019,50,Perfect!,Travelled with United on what was one of the busiest weeks of the year i.e. Thanksgiving. Checkin at O’Hare Chicago was seamless with lots of staff on hand to ensure no queue buildup. Flight which was fully booked departed on time due in the main to great checkin process i.e. boarded by sector which was very controlled and therefore avoided any hassle. Onboard service was excellent with patient friendly crew. Luggage was delivered without delay.Overall very positive experience on what was our first time flying with United. Will not be our last!
Dec 2019,50,Great service,"Great service, flight attendants were friendly and helpful. Not doubt will do it again. The flight was smooth."
Dec 2019,50,United’s New look,Just took United out of west palm to Newark . Great flight new plane . Flight Attendants were great and service was excellent
Dec 2019,50,Fantastic flight,Loved flying this flight out of the springs airport. United was very professional and even though weather was awful the staff were great!!!
Dec 2019,50,Apple Country,We traveled from Chicago to Seattle and then drove to Yakima. The flights were both excellent. We arrived at both destinations on time and had great service by the attendants.
Dec 2019,50,Excellent flight in new Polaris seat,"Excellent flight in seat 1F in the new Polaris seat on a 787-10 from SFO to EWR. Flight was 3 hours late due to weather, but the crew was extremely professional and friendly. This is my first time back on United in a while - gave them up several years ago due to the service and operational issues after the merger. I think the friendly skies are back and I am a fan."
Dec 2019,50,First class,"I was scheduled to fly economy but upgraded to first class for my flight to Las Vegas. Glad I did. The crew of course was attentive, and the flight was so smooth, we got in half an hour early! If you ever want the experience of a life time try going 1st once, it will spoil you."
Dec 2019,10,Just awful,"Flew the (newish) Dreamliner, which was an ok aircraft. Better than the A380, in my opinion.  But the cabin crew were just awful. Miserable, angry, uncommunicative, unhelpful. Would it really hurt to smile occasionally? Or at least, be sociable, and answer questions with more than a grunt?  At the end of the flight, you may be inclined to be a bit more forgiving of this attitude, but at the beginning? Give me a break.  There was no information anywhere about what the meal selections were. Not in the magazine, not on the TV screen. But ask what the choices are, and you get the response, ""Chicken or beef!"" Chicken Cacciatore, or Chicken Schnitzel, or Honey Chicken? ""Chicken or beef!""  To rub salt into the wound, they ran out of mains, and sandwiches. Not that any of it was edible. Maybe they were doing the passengers a favour.  My daughter and her family have just flown the same route with United, and report exactly the same attitudes.  Worst flight ever. Never again."
Dec 2019,30,"In a greedy world, eisle sit is far fetch!","I only wanted an eisle seat! So surprized to discover (2 weeks before) that all available seats are gone and also the paid ones are gone. UA representative on the phone told me there a ""preferd sit"" in the middle for about $160!!!! Never thought it would come that far in flights.....Airlines become so greedy!  Good point for UA is for hiring Hebrew speaking stuards. Food between meals is also avaiilable at the gully. Coffee/tea/water is also available."
Dec 2019,30,Only 1st class amenity was the leg room,Food mediocre and service indifferent. Wheelchair service forgotten and almost missed connection Delta on the way home a welcome difference.
Dec 2019,20,Ground Crew at Dinner??,"Hey, know it's the holidays and travel can be trying, to say the least, but when our flight from Chicago to Appleton WI landed yesterday (on time-4:40pm), there was no ground crew to bring the plane into the gate. Were they at dinner or something? We sat out on the tarmac for more 20 minutes(the natives were definitely restless)waiting for someone to show up. This is not some busy airport and United had no other flights at any gate at the time, so again I ask: What's up with that? And then, when they did show up, it took another 15+ minutes to get gate-checked carry-on luggage to passengers. I have flown into Central WI Airport (CWA) and this never happened to me. Get it together Appleton (ATW)"
Dec 2019,40,It has to be a Better Way,"After traveling 11 hrs from Tel Aviv, not counting how long I/we were up prior to departure. Returning to our own country waiting in line after line to go through another TSA check point where there wasnt any compassion for our group of United passengers, they even took our bottle water away that United gave us and threw it away! So sad that bottled water that was given by your airline would be taken from us that have traveled all night and we weren't able to ""buy"" a bottle of water until we was well passed the TSA check point! The most disturbing incident was when a monitor sent me all the way to another long line when I had made it up to the front of my section! Unfortunately I couldnt see her name, but she wasnt a nice person at all"" Just some one with a ""little Authority""! I hope my future flights will be better and I hope to Avoid Newark in the future!"
Dec 2019,20,Poor customer service,"Our flight was delayed leaving London which caused us to miss our connection. Once we arrived in Washington the man who was working Customer service in terminal A was very unhelpful. We wanted to get home that night and asked about flying to multiple different places and connecting and he did not even look anything up. He just kept saying “we don’t have any flights tonight”. The only thing he offered was to send us to Houston (which is no where near Huntsville, Alabama) and we could then Fly home the next day. That would have solved nothing except another plane trip. When I asked about where I could get a hotel he told me he was not allowed to help me with that. Luckily Washington airport has a volunteer program called Travelers aid and she was brilliant. She was most helpful and accommodating. The man who worked with us (customer service) really needs to find a job he enjoys because this clearly is not it."
Dec 2019,40,2019 Visit to Family,"We fly quite often to visit family using United and despite stories circulating that they aren’t a very good airline, we have ever had any complaints, in fact on one occasion I was unwell, and the crew were exceptionally circumspect.    Again I found the crew to be very pleasant. The Captain was very apologetic when he had to return from the runway just prior to our turn to takeoff as his instruments showed that the cargo had been loaded incorrectly - much better to be safe than sorry, and we didn’t have to wait an inordinate amount of time for another slot. The flight was without incident and we made up some of the lost time.    My only complaint is that United’s gates couldn’t be further from Terminal 2’s departure lounge at Heathrow, but then if it was closer, it might be reflected in the price charged."
Dec 2019,40,"December 5, 2019","Boarding was very efficient and quick. I set in Economy section 22c. Seats were comfortable, being my first time on United Airlines I was pleasantly surprised. The play was smaller and seats were more roomy. Only had two seats on each side of plane not three. Will start flying United from now on! Stan H."
Dec 2019,40,Loooong Flight,I upgraded to premium economy for my flight TO Sydney - it was worth it. I did not do that for my return flight - don't know why. (probably just too cheap) This is a 17 hour non-stop flight and it can be a very long 17 hours. Flight was on time. Crew was friendly and helpful. Aircraft was clean. Score one for United.
Dec 2019,30,Just Ok,Fight Attendance nice. Fair seats. It's United what can I say.  Luggage was on time this time. Snacks are not worth the free price.
Dec 2019,30,Napa trip,The flight was good. Service not the best. I bought something to eat- did not receive any utensils and it was very hot. Asked for utensils and still did not receive them. So I returned the item and did not pay for it. The flight attendant was disgusted with me. Not pleasant at all. I asked if I could have another drink and was told I could not. Asked if I could have a cookie since I did not eat my purchased item and was told no. I do enjoy flying United- maybe it was just an off day for her but clearly I should not have been treated the way I was.
Dec 2019,20,"Uniteds rep for lousy logistics got confirmed yet again, at least he cabin attendants did a great job","- No information at check in, had to walk back to get a sticker for my boarding pass  - Unclear boarding instruction caused lot of confusion  - Plane had to taxi around on ground at Houston for 20 minutes looking for a ""free"" spot to disembark  - At least the cabin attendants did a great job"
Dec 2019,30,"Too. Hot, too cramped","First off, I get it. Airlines are in the business to make money. But now they charge for luggage, some charge for carry-ones, extra legroom, etc. I think that is enough but no, they have added more seats with less legroom and you just about have to become intimate with your row mates and the row in front of you to get in or out of your seat.  This flight is exactly like I described above. Not only that it was hotter than Hades and even with the air vent blasting full on, it was too hot for comfort.  If I wanted to fly with absolutely no basic comforts I would subject myself to Allegiant or other low-cost airlines. This was United and they have taken the same dark path the other airlines have and for that, I am very sad and disappointed."
Dec 2019,30,Delayed,"Were told of a delay when we arrived to the airport. The entire time I was checking the website it said on time. I could have stayed at the hotel longer instead of being stuck at the airport. The delay was caused by a backlog in Newark, which they knew of long before 2 hours prior to the flight. This flight also had no inflight entertainment system and the person in the seat behind me kept putting his legs under my seat all the way into my area. No matter how many times I asked him to move them, he put them right back."
Dec 2019,50,Customer care second to none,Absolutely fantastic airline.On board food was amazing.Cannot find any faults whatsoever. The staff were brilliant and even though I was travelling economy it was great.Next time I go to the states I will without doubt fly with this airline
Dec 2019,50,Great Flight,"Great flight. Boarded quickly, left exactly on time and arrived 30 minutes early. Personal in flight entertainment system always makes the flight go quicker. All the staff were pleasant and accommodating. Very nicely done by all."
Dec 2019,10,Delayed about 2 hours,Just didn’t like flying with United at all. The bathrooms were not working properly.  That is all I have to say at this time because we are going to fly with United unless  That is all there is to flying.
Dec 2019,30,Just fine,"Nothing was going to knock your socks off but nothing was offensive either! The staff arnt the friendliest but neither are they rude. Our plane out was much newer than the return. It was clean. I ordered vegetarian. They made the Vegetarian meal the same offering to the Vegan, Lactose free and gluten free meals! My meal was disgusting! Infact, revolting. They could have tried harder for sure. I declined the meal on the way back. Plenty of room for improvements."
Dec 2019,50,NOT AFRAID TO FLY UNITED ANYMORE!,"The flight was lovely. I thought OH NO UNITED.... I've heard awful things.... but it was the best flight for us.... So I braced myself for marginal service and bad food.... I was SURPRISED.... It was lovely, the flight crew was friendly and attentive, the food was OK and over all the service was great.... NOT AFRAID TO FLY UNITED ANY MORE!"
Dec 2019,40,"On time, quick, easy and while short flights still managed beverage service","Overall the flights were good, on-time, friendly, and mostly clean. One flight did have a bad urine smell at the beginning and another had no working water for hot beverages."
Dec 2019,10,Never United!,"United employees have an attitude of, “ not my problem”. Very robotic. Terribly uncomfortable planes, old and dirty. Ugh. Give me Alaskan or Hawaiian any day. If you book a United economy , as some people need to do for economic reasons, you are Scum!,"
Dec 2019,10,Avoid United at O’Hare!,"I trusted that this big airline with its own hub at O’Hare would be able to handle minor mishaps such as an early snowstorm and still get passengers to their destinations in a timely manner. Boy was I wrong! While I could understand snow complication, my flight was actually delayed not by snow but by lack of pilots and then mechanical trouble with the plane. After waiting 5 hours to depart, United cancelled the flight and offered to rebook us 24 hours later!!! I missed a day of work, lost pay, and was not compensated even though the fault was United’s (-it was not the snow.). In following up I was given the brush-off by CustomerCare (who clearly did not care!) I would not fly this route with this airline again!"
Dec 2019,30,Lucky it was a short flight,"First, the good: United Express now has a daily jet flight from Prescott's regional airport to Denver International (and to LA), so we don't have to drive to PHX. The airport is minutes from our home and parking is free. Now the bad: the aircraft is a Canadair, which has the smallest, most uncomfortable seating we've ever experienced. The regional carriers' gates at DEN are so far from the main entrances that it took us nearly an hour to get through security and to our gate (which seemed as if it were in Utah or Wyoming). The plane was late leaving the gate, and taxied endlessly. Then the pilot announced that the plane was originally slated for a farther destination, and carried too much fuel, so it had to park off to the side for 20 or 30 minutes, engines revving noisily, to burn off fuel--not exactly a confidence-builder. To be fair, convenience trumped discomfort."
Dec 2019,20,Could be a lot better,The flight attendant was great. The food was bad. Too crowded. Will fly Lufthansa back to Houston next time.
Dec 2019,10,2 unplanned nights in Newark after a great long weekend in New York.,"We were scheduled to leave Newark at about 6 p.m. then spent the maximum 3 hours on the tarmac before being sent back to the terminal because of bad weather. We were told we would probably take off by 10:30 p.m. At 11, we were informed our flight was cancelled and the next available flight would be 2 nights later. Airlines around us were taking off after the weather calmed down and the destinations were in our same directions. United said their staff had worked long enough for the day and were sent home. Then, the line to the help desk was hours long. We decided to take the flight out in 2 days. The rigamorol we had to get out luggage was ridiculous and time consuming. We couldn’t go 48 + hours without clothes and meds. We did encounter a very pleasant helpful employee at the luggage retrieval area who went above and beyond for us. It was a nightmare I don’t want to relive. We were offered nothing for our inconvenience and spent several hundred dollars more for hotel and food. United- - never again!"
Dec 2019,20,Cancelled trip - expenses incurred not reimbursed,Our flight was cancelled without any notice. Weather the previous day messed up flights for two days on the east coast.    To get to EWR we had to fly into a different state and then take buses and trains to get the rest of the way. United wouldn't reimburse any of the expenses as the delay wasn't long enough. Sad.
Dec 2019,40,Generally on time,Dependable airline with usually good service and on time arrivals. This flight was a little rough but most are pretty calm. Fly them regularly
Dec 2019,30,Don't go through Newark to Canada,If you're going to Canada or more importantly to Nova Scotia don't take United via Newark airport. Take Air Canada direct if possible or Air Canada through Montreal.
Dec 2019,10,Typical United Crap flight,"Served uneatable and cold pasta dinner before beverage service at 5:30 so stewardesses could go sit on their fat rears. Charge an arm and leg for Premium Econ and give you nothing but 5 inches of leg room, no drinks or better food - nothing. Another example of an airline taking all - ALL the fun out of flying. Too bad they didn't stay in bankruptcy and replaced by a customer friendly airline."
Dec 2019,30,Night flight,"Long flight (~9 hours). On time. Nothing really to recommend or complain about. The seat was comfortable (but in business class it sure should be). Laid flat, so able to get some sleep.  Business class only about half full (if that). Wondering why they don't open up to make upgrades easier?"
Dec 2019,30,Decent airline but connections with other airlines needs work,"We paid extra for the seats with the extra leg room which was really nice. The entertainment, food, and check-in process were are all good -- great selection of movies. My only complaint is that there is no direct flight from Rio to DC. Instead, you have to fly on Gol to Sao Paulo which is an hour in the wrong direction, so this adds a lot of additional time to an already really long flight. Also, since the connection is with a different airline, you cannot do any kind of online check or use the kiosks -- you have to go directly to the Gol desk. It was very confusing since United's website gave me confirmation numbers for LATAM airlines and for Gol airlines. Only by asking someone from Gol at the airport were we able to figure out where to go."
Dec 2019,40,Long flight,Crew in the air and on the ground were very helpful and courteous to my wife who has a physical handicap.
Dec 2019,10,Terrible customer service,"Our flight was cancelled due to plane malfunction. United did not help us at all. We finally were able to get a flight to Chicago , to Monterey Mexico. Our luggage was lost and we had to wait another day in Monterey to get a flight to Cancun. Again United airlines did not help. Finally after 3 days we got our luggage. United airlines is terrible"
Dec 2019,10,Avoid UA if you can,"unheard of-we could not even pay extra if we wanted to take a carry on. Mandatory checked bag- and had to pay for that. We also paid for EACH leg to sit together and it had to be in the back of the plane, while there were seats open in the front.  Total discrimination.  Our flight was delayed, the morning of our noon flight, which left us with 12 minutes to make our connecting flight and no one called to change the flights."
Dec 2019,40,Good Flight,"There were long lines boarding, but the lines moved quickly. Our seats had a good selection of entertainment options, generous legroom, and two snacks. We paid for the extra legroom and it was worth it.    The flight left a little late but arrived on time with an easy landing."
Dec 2019,40,"Smooth Comfortable Flight, Rude Passengers",I don't usually take the red eye but this was a reasonably comfortable flight. It left SFO slightly delayed due to the inbound flight but we made up some time in the air. The gate was comfortable and had charging devices. The on board attendants were friendly and polite. One thing - the attendants should advise those who board early and sitting in the back of the plane NOT to stow their luggage in the forward part of the cabin. This is rude and ridiculous as are those passengers who move other people's luggage around without asking them so they can squeeze theirs in. What happened to civility?
Dec 2019,20,First Class Not worth it.,"United needs a new policy for First Class. They need to learn that you should never say ""we cannot offer you drinks because we do not have liquor: You don't board them at the end. Be more available physically not by service bell call. Your face shouldn't show what a bad day you are having. Last but not least have video screen for entertainment use."
Dec 2019,30,Another wheelchair problem,"United secures wheelchair service from third party providers. United and all airlines should demand better service for its passengers. Having to wait almost an hour after arrival is unacceptable. This is simply a customer service problem that has not been considered a priority.  We are articulate and have complained, but we have seen foreign-speaking wheelchair passengers left to wait forever and have consequently missed their connecting flights. It is a disservice and an embarrassment."
Dec 2019,50,Good and on time direct from IAH to DSM - reasonable price,The flight was direct and reasonably priced. That was my reason for flying United vs SouthWest. It was on time and a full flight. The crew were great and efficient. I'll fly this same flight again.
Dec 2019,40,Pleasant flight,Flight left on time and arrived on time. The only problem was the quick turn around for the second leg of the flight in Houston. Would have been much nicer and easier if there was a direct flight to Nashville like Southwest provides. I should also mention that we if possible take advantage of economy plus for extra legroom.
Dec 2019,40,Busy to Busy,"Flew in the early morning from busy O’Hare to busy Liberty. Both airports work hard to move you along as quickly as possible. United’s employees were friendly and helpful, especially when I left my cell behind in security. I realize the problem shortly before boarding. Had the phone and was on my way without any delay"
Dec 2019,50,Fantastic Service,I have travelled with many airlines over many years and my experience with United was an extremely positive one. Professional courteous staff and extremely professional and comfortable flights.
Dec 2019,20,United Airlines Flight,"Economy flight.    ""No Carry On"" - so had to check my small Delsey hard shell 18"" carry and pay $30.  Then United Airlines cracked (10"" crack) the $100 suitcase - it is destroyed.    Got home near midnight and didn't unpack until the following evening after a 17 day Panama Canal cruise.    Their 24 hour must fill out claim at a busy airport the day before Thanksgiving just passed. I might get a $100 voucher for a flight next year (MAY NOT EVEN USED IT).    Then they hassled me about a under the seat bag with medications."
Dec 2019,40,Thanksgiving trip to visit son & family.,"Arrived early at airport, had lunch there and flight was on time. Flight was on time and arrived in PIT early. On return, with storms in midwest the return flight was a half hour late, but made up time and arrived 10 minutes late,"
Dec 2019,40,United Airlines advantage,"I have flown overseas with this airline and was very pleased with service. I hear negatives from others that I feel may be undeserved. Our round trip flight was returning with American and they are more expensive on baggage and their staff was not as friendly! Seats on all airlines in economy are uncomfortable as this was the case with United. United allowed my seat selection a month before this flight. This was not allowed on the returning airline until the night before. Overall, I prefer to fly on the least expensive airlines so baggage fees are important to know before hand! United also serves slightly better refreshments! I will continue to book United as it works well for my needs!"
Dec 2019,40,"Friendly Flight Attendants, Excellent Service","I was greeted with a pleasant smile and was surprised at the amenities offered in business class including Saks Fifth Avenue Blankets, plush pillows, slippers, a bottle of water and an amenity kit. The dinner service was friendly and efficient and I slept well in the Polaris lay flat seats. I was also served a nice breakfast before landing. Overall a wonderful flight."
Dec 2019,30,i got to read that fine print better,"the class of service pull down menu didnt list the option of ""basic economy"" which is below economy on united; ""basic economy"" means paid checked baggage or paid overhead storage, (meaning only baggage must fit below seat) and last boarding to non assigned seats. tough for a week stay, luckily didnt need anything bulky for cabo.    i have to say the fine print was there , i just didnt read it in time."
Dec 2019,50,Great flight!,"Great flight. Lovely friendly staff. Free drinks, three course lunch and a snack. Good entertainment and leg room. Very happy traveller. Would definitely use this airline again and our seats were only economy."
Dec 2019,20,Terribly run and maintained airline.,"The airplanes are out dated and very uncomfortable seating and very poor accommodations. No in-flight TV screens in seats, no real food service and or beverage service. They came around once in an eight hour flight. They screwed up the pilots schedules and our plane was delayed 7 hours so we missed the connecting flight from Guam to Palau. Lost out on a day of vacation and were pit up in a low rate motel."
Dec 2019,40,Wichita Flights,Had a pleasant flight coming back from Wichita. Ann the flight attendant was wonderful. She was friendly and courteous to the passengers. The flight was quite full and yet she manage to do her services well and remain friendly and always smiling. The flight was on time departure and arrive Denver 20 mins early.
Dec 2019,40,nice flight no problems,"we booked our flight early and everything was as promised, no delays, no problems. The stewardess even moved me to a more leg room seat at no cost because of my prosthetic leg. we paid extra money for the return trip to get the leg room. we did not know about it when we scheduled."
Dec 2019,40,UAL Travel,Overall satisfactory flight. Customer service with assisted wheelchair to the gates was very helpful.
Dec 2019,40,NYC Trip,Flights went ok. Weather delays on both legs (Killeen and Houston) going to NYC. Staff was very friendly and accommodating on all flights. Row to myself each leg!
Dec 2019,40,Flight Home,"A typical flight from LAX to Honolulu. It was what you would expect for a 6-hour flight. We enjoyed it and were able to get some sleep on the plane. The movies left a little bit to be desired, but there were enough to select from. Not sure I enjoy how United requires you to use your own device to view the movies. This can be a little bit of an issue; overall it was a good flight coming home."
Dec 2019,50,25th Anniversary Started and Ended with United,"We decided to visit Las Vegas with my brother and his wife for their 25th Wedding Anniversary. We booked First Class were not disappointed from begginning to end. The service from the arrival, our bags were immediately retrieved and check, the service on the plane was immpeccable and the flight departed and arrived on schedule and the return was the same caliber! A great trip and United was a big part of the journey!"
Dec 2019,10,"United airlines made me decide to never fly with them again, they lied to us about a canceled flight","The airport ticket counter said our flight was canceled due to crew fatigue, then changed their mind to say bad weather, we could not get the same answer from any of their employees, this trip has made me say I would walk somewhere before i would pay United 1 dollar ever again, the rest of the golfers with me say the same thing and i hope they tell all of their friends the story and they tell others."
Dec 2019,50,UA all the way!!,"we had the whole row to ourselves... great flight, great crew service. I watched 6 movies only because I was so excited (couldn't sleep - haha!). the blankets keep you warm enough on board. the food is just fine, better than most airlines I've travelled. thanks UA for the awesome flight experience!! 2 thumbs up :)"
Dec 2019,40,"Walt Okon - Flying Dulles (IAD) to Dublin, Ireland","Walt Okon - Flying Dulles (IAD) to Dublin, Ireland. This flight was completely filled. Every seat was filled. I did get an aisle seat. United charged for soft drinks; not happy for the charge. The dinner serves was OK. Nothing special. Plane was clean. Seats small. Legroom small. Flight attendants did their. Pleasant, but not friendly. They did their job."
Dec 2019,50,smmoth,A smooth fligtht in spite of a patch of sinificant turbulence. pilot knew how toget around it best he could
Dec 2019,50,Easy flight!,Easy flight though had to fly from Louisville to Chicago to get to Naples but worth it for the fare.
Dec 2019,50,"""Great Flight no issue's""","Staff, was just wonderful and food great and no delays and just a smooth flight. The flight staff was just wonderful and always service with a smile and over flight wonderful."
Dec 2019,50,Great Flight Attendance,She was great. We had a tight connection which was 15 minutes and she did her best for us to catch our next flight. And our baggages also arrived safely and on time.
Dec 2019,30,US to Thailand,"Overall the flight was ok. It was a codeshare flight with ANA (All Nippon Airways). The legs to/from Tokyo to Bangkok on ANA were fabulous...great food, relatively spacious seating, pleasant staff. The legs flown by UA consisted of very average good, crowded seating and average to below average attention by the (seemingly) weary flight attendants. (There was one exception...one male flight attendant seemed to carry the weight for the rest of the staff...perhaps he had been rested)."
Dec 2019,50,New York to LA: First Class All The Way!,"After a long day and a hectic trip to Newark Airport from my home in Manhattan, I was not looking forward to a long flight to LA. I booked at the last minute and, as a result, ended-up having to take the last seat on the plane...in First Class!!! Due to the expense, I never fly First Class but occasionally get up-graded or awarded such a seat. This time was special. The food was superb. The service exceptional and when we arrived in LA, I found myself wanted to stay onboard a bit longer!!! I really enjoyed the trip...not something I have been able to say in a very long time."
Dec 2019,40,"bad seats, rough flight",company business flight. last minute tickets. got last rear seat on aisle next to lavatory. smell was bad seat to narrow.
Dec 2019,10,Never leaves on time,Never leaves on time. I flew 4 times with them they changed gates constantly and never left on time. Will never fly with them again.
Dec 2019,20,Customer Service could use retraining,"Customer service at the counter is lacking in friendly and helpful service by the majority of reps in Orlando and Hawaii. The ones in Houston were fabulous and the flight crews were great. Overall, the ticket service reps were awful and need significant retraining in how to deal with individuals with disabilities. I highly doubt I would fly United again."
Dec 2019,20,Food,"Every time I fly with united airlines, Food gets worse.  Next time I will bring own food and snacks. But wine and beer are still free of charge."
Dec 2019,50,Great seats!,If you’re ok without a tray table-sit in the 1st row of Economy Plus seating. Even more legroom and still can store items under the seat in front of you.
Dec 2019,40,San Francisco to Auckland,"Flying from San Francisco to Auckland on United is a long 14-1/2 flight. Check-in using the premier access lane was fast and painless; the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The boarding process was smooth and efficient. The cabin crew made the flight as comfortable as possible. In-flight entertainment includes free movies, music, and games; WiFi is available for purchase. Two full meals and a snack are provided along with numerous beverage services."
Dec 2019,40,Flight to London,"I was pleasantly surprised that the flight to London, connecting in Newark going, and Houston returning. The service onboard was great, and the food was actually tasty. I used airmiles to but the ticket and upgraded to Premium Economy, which was worth the extra."
Dec 2019,20,Bad service in flight,Bad service overall in flight .....not to me but to other passengers who are happen to be Asian.....I am American Asian . So sad to see flight attendants treated these Asian passengers ....rude and not pleasant to see
Dec 2019,30,Changed our seating without telling us - not the first time,"We reserved seats 6 months in advance, using points plus a payment for economy plus. Got one update about a minor change in flight times, no problem. When we checked in day before the flight we found they'd moved us out of economy plus, to non-adjacent emergency exit seats that didn't recline. They gave us a couple of excuses that didn't hold up, but eventually were able to put us back in Economy plus, in middle seats in different rows. When we boarded, we saw that our former seats had been booked by a family of 3, but Dad subsequently upgraded his family members to business class. So, with some friendly re-arranging among economy plus patrons, we were finally able to sit next to one another on the flight over. United's eventual reply to our written objection is that they can change whatever they want, whenever they want, to meet their needs, and they'll simply refund the price we paid if they do (and if we complain)."
Dec 2019,40,Premium Plus,"Comfortable seat, enough legroom for 6'4"", nice service and much less expensive then Polaris Business Class."
Dec 2019,10,Unfortunate Customer Service,"This was a connecting flight that originated in San Antonio and connected in Houston. I had a carry-on because I did not want to check my luggage and retrieve it at Newark at 1:17am. As I was boarding my connection in Houston with my bag, we were alerted that we would have to check our luggage because there was not enough room to store any bags overhead. I was NOT happy because this meant added time upon arrival at Newark, but I dutifully checked my bag. Once on the plane I noticed there was PLENTY of overhead space for bags. ""What the heck?"" I asked the flight attendant, and she simply shrugged. Lousy customer service!!!!!"
Dec 2019,50,Pleasant flight ✈️,"I flew recently with United from Calgary to Chicago, and had a very pleasant flight, I think their service improved compared with previous years. I enjoyed this flight, direct flight in both directions.... thanks United for a safe and pleasant flight ✈️."
Dec 2019,10,late slip arrival and mechanical problems with cancelled flight,we arrived from MRY to SFO an hour advance but could not get slip for over an hour and connecting flight left. to top it off ord to msn flight was greatly delayed and cancelled and I took bus
Dec 2019,40,San Francisco to Dulles,"Flying from San Francisco to Dulles on United is a moderate 5-1/2 flight. Check-in using the premier access lane was fast and painless; the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The boarding process was smooth and efficient. The cabin crew made the flight as comfortable as possible. In-flight entertainment includes free movies, music, and games; WiFi is available for purchase. Complimentary beverage service is provided; snacks are available for purchase."
Dec 2019,30,14 hours door to door from Oklahoma City to San Francisco,"The flight was delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed - and we were given different reasons. Once boarded we waited some more - over an hour - on the plane for it to take off.  There were a number of United crew hitching rides on the plane to get back to SF, but none of them were willing to help speed up service. They sat in the back. Wouldn't even give me a glass of water."
Dec 2019,50,Great gateway to the US,"Great flight for Australians looking to travel to the East Coast of the USA, very quick transit time in Houston, beats the other hubs hands down."
Dec 2019,30,Quality of service on United long-haul flight.,"The service on 16-hour UA flight from Singapore to San Francisco was slow and food was average quality. As a Mileage Plus member for over twenty years, I am reluctant to use United Airlines again for international flights across the Pacific."
Dec 2019,50,Great flight,Airplane was new Flight was early. Excellent inflight crew and pilots. Even though I was in regular economy it was pleasant.
Dec 2019,30,Getting Better,"United is still behind Delta in improving customer experience, however, they are trying. Flights on time, CSR's in Milwaukee and Chicago were helpful and pleasant. Breakfast offerings at ORD Club near B-5 included eggs!"
Dec 2019,40,A good trip turned bad,"The flight left about an hour late but as we were flying 14 hours with a strong tail wind ti San Francisco and as i had more than a two hour layover i was sure i would make my connecting flight from SFO to LAX in time. Sadly we made up little time and arrived at SFO in the rain with about an hour and half to get my next flight. Again, sadly, we sat o the tarmac for more than 45 minutes while another plane with mechanical issues was repaired. Still i had nearly one hour to make my connection back to LA in time to get home and make an important meeting with clients in from the east coast. Sadly again, we waited more than 40 minutes for our luggage to pass through the ""transfer"" station. They said i was too late and directed me to the United help desk who booked me for the next day at 9:30 am in to Burbank airport. they took my suitcase and gave me a hotel and food voucher. At midnight i arrived at the Holiday Inn North. When i awoke at about 7 am i received a text saying my 9:30 flight was cancelled due to weather. I went to the airport to try to find another flight but all to LAX were filled as well as to Burbank. Many of these were then cancelled due to weather across the country. I was able to get a seat on a 6:30 pm flight which i took. I then waited at the SFO airport hoping to get a stand-by seat.  Obviously, i missed my very important meeting with my clients! This was not good as i am a very small women owned business and rely on my few clients.  With the help of a very supportive United Air staffer, i was finally able to get out to LAX on a 4 pm flight and arrived at my home at about 8 pm with my suitcase at Burbank which had to be picked up the next day.  all in all, my one hour flight from SFO to LAX took an extra 19 hours! This was awful. there was no reason that our flight from Singapore did not have a gate to park at or that our luggage should take nearly one hour to show up after such a long wait on the tarmac. This cost UA a great deal and all of us a great deal as well."
Dec 2019,30,Really tiny seats!! None of their free snacks are Gluten Free.,"United has some unique non-stops. Like SFO to MSN. This I like.    I think their seats are the smallest in the industry. I'm only 5'8"" and there is hardly any leg room. I feel really terrible for any one who is any taller. And heaven forbid if you are a tad heavy on your frame, or sitting next to someone who is a tad heavy. Rubbing shoulders the whole way. :-("
Dec 2019,30,Flying United from the OC to White Plains NY,"As many know, there are no non-stop flights to White Plains Westchester Cty NY (HPN) airport from the OC (SNA) and the best way to get there is through Chicago. Weather can always be an issue, (all seasons) so pray for clear skies. I'm not sure if this an issue with the United or HPN, as I learned from the United App that my checked bag had arrived on an earlier flight to HPN although upon my arrival there was a major lack of personal to assist in retrieving my checked bag. I had to wait over 45 min for an agent from Delta (I was told the United rep was gone for the day) to attempt to find my bag in a secured area."
Dec 2019,50,San Francisco to Singapore,"Flying from San Francisco to Singapore on United is a long 15-1/2 hour flight. Check-in using the premier access lane was fast and painless; the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The boarding process was smooth and efficient. The cabin crew made the flight as comfortable as possible. In-flight service included two full meals, a snack, and multiple beverage services. In flight entertainment features free movies, music, and games; WiFi is available for purchase."
Dec 2019,50,Wonderful flight from Newark to MIA,"They upgraded me with my miles and definitely worth it. My wonderful experience began by going to United Club first where there was plenty of good food, especially the soups. Then learned that I could upgrade for just 15,000 miles, which I just had enough to do. Flight was stupendous, service great, food excellent, flight on-time and plane very clean. United has really upped their game to stay up with Delta and Emirates, etc."
Dec 2019,10,Horrible Flught,"There was no check in email. We were not assigned seats on the first lag, the seats which were available were economy plus @ @27. Since it was a couple of hours to Chicago to catch the connecting flight I opted out. The connecting flight seats assignment was terrible, so I thought we could get the economy plus but it was @ $194 which was not cost efficient. I have travelled around the world and thought that for a 9 hour flight one hot meal at least will be provided. Lo and behold there was absolutely no food and the selection on the flight was nothing but finger foods. For Canadians catching an early flight as 7:44am for 2 hours with an hour for the connecting flight for 9 hours was the worst possible experience. Also, we booked our flights in October for my daughter and I and we were placed far apart in the middle of 4 passengers rows apart. Service was so poor."
Dec 2019,50,Very efficient,"Plane and overhead bins are small, however, service was excellent and plane arrived in Houston ahead of schedule"
Dec 2019,40,Always friendly,"Always a great experience flying with United. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Food, as always, is not very good quality, but sadly that's the norm nowadays so to be expected. Flights usually on time taking off and early landings have been my experience."
Dec 2019,50,Good Trip,"I have leg and back pain, so the seats in business class are much more comfortable for me. I flew on a Tuesday and the cost of the flight was less than it is on some days of the week. The food was great compared to what is on offer in economy class. The extra room and comfort was a real plus and I arrived feeling I had had a great travel experience."
Dec 2019,20,Avoid Newark airport with this aifline,The checking in procedures are chaotic and are supplemented by the rudest staff imaginable. There is no attempt to help disabled people in fact the staff we encountered seemed to glory in their rudeness and determination not to be of assistance. If possible avoid.
Dec 2019,50,Plattsburgh Intl to Dulles DC,"This is an excellent airline, especially for handicapped as they look out for you personally. We've flown twice so far. Our oldest son and his wife have flown from OH twice and most pleased. My youngest son flew 3 times this past summer and his wife flew in Oct. You do land outside at Dulles and will put up a ramp with a simple request as the stairs aren't so good for 80+ folks. We are most appreciative of their staff's assistance."
Dec 2019,50,The Dreamliner lives up to its name!,"Non-stop from Denver to Narita aboard the Boeing 787. Superb airplane and very good flight...about 9 hours. Narrow seats, of course (booo!), but great legroom (we had Economy Plus bulkhead seats). Pressurizing cabin to 5000 ft versus 8000 ft (an 787 feature) makes you feel better upon arrival (and perhaps less jet lag). Meals in Economy Plus were okay...nothing to write home about. Service was very good. Cabin ambiance is first rate with excellent lighting throughout. And, as always, transoceanic flights become a movie fest. Viewing five flicks in a row and you're there. Sleep (no matter what class you're in) is always problematic. Anyway, United gets a definite uncheck for this non-stop."
Dec 2019,40,Tucson to San Francisco,Flying from Tucson to San Francisco on United is a relatively quick 2-1/2 flight on a regional aircraft. Check-in using the premier access lane was fast and painless; the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The boarding process was smooth and efficient. The cabin crew made the flight as comfortable as possible.
Dec 2019,20,United's first class was like flying super discount Spirit Airlines big front seats.,"Very dissapointed what united airlines call first class. I flew round trip from Ft. Lauderdale to Vancouver and then from Anchorage to Ft. Lauderdale with stopovers for both flights. All flights were first class.  Except for the legroom and wide seats, it was nothing special. I should have flown economy and saved a fortune."
Dec 2019,30,Seat discomfort and staff attitude,Not service oriented and definitely not comfortable seating in economy (not as good as others as to room and under seat setup). They had an attitude when asked about boarding ahead due to handicap/disability--never encountered this on ANY other airline.
Dec 2019,40,1st time on this airline in a long time,"Took this and 2 subsequent flights on United because of not only cost but times of flights and length of flights. I hhad not flown United in a long time due to stories about service and problems. I was very surprised that the seats were roomy, plenty of room for knees, food was fine -as expected for snacks. Attendants were friendly and helpful.MY flights left on time and arrived early."
Dec 2019,50,"Honolulu to Bangalore, India","There are not many flights connecting Honolulu to India in an efficient way. I broke the journey into 2 parts, one to Guangzhou, China where I stayed in a Hotel. Hotel was Doubletree Hotel by Hilton. Since I am Gold Member on Hilton, I got to use the Executive Lounge and Room in a Special Floor for Executives. From there, I went to Inidia by Singapore Airline, which is a partner of United. The Break in Guangzhou allowed me to not get Jet Lag."
Dec 2019,50,Dreamliner,"It really is a Dreamliner. The technology in this plane is far superior to anything flying today. This, in my opinion is the future of flying."
Dec 2019,50,Interesting flight,"I am a frequent Europe visitor, and from my various experiences, I know what airlines to choose or not for this quite a long trip. My recent trip coming back from Frankfurt to Washington D.C. was a pleasant surprise. Even though I was always picked for extra search at the security checkpoints, I do not mind that - safety first. When I finally got on the plane, and because of the search I was one of the last ones, I was pleasantly surprised. I was in the premium economy class (that is what I usually do), and it exceeded my expectations. Seat and space around it felt more like a business class on other planes. Service was pleasant, and with little smile attended to my special dietary restrictions. Flight went by quickly and univentfully. There was also enough space in the overhead bin to store all the luggage, and I did not have to fight with anyone for it. Overall, food was not bad (I expected worse), amount of space was wonderful, and I got to D.C. on time comfortably."
Dec 2019,40,flight from manila,"i flew from Manila to Denver via Guam and Honolulu. the worst part was boarding in Manila. there was a weather slow down but no one told us. I finally asked one of the pilots who were also waiting and they told me what was going on. the flights were great, crews were professional and all was good once we started."
Dec 2019,50,Surprisingly amazing in flight crew.,Onboard crew took care of every little requirement and went out of their way multiple times to ensure our comfort and enjoyment. Having such a friendly team compensates for the aircraft being a little outdated and banged up.
Dec 2019,50,Great flight,The pilot walked the aisles in through the whole plane welcoming everyone before the doors were closed.
Dec 2019,40,"Comfotable, friendly flight",The flight was easy going. Staff bery  friendly! All mature host and hostesses. Nothing too much trouble. Spacious seats with decent leg room! We ended up with a spare seat next to us which was handy as my daughter flew with me and I have a bad back.
Dec 2019,40,Family Vacation Time,"The flight was very long, the staff was friendly, we had a great time. However my family that travel in Economy area had a miserable time, there is not too much leg room and the baggage allowance is very limited and there are no options for an upgrade."
Dec 2019,30,Just Your Average US Carrier,Nothing special to report. Smaller aircraft but more comfortable in coach than many larger planes. Two by two configuration. Overhead bin storage smaller than average.  Flight attendants on inbound were very good.
Dec 2019,50,Flying with United Airline,"Always love this airline...even to book a flight is easy looks for bargains with them on line is a plus ...also if you want to talk to a representative is always a pleasure. Flying in the customer service is great, beverages and movies via wifi is great too!!"
Dec 2019,30,On Time but Uncomfortable,"Flight was on time, service was good, and luggage arrived. However, economy seats were violently uncomfortable and carry-on was limited to one item. I had to put my purse into my laptop bag, which would have been problematic if my laptop bag was full. I am committed to having fresh clothing in my carry-on even when I check a bag because of lost-luggage experiences. United seemed to go out of their way to be inhospitable with this policy."
Dec 2019,30,United Airlines... sometime cheap fare isn't everything,"Good flight to San Luis Obispo, ca. via Denver from Toronto was Good. Return flight got stuck on the runway in Denver for hours due to an electrical storm. I was travelling with my 22 yr old granddaughter who must eat regularly and this became a problem. I think they could have let us know before we boarded so that we could have prepared for the lengthy stay on the runway."
Dec 2019,40,"Value for money, but can do better on customer service & cleanliness","I have taken this flight on more than 1 occasion. United premium economy is generally comfortable with ample leg space. The food and beverage options are decent (I prefer packing my own food from the airport). They typically do a round of snacks, followed by a meal option (for premium economy) and a snack again a while later. I think they serve beverages 2 times during the entire 5hr flight.    Cons: The flight attendants sometimes are pretty rude. I have not had that experience but witnessed it with other passengers (especially kids). The second thing is cleanliness - on two different occasions I have entered the seat with a stink (least they could do is use a deodoriser), but turning the fan on for 5 mins does the trick.    Since I travel for business, having power is critical, but they are known to fail frequently. and If you are in the usual economy seats - even plugging it in is difficult with the space constraint. (I am 6 ft tall and hence bending over sometimes is not possible)"
Dec 2019,40,Improved service,Big improvement in service from the last time I was on a United flight. Perhaps it was a smaller plane and the crew was a lot more friendlier.
Dec 2019,50,Excellent service,First time used United and was very impressed. The service was brilliant and food lovely. Plenty of room and was a very comfortable flight.
Dec 2019,30,Not impressed with their service,"This was my first time trying United for the cost, they were a little cheaper than the others. I am usually on American Airlines. When we booked the flight there was not an option to pick seats, didn't question the fact. We pre-checked and noticed we were not seated together. We ask upon arrival prior to boarding if there was any opportunity to be moved together. The flight was NOT sold out with availability to be seated together, for another $59 per seat. We paid and when I asked the flight attendant the reasoning, she said ... the seats would be empty anyway so we don't have to move anyone. I did appreciate her honesty but has since lost a husband/wife of purchasing future tickets from this airline. We both agree that the ""extra"" cost is worth sitting together and the customer service."
Dec 2019,40,Very convenient,"surprisingly comfortable, on time, easy transfer between flights and connections in Chicago with time for snacks"
Dec 2019,40,"United economy is still lacking leg room, but better than it was in 2015","The last time I flew United was back in 2015, on a flight to Seattle. It was my first time experiencing the shrinking of space in economy seating, and I hated it so much, I wrote letters to United, and our local newspaper. I haven’t been on a United Airplane until last month, when I went to Las Vegas.  I was impressed that it wasn’t as uncomfortable as it was 4 years ago. It seems like they have listened to the public and somehow with new technology made a small area, a bit more bearable. As for the rest of my flight with United, I was lucky with good weather, the other passenger were uneventful, and the flight crew was good. The enclosed pic was from 2015"
Dec 2019,10,A flying cattle car,My knees were hitting the seat back in front of me. In the plane most of the day and only got water and a cracker
Dec 2019,40,OK Flight,"Purchased my ticket 6 weeks in advance but still had to board in group 3. Because I knew that overhead would be mostly taken in group 3, I checked my bag ($30 x 2) each way as this was a round trip. Flight was on time and arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule. Not a fan of the expensive snacks and drinks. The ticket was pricey $769 round trip. Hard to find many nonstop trips from Cleveland."
Dec 2019,10,Stuck in Shanghai,Our flight was first delayed due to mechanical issues then postponed almost 20 hours due to FAA rules. No reach out from United. Had to scamper for 2 hotel rooms due to large business expo being held. The flight the next day was awful. Flight attendants hid most of the time in the back. Barely did their job. Food was awful. Only good thing was I got a full can of soda. After 14 hour flight I was just glad to get home.
Dec 2019,40,On time,Great job leaving and landing on time! The fight attendants were great. There was plenty of room for all of my carry on items.
Dec 2019,40,"Flight cancelled, got on another same day....okay.","Pleasant staff; competent pilot. On Time. No worries. Original flight was cancelled, so we were lucky to get on this one the same day. It would have been inconvenient and expensive otherwise."
Dec 2019,30,Always very lackluster...but reliable,"My husband & I have flown United many times, mostly within the U.S. We recently took our second international long-haul trip via United, from PHX to HND (connecting at SFO) and then from NRT to PHX (connecting at LAX). This was our longest flight with United. Typically United is not the cheapest option to fly internationally, but in this instance, we used Mileage Plus award miles and then upgraded to Economy Plus for extra legroom. United domestic flights are often very underwhelming. Even for the 5-hour flight I frequently take going between PHX and EWR, there is no included meal, only non-alcoholic drinks and snacks - at least there are snacks! The international experience is only marginally better. I requested a vegetarian meal both ways, and the meals served (lunch and breakfast) leaving the U.S. were really quite bad. Serving breakfast before landing at 3pm in the afternoon really made little sense! Meal quality was much improved on the return leg leaving from Tokyo. I enjoyed my dinner and breakfast that time, though dinner was a bit too heavy-handed on the salt. I did feel that by ordering a special meal, I got more food - for example, I was served fruit with my breakfast on the return flight, although my husband did not have any fruit with his standard breakfast. Of course, getting more food is only a plus if it is of good quality! The seatback entertainment was good - lots of movies to choose from! A+ service there! The flight attendants were nice, but no one really seemed to go above and beyond their job duties. Flight attendants seem a bit happier on other airlines we've flown as compared to United. The comfort level was OK. We had a good amount of legroom, but that's only because we purchased Economy Plus. On the long-haul flights, I really think Economy Plus is a necessity. I don't see any way to be comfortable in a standard economy seat. It truly helps to have that little bit of extra room. The cabin was pretty clean, although we've flown on cleaner aircraft through other airlines. We fly United out of convenience, sometimes due to price point, and also because we've accumulated miles (and also spend them). This is the airline we are most loyal to, but it's not because it's amazing. As long as any airline, including United, gets us there and back in one piece, that's all that really matters! But, it'd be nice to see them improve in the areas they are currently lacking in."
Dec 2019,10,Crew failed in its principal duty: safety,"In row in front of me both window seats were reclined during landing. Passenger across aisle used laptop during taxi, takeoff, and landing. Crew made announcements of rules but never looked to see if cabin was safe."
Dec 2019,30,Rapid City to Denver round trip a poor excuse for a major airline,"United uses Air Wisconsin for this route with the crappy Canadaire Regional jets. The planes are small and unable to handle standard carry-ons. Plus I question the ability of the pilots in extremely bad weather. They are always full, so it would seem that a 737 would fill the bill much better. It seems like Rapid city is a stepchild in United's routing system. On our last return flight from Denver we were 3 hours late. Then we had to wait on the tarmac for over 30 minutes because their ground crew was servicing a DELTA flight. Come to find out, United bootlegs the Delta ground crew to save money, but has no priority if there is a Delta flight at the gate. On this occasion it was way past midnight before we got off the plane. We didn't get home until after 2AM."
Dec 2019,20,Worst transatlantic economy class,"Flying United from the US to Europe was one of the least comfortable economy class transatlantic flights I’ve been on. I’ve flown British Airways and Emirates in the past year as well and their basic economy fares are in an entirely different league. United did not even have screens on the seat backs for any in flight entertainment, and for such a long flight you really need some distraction. Very cramped and uncomfortable. Employees however were kind"
Dec 2019,10,"United Airlines - Houston, TX","Horrible experience. What a disservice United gives to hundreds of travelers coming from Latin America...shame on them! Imagine arriving into Houston International to connect to your flight but having to get your suitcases, check with immigration officials, run to a different area in the airport to check again with the airline, carrying your suitcases and being told that you will loose your connecting flight if you don´t run...this is what happened to three of our four passengers in three different dates. Hundreds of people running like crazy. Broken bottles of glass everywhere, from the articles purchased in duty free from their first flight. We ran all over to get to a huge plane that United has ready to fly out with everyone trying to get to LAX. The airline only cares about the money they receive...not the service they provide. Once I arrived to LAX, I mentioned the situation to a group of United Airline staff, they all said ""oh, we have heard about Houston""..."
Dec 2019,50,Wonderful flight,Excellent service and a little more leg room than in the flights we had 2 years ago. Meals were better than the past. The check-in staff was very helpful. We would fly United as our first choice on our next flight.
Dec 2019,40,Non-stop from Denver to Maui,"Flying direct from Denver to Maui is a wonderful, even though is is a long, trip. The seats on the Boeing 777 are SOOOOO much better than on any Airbus. The only dislike we had was United's new system for watching movies, etc.....unless you have an APP and a tablet or I-phone you're out of luck watching a movie or watching the progress of the flight, etc. Not a good change for older customers."
Dec 2019,30,$330 more for a seat that was standard a few years ago.,"It is the only flight going from America to Berlin, Germany direct. All other flights on any airline are not direct flights.  United calls 4 inches more legroom Economy Plus for $330 extra. A few years ago, that was a regular economy seat.  Food and drinks are the same as in Economy.  The 767 was one of the older planes."
Dec 2019,50,Polaris business class a pleasant surprise,"United has really upped its game on long haul business class. Comfortable seats, good entertainment options and friendly flight attendants (although not quite as solicitous as those we had on ANA on way over to Japan."
Dec 2019,20,Don't bother to upgrade to premium,"Flight from Newark to Paris for our honeymoon - we upgraded to Premium Economy on United and it was a waste of money and overall an uncomfortable flight. Barely any service for drinks that were complementary because they only cared about the business class patrons and the flight attendants were very rude. My husband had a busted TV and nothing to do about it. It was also a really loud flight because there was no separation between the two other sections. And they ran out of ""premium"" food selection so we had the economy selection anyways. I would have saved a lot of money and just upgraded to comfort. I don't think I would ever waste my money on that type of fare again or fly United in general."
Dec 2019,10,United Dies Not Care,The plane was an hour late getting to San Francisco. Then we sat on the plane for 90 minutes waiting for the right first class food to arrive. No food or even pretzels or cookies was ever provided to the non First class passengers during the flight. We arrived in DC area well after 2:15 AM. The last passengers leaving the airport - No apologies or any sort of attempt to make up for delay and lack of courtesy regarding food.
Dec 2019,50,Good service,"There is a TV screen in front of every seat, so it seems that the flight time was much shorter. The wheelchair service was prompt & excellent, especially the gentleman pushed our wheelchair at Boston Logan Airport. He helped us all the way from outside the plane, to luggage claims and out of the door to the car side."
Dec 2019,40,United was great,The return flight from our cruise across the Atlantic from Barcelona was ok considering. We had over 12 hours to wait so we took a ride up Sugar Loaf. Then at airport we waited. After checking in at 5:35 pm for a 9:55 flight we thought we’d have time to shop but a horrible nearly 3 hour wait in line at passport control saw us standing on a hard floor without explanation. They only had 1 gate open at first. Some passengers got angry. A second gate opened. Wowee. There were 5 other long distance flights leaving that evening.  But our trip on United was good. We prefer Asian airlines and past experience for10 plus hours on United was not good. But the meal was acceptable. Seats had leg room. After standing on a hard floor for so long we were hurting. Not United’s fault. A concern was our connection time in IAH but we made it. In transit through US to Canada is not the easiest and we have Nexus but our daughter who was with us didn’t. Recommend u get Nexus as even IAH US passport control was a long miserable line without Nexus.  I’d consider United for international travel to S America again - and although United still have elderly staff on board they were polite and efficient. The flights were on time
Dec 2019,30,Stuck at Chicago airport,"Through no fault of the airline, my flight from New York was delayed by 6 hours. This was due to weather systems in the southeast and south so inbound flights were delayed. I missed by connection in Chicago by 2 hours. If I had not bought a first class ticket, I would have been in a line stretching through the concourse to rebook. First class passengers get their own separate line so I was able to get rebooked, but not until 3 pm the following afternoon. The United lounge closed at 10 pm and it was well past that time so I was forced to ""sleep"" in a plastic chair. When the lounge opened the next morning I had to pay $55 to get in, even though I had bought a first class ticket. I did so because it was quiet, had food, and comfortable chairs. The lady at the check in acted like I was contaminating the space and had me step aside so she could check in the ""important"" people. Having flown first class on Alaska in the past, I knew this was poor customer service. Also, flying first class on Alaska allows entry into the Alaska lounge with no extra charge. The delay was not the fault of the airline, but the customer service in the Chicago United lounge was abysmal. Plus, only house wines are free of charge. Others are an extra charge; even though it cost $55 to enter."
Dec 2019,50,Excellent flight and staff,"Perfect flight from Chicago to Toronto. As a seasoned traveler, I have flown with several different carriers and United continues to be one of my favourite. Delays can (and do) happen with every airline, but as far as customer service, United has always come through for me with flying colours. The key (with any customer service member, no matter the issue or company) is to be kind and not attack the person trying to help you. A little kindness will ensure a good experience. This particular flight was on time & had no issues, other than being about 15 minutes early to arrive in YYZ. Flight attendants were courteous. The selection of in flight snacks was nice (you can choose between 3 different things...pretzels, stroopwaffles, or Biscoff cookies). Everyone I interacted with was top notch. The in flight entertainment was easy to use on my iPad & was free as well."
Dec 2019,50,Fantastic,Very clean very good flight.Big seat roomy.Staff very friendly. They serv you plenty food and drink what ever you require.i like this flight I definitely recommend all people.
Dec 2019,40,Extra leg room??,"We did not book this flight, but the tour company did. They got us seats by the emergency door that gave us unlimited leg room. So we were looking forward to that on a long flight. Turns out it was near the rest room and there was a nearly constant line that spilled over onto our corner of the plane. Was stepped on once by a person waiting. All other aspects, including staff, were fine. One staff member even stepped in to remind those in the bathroom line to not congregate. I share this experience only to warm those who might be tempted to pay extra for the seats by the emerg exits that there can be a down side."
Dec 2019,40,On time flight,The flight was on time. The crew were professional and friendly. It was a smooth flight. My seat was comfortable and had enough space to accommodate me. The legroom was spacious.
Dec 2019,10,"This Can't Be Real, Is It?","After a ridiculously bad experience on United this past Spring, I decided to give them one more chance to redeem themselves, but alas United is the worst airline that ever flew. I flew Polaris class on their new 787-10 Dreamliner, and it should be renamed NIGHTMAREliner. Sure the plane is beautiful, but the Polaris cubicles are a claustrophobic nightmare.  The worst thing about flying United, however, is the interaction with the employees, whether they be ground personnel, flight non-attendants, or customer dis-service. I had hoped that the United mentality would rub off on the Continental employees after the merger, but it went in the other direction. The airline is now staffed entirely by bitter union low-lifes who treat customers like garbage. Coincidentally, garbage was what I found in the seat area of the new 787 Polaris cubicle. I guess cleaning the cabin is something that is too much to expect.  The bottom line is that this airline needs go go out of business. I will NEVER fly on United again, and I urge everyone to avoid this airline like the plague (which is something I'm sure exists in the galleys). Send United a message by not spending your money with it. Fly another airline, always."
Dec 2019,50,"Staff extremely helpful, flight good.","Had to have a wheelchair because United’s terminal is so large, I couldn’t possibly walk it. The transporters were extremely nice and I didn’t have to wait in long lines. However, my partner forgot that he had his Swiss Army knife on him. Well they confiscated it. They did not offer to save it for him or even let him mail it back to himself. He was quite upset by that since he’s had it for 20 years. There should be some way you can get these items when you return. The flight was full, relatively smooth, and on time. No complaints."
Dec 2019,30,"Nice plane, indifferent service","I hate flying these days primarily for the hassle at the airports and the irritation I feel to pay for all the things that once were free, like checking my bag. United did not require that I pay to check my bag. ( By contrast, American charged us to check on our return flight.) Our plane was new, spotlessly clean, and very comfortable. We paid for economy plus. We had plenty of leg room and comfortable, spacious seats. I could have gone all the way to Europe comfortably. In other words, economy plus was not cattle car time. I was pleasantly surprised and advise flyers to shell out the extra fee tor it. On the negative, the flight crew seemed tired and irritable, doing no more than the minimum expected of them. I don’t think I saw a smile, not even when I thanked the mad I left the flight. But overall, a nice flying experience, words from one who didn’t think she would ever say that again.."
Dec 2019,40,Very Competent but not Over the Top,"Flight on time, good cockpit communications, clean aircraft, great ground staff, and competent but not over the top flight attendants. The wines were quite good but the food mediocre, especially compared with Alaska Air.    Also I hate the 737s for these 5 hour flights. The Airbuses Hawaiian and American use are far superior. But 737s seem to be the world we live in. Even the first class lavatories are tight. And cabin width is narrow. Main Cabin must be horrendous.    One thing I don’t like about these Hawai’i flights is that the cabin crews make a one day turn so they are pretty tired on the return flight. This is different from Alaska where attendants overnight and are perky on the return. Similarly, catering is all done in SFO for the return flight so is not fresh and due to galley size, choices are limited. Alaska and Hawaiian have local catering."
Dec 2019,50,First time on the Dreamliner,Great experience.  Boarding was swift. Flight attendants helped where needed.  The plane was extremely comfortable. One of the Dreamliner fleet. Temperature control and humidity were comfortable. Changing the dimness of the windows was something new and wonderful.
Dec 2019,10,6 hours waiting,"We were o board, buckled in when they took everyone off the plane. A problem with the window on the flight deck. Around 7 am. We sat waiting until around 1 pm. They couldn't get another plane for us. Around 1 pm they brought back the same plane, fixed.  Not a very nice plane. It's Dec 9th and they still had the Nov magazine..entertainment didn't work too well."
Dec 2019,30,Can I fly a different airline next time?,"Flew the overseas and return flights on United. The domestic legs on partner airlines. On my flight the business class cabin was worn and somewhat shabby. The flight attendants did a good job but bit the greatest I have experienced. The Domestic flights were on Lufthanza who's idea of business class is no one in the middle seat. That's all! Egypt Air was somewhat better although is was a short flight from Amman to Cairo. Air Sinai, from Cairo to Tel Aviv, the only direct flight, which can not be booked online but must be booked through Egypt Air as a separate point to point flight was like riding in a bus with chickens on top and goats in the aisle.    The worst thing about United was baggage handling. My large, hard sided suitcase was absolutely DESTROYED! Yes, it was a 70 lb bag, which is allowed in business class, and it was marked heavy. When I finally got it, three days late, the wheels were gone, the zipper was ripped open and the hard shell was broken in several places. It looked like it had been unloaded by dropping from the plane to the tarmac, and then having the plane run over it. Some of my contents were lost. There was no apparent effort by the airline to secure the contents by wrapping or taping the suitcase. They eventually paid for the bag but not the lost contents."
Dec 2019,50,Attention to Detail,"Always a satisfying flight when flying United anywhere in the country.  Team members are always there with the utmost attention to all passengers,and their needs...A+ to the United Airlines Staff."
Dec 2019,30,United Airlines,"Usual cramped seating. We left a little late but the pilot made up time. ""Food"" usual boxes of snacks exceedingly expensive. Better to buy food before boarding. There was a Hudson News opposite our gate and they had nice healthy snacks for purchase. Staff on the plane were polite and efficient."
Dec 2019,30,U A Flight,"I flew to and from HKG recently on United. I paid extra $34 for seat up grade, didnt use it , the plane was half full, had a row of seats to myself. The food is not as good as on other airlines, it was like a snack."
Dec 2019,50,Pleased with United,"United does a good job overall. Using Newark which is a major hub for them allows us to fly to so many places with direct flights and options on times. Terminal C is in great shape and parking is very convenient. Economy plus seating is critical for me at 6' 2"" and as a gold member I always get it."
Dec 2019,30,United delivered the flight I needed!,"I chose UAL because I prefer direct flights and UAL had what I wanted. I think the quality of service has dropped from what it use to be 20 yrs ago and it is ridiculous to have to pay extra for your luggage. Am I going to spend 2 weeks in Japan and carry all my needs in a carry-on?? Add the price to my ticket, don't tack such a ridiculous fee on the end!! Southwest has no added fees for luggage, in fact, they allow 2 free bags! I paid extra for leg room."
Dec 2019,50,Looooooooooong,"There is nothing United can do about the distance. It is a really long flight (18 hours non stop). They tried to make it better with a huge amount of movies and that is a plus. We upgraded to economy plus (for $800+ roundtrip) and not sure how much I enjoyed those extra inches. It's all psychological! They serve three meals (lunch/snack/breakfast) and if I have to rate it I will give it a 2 (yes, from 1 to 10 being 10 the highest). Not that I expect a Michelin meal but at least not frozen! Disgusting. Bring your own headphones, a good pillow, a blanket (why they insist with those paper light ones!?) and just think that the whole thing is about destination, not how you get there! Have fun!"
Dec 2019,50,cruise,flight from fort Lauderdale to Chicago was great!!! but the connecting flight to Dayton was delayed three times do to crew problems.. NOT GOOD!!! so never ever fly the Sunday after Thanksgiving!!!..but would still fly United again....
Dec 2019,30,Almost Perfect!,"Since they changed the First Class seating arrangement, it is not worth it and the food is not up to what I consider First Class> Other airlines such as Delta and American have the same deals on pricing but better seats and meals."
Dec 2019,40,flight from Mexico to Washington,We were lucky nobody was sitting in the middle seat between us but not so lucky when the passengers in the exit row in front of us reclined their seats for the entire flight.    Bathrooms in coach section are increasingly way too small and keep getting smaller and more uncomfortable.
Dec 2019,30,SFO to SAF via ABQ with Uber,"This is not so much about the flight itself but about problem solving. Our planned SFO-SAF via DEN was delayed beyond a time that worked for us. With some prodding, the agent in SFO put me and my wife on a direct flight to ABQ arriving approximately three hours before our original DEN-SAF was scheduled. But our car was parked at SAF. We investigated the cost of the shuttle from ABQ to Santa Fe downtown: 2X$37.95. Which would still leave us needing a ride to the airport. An Uber from ABQ to SAF was approximately $60 total. Problem solved. We arrived at SAF two hours before our originally scheduled flight and more than five hours before the later flight necessitated by the weather delays."
Dec 2019,20,Washington flight 3 1/2 hours delay,"Once we were at the flight gate, we were told they don't have the crew.  Then we were told they will arrive late.  We ended up with more than 3 hours delay in an uncomfortable corridor Z gates!"
Dec 2019,50,Newark airport is bad!,"At Newark airport I had to wait in 3 different lines to check my bag! Not so in Raleigh. TSA took an hour, no seating to put on shoes."
Dec 2019,30,"Skies are still friendly, but cramped","This was an average flight, but crowded for a red-eye. Seating was cramped, but level hospitality was good and the flight came in on time, despite delayed takeoff."
Dec 2019,30,I got what I expected - delays.,There are NO direct flights from Dayton to San Antonio so I had to make a stop and chose Washington DC (Dulles). That meant a smaller 50-seater from Dayton to DC. We left late by close to an hour on the way out to DC and same for the way home FROM DC back to Dayton. Just schedule your layover accordingly because you WILL be delayed.
Dec 2019,50,Flawless flight.,"It has been a long time since we traveled with United. What a pleasant surprise. Excellent flight, kind and efficient flight attendants, fully reclining chair, turning into a comfortable bed. I only have compliments. Well done."
Dec 2019,50,For a change it was a breeze,Boarded on time  Enough space for most passengers to sit comfortably.  Food was ok. Service wasn't great. A lot could be improved  Too much plastic offered
Dec 2019,40,Very comfortable,"First time flying Premium Economy (PE). A/C was a 787 Dreamliner  PE is a separate cabin situated between Business and Economy, consisting of only 3 rows in a 2-3-2 config. Seat was comfortably larger than standard Economy, with much larger recline than Econ, plus a leg and foot rest. OBE has a large screen and headphones are included, allegedly noise-cancelling. but not nearly as effective as my Bose headphones. Video selections were fairly broad w/ both movie & TV programs. I typically prefer audio and in this I was a bit disappointed. A number of genres are available, but within each was only a pre-selected collection. No option to select a particular group or album that I saw.  The lavatory is the largest I've ever seen in all my years of flying in all classes and airlines.  The electronically-controlled windows, when individual control is enabled are great. I was seated at a window on the left side, facing the sun. When fully darkened, the sun was shaded so much it looked like viewing the moon at night. Very cool.  Down sides: I won't go into detail, but boarding at FRA was chaotic. Gate announcements were curt, garbled and very hard to hear. This is partly due to the facility, but United could and should take measures to improve this.  I have lounge access, so hung there until boarding time, but it looked like there was little gate area seating available.  On board service was OK, but just. Food service was better than std economy, but didn't feel particularly special."
Dec 2019,50,"Clean, friendly and knit e",Flight attendants were very nice. The plane was clean. Greeted everyone as they boarded. Pilots were interactive with the passengers.
Dec 2019,40,A bad day made better,"Strong winds had cancelled all flights into Chicago which would have caused us to miss our connecting flight to NYC. It was a hectic morning with lots of frustrated people but attendant quickly re-booked us flights with Air Canada and we were able to still make it to NYC on time.  Great help and good work dealing with a difficult, stressful situation."
Dec 2019,40,Work Trip,"A trip I made to a conference in Lima, the flight was really nice. The flight attendants were nice and helpful providing a good service and the flight entertainment held a high class, the food on the flight was not the best but it was okay. Check in was smooth as always."
Dec 2019,40,Return trip from Maui on United,"Love their new flights from Hawaii to Denver to KC. If I can't get a direct flight to KC, this is the best next option. The only issue is having to fly to Honolulu through partner Hawaiian Airlines. For some reason, the confirmation code from United couldn't be used to check me in online with Hawaiian since Hawaiian can't use letters, only numbers, so I had to call in and get checked in with Hawaiian. They did offer me an earlier flight at the airport, so was able to get to Honolulu an hour earlier. The flight from Honolulu to Denver was perfect and a place on seat in front to place your tablet or phone to watch movies and a great selection of entertainment through their United app. The gate from Denver to KC was at the very end of the airport and took forever to get to, but I had time and it was a smaller, regional plane and had to check my bag for free. Overall, great airline and experience, just need to get their confirmation numbers sorted out with Hawaiian to check in online."
Dec 2019,10,Travel Nightmare!,"I had myself the nightmare in airline tales! Started on Thursday morning in Winnipeg, planning to arrive in Asheville in early evening. Flight was delayed due to snow in Chicago; flight was delayed due to equipment problems; flight was cancelled. They put us in a hotel and I started back on Friday morning, but now I was supposed to fly from Winnipeg to Montreal to Dulles International to Asheville. The landing was aborted in Montreal and we were diverted to Toronto. There I discovered that my bag was lost, but I could catch a flight to Dulles. Then Passport Control wouldn't let me board the plane because my bags were lost (like I had any control over that!). Some extra effort by Air Canada finally got me on that flight, just before it took off. I would have missed the connection in Dulles, but that flight was delayed because of equipment problems. My favorite: I asked the United representative if she thought our flight to Asheville would be cancelled since it was so late. Oh no, she said, we need that aircraft in Asheville tomorrow morning. Good to know they were interested in getting us safely to Asheville! After landing it was another hour to re-report my lost bag and then an hour to drive home. My bag arrived two days later. I've flown extensively through the years, but my plans for 2020 only include car travel!"
Dec 2019,50,Excelente airline,One of the best international flys. Great food and great customer service. Very clean and always in the schedule
Dec 2019,50,Flight crew was excellent,"We were coming home from 3 weeks in Florida. We flew to Fort Lauderdale on United and was a nice flights (Phx to Houston then to Fort Lauderdale) We Uberd to South Beach then up to Datona Beach then over to Orlando. We flew out on United Economy. We have United Club Card so no baggage charge to fly the cheapest economy. On our way home, after using United club in Houston we boarded flight to Phoenix. United had placed us in upgraded seats right behind first class and behind the restroom. Great leg space. We were setting there when a very nice and attractive stewardess leaned over from the isle and wished me a happy birthday. I was taken away that she knew it was my birthday! Not only was I taken away by her wishes I felt I had to explain to my wife I didn't know her! I thanked her and asked how she knew. She had an app from United that sent her a notice a passenger had a birthday that day. Then each member of the flight crew came up during the flight and offered there wishes for a happy birthday. The head stewardesses came up and asked me what type of drink would I like and they gave me one. How nice every person on that flight were and I noticed they were that friendly with every one on that flight. Kudo's to United for a super crew that made flying special for me and my wife. As I was walking off the plane the pilot was at the door into the flight deck and he offered me his wishes too. Wow this is why we fly United. Not always this friendly but wish they were all like this."
Dec 2019,50,Unexpected,"Very pleased. We fly this route several times a year and were pleasantly surprised that not only did the plane leave on time, it arrived early."
Dec 2019,40,Efficient and on-time flight despite potential storms,"The forecast for the NJ area was for potentially heavy snow, and we arrived early at the airport to be prepared. The airport was jammed with post-Thanksgiving travelers. Our flight was booked full and they were soliciting travelers who might give up their seats for future flights. Boarding started early and was completed in time for an on-time departure, and service was pleasant and efficient, and we were rewarded with an early arrival at O'Hare. The only glitch was that some of our bags arrived on the neighboring carousel without notice, but that was a very small price to pay for the excellent service."
Dec 2019,40,Better than most,"The flight was long and tiring, but the aircraft and crew were as good as any I've experienced in the last few years. The pilots did make too many announcements, which eventually got irritating, but that is a minor quibble."
Dec 2019,30,"Short delay getting out, long delay coming home - clear weather both ways","This is a short flight on a small regional jet. The outbound flight was delayed briefly due to an earlier delay in getting the equipment into Denver. The flight home was delayed by several hours. The incoming crew at Durango thought the front tire was flat so United called for a mechanic to check it out. Apparently the only mechanic was nowhere near Durango because it took more than two hours for him to show up and check the air in the tire. His verdict: The tire was fine and did not need air. We had no issue with the tire being checked out, of course, but the length of time to get a mechanic to the airport to do that was ridiculous."
Dec 2019,50,extraordinary help,"For 4 legs to our journey both going and coming back, we had 3 different planes. I choose to speak about the aforementioned leg. This large plane had a great set up. We were in first class. The first that happened as we were settling in was my husband got his ear bud caught in the seat. While trying to get it out his ring slipped off his finger and fell down into the seat. It took 2 mechanics to take the seat apart and a delay of 30 min. to finally found the ring. We were so embarrassed but it enabled 5 late comers to catch the flight and all time was made up in flight. Everyone clapped, everyone was concerned and very gracious. The lower score for cleanliness was due to all the stuff that was between and under the seat. Even the stewards and mechanics were appalled."
Dec 2019,20,Unimpressed,"I will never fly with United again, substandard in almost every respect. I was most disappointed by the state of the aircraft, the comfort, the service on board etc"
Dec 2019,40,Good flight experience,"The flight was comfortable in Economy Plus and a few minutes early in getting in. Otherwise, normal and unremarkable."
Dec 2019,30,First on time flight all year!,"I have had bad luck all year on United. I travel often for business and 2x a year for vacation. Newark, NJ (EWR) is the United hub so most direct flights are out of EWR.  two of my flights were cancelled all together this year within 3 months.    This trip was delayed but yet we arrived on time. United has been stretching out air time for awhile now to include taxi at gate etc.    Staff were wonderful; however my biggest issues with United are 1) cleanliness and 2)food and wine quality. The planes are often not disinfected between flights because everything is rushed. In business class the wines are not even names that are well known, and they rarely provide meals anymore unless you luck out on an international flight plane like a Polaris. Upgraded 159.00 to be served potato chips. The meals you do get often do not consider vegetarian , gluten or dairy issues either.    Finally the wifi to watch movies etc. is not good ever. I always get stuck on planes without in flight entertainment. When traveling alone it is not so bad but when the whole family goes and you all need a device, pay for for service etc. it adds up and often is so slow the movies freeze constantly."
Dec 2019,20,Oldest Cross Country Plane,"This had to be the oldest 737 in United’s fleet. This plane must have been from the original line of planes coming off the assembly line in Seattle. Everything was jiggly and creaky. The only upgrade it seemed United had time for was to push the rows of seats closer together. Just another example of airlines seeing how poorly they can treat their paying customers. This flight sparked another letter of complaint to the FAA: the only solution is mandatory federal standards for seat width, pitch, and comfort. We have to be the change cause airlines do not care as long as they make money. We need to MAKE them care."
Dec 2019,30,Not to dog friendly,"As far as my wife and I we were treated very well until the Stewardess ask me to zip up the dog carrier and put the dog under the seat. First of all the seats are way too small to get a carrier under it. So I put it on the floor between my feet. The dog later on began to cry so I put the carrier on my lap and unzipped it. The dog was hot and over heated, I gave him water. The Stewardess came by again tell me to put him under the seat. I told her the problem but she didn’t care. Now I paid $125 for the dog it wasn’t free, he cost more than my fare and didn’t get a seat, and I wasn’t allowed to even have him while in his crate be on my lap. Not very pet friendly. By the time our 2 1/2 hour flight was over the dog was a basket case."
Dec 2019,50,Traveling In-State,"Traveled to McAllen to attend the South Texas Historical Association conference in Alamo, TX. Flight between College Station and Houston was as usual - short, tight seats. Better plane from Houston to McAllen - on time, more leg and seat room."
Dec 2019,50,Flight from Dulles to Rome was great,"This was an overnight flight from Dulles to Rome leaving at 5:20 PM and getting in Rome at 8:00 AM. The attendants were great and the accommodations as expected. Generally, I don't handle overnight flights or flights this long well, but was actually able to get a little sleep making the time zone transition go well."
Dec 2019,50,On time and luggage arrived quickly.,"On time flight, edible food with decent wine and luggage arrived in a timely manner.  I won't lie and say the seats were the most comfortable but, the entertainment system worked, the temperature was comfortable and the crew friendly. Decent legroom because we paid for exit row seats."
Dec 2019,10,Would refrain from flying United ever again,"Extremely cramped seats. Poor service. I have flown numerous times with other airlines such as Air Canada, Air France, British Airways, and Ailitalia to Europe and Asia... all have been fantastic. United seems to be a budget airline with no customer service and the seats are so tight with little to no leg room. Inflight service was little to non-existent. Would never fly with United again."
Dec 2019,10,Delayed,"We arrived at 1 pm for a 3 pm flight. It was delayed several times, we never received any notice on our phones or online. Delayed again on tarmac, took off a little before 7 pm. Airport was miserable, cold and WiFi so slow it kept glitching. Bad experience"
Dec 2019,30,Key West,The Flight was good other then we had a connecting flight and it was a small company so coming home we had to pay for luggage even though we booked through United Airlines.
Dec 2019,50,surpised by great flight,"Surprisingly, this flight was on time, very smooth, and pleasant. Boarding was simple, enough overhead space."
Dec 2019,50,On time arrivals,"Excellent service.! United has the best Lounge,amazing food,and drinks.! Very personable staff.! Flight was on time and was very comfortable.! Flight attendants very professional and courteous.!"
Dec 2019,10,Never book on Embraer aircraft,"I will never again book a flight on an Embraer aircraft. Despite being told in advance that carry on luggage was permitted, we were forced to gate check our bags. Then upon arrival in Madison, we were forced to stand in a hot, stuffy jetway to wait to retrieve our gate-checked luggage. The final insult was when an item inside my gate-checked bag was destroyed and United denied adequate compensation for my loss. Never again!"
Dec 2019,40,Business trip,"Really enjoy flying the Dreamliner from Denver to Heathrow. Travelling in Premium Economy was comfortable, lots more legroom than standard Economy. The food was very good, the cabin crew were very friendly."
Dec 2019,10,"UNITED Was My Lifelong Favorite, Now They’re NEXT TO LAST!!!!","On this and every flight I have taken on UNITED over the last several years, they changed my seats - sometimes twice - to much worse and downgraded seats the day before the flight with no recourse except going to the airport early on praying for a compassionate, helpful gate agent. Additionally, they have canceled flights, and automatically rebooked much worse flight itineraries and seats, and disregarded the Economy Plus upgrades I had purchased, as well as my in-cabin pet reservations, all at considerable lost time and aggravation to me. United cares only about profit now, no longer about customer service or satisfaction. They operate solely in damage control mode and seek to do what is most expedient and cost-effective for themselves, customers be damned. And they’re passing along all their canceled flight costs to us in the way of increased ticket prices. Customers lose all the way around. Corporate America at its finest. Boycotting is our only voice and leverage because they don’t care about one more customer complaint.    They recently outsourced their customer service call center to the Filippines and those agents are the worst I’ve ever experienced. They are unskilled at service, read a script, supposedly have no authority to satisfactorily resolve problems and don’t seem to care at all. One agent on Saturday lied about the new seats she assigned me when I called to complain and hung up on me. When I didn’t receive an email update I checked my itinerary online and found she had put me in economy middle seats in the back, rather than Economy Plus window seats over the wing as I had and paid a significant upgrade for prior to the changes, and as she said she had rebooked for me.    This is one example of many horrific experiences with United that have cost me hours and even days - for example, by far the worst was this past weekend as a result of mechanical failures, canceled flights, forced overnight stays, missing pet reservations, and harassment, incompetence and disregard by ticketing and gate agents. In fact, they were being so arbitrary and bullying that when I didn’t cave to their unreasonable demands regarding their mistake, the airport police were brought in to mediate.    I’m sorry to say that in addition to AMERICAN, UNITED is now on my NEVER AGAIN list."
Dec 2019,20,Houston to Maui,"bad choice on my part by choosing wide-body flight to Honolulu first. the 30+ minutes transfers,via Hawaii Airline, to Maui and back were terrible. United changed my transit departure time one hour earlier without letting me know so we had to scramble from Hawaii Airline terminal to United terminal; almost missed our flight.  We also lost our free checked baggage, preferred boarding, even our TSA pre-check status on our return trip, simply because we boarded Hawaii Airline first.  Should have booked two 737 United flights (IAH to LAX, LAX to OGG); it would have saved more money and lots of headaches."
Dec 2019,40,Good business class flight,"Well, since I flew business class, how bad could it be, right? The service is actually good, but the food is just average. On such a long flight, it is so nice to be able to stretch out an actually fall asleep."
Dec 2019,20,Not Good!,"My flight from Richmond to Newark got cancelled two hours before take off due to weather. Over an hour on the phone, finally got booked for the next morning. Arrived at the airport only to be told I did not have a seat. I was put on standby. Fortunately, I got on and was given the last seat way in the back and very cramped. It really makes me not want to fly anymore! I had to rearrange for my pet sitter and my pickup at the airport. The train is looking good."
Dec 2019,40,Amazing Loyalty Plan and experiences Pilots,The new service (Premium Plus) offered all the commodities for long trips and superior service in Food and crew attention. Flights on time and you barely will feel the turbulence like happened to me so many times in Avianca.
Dec 2019,50,Best Flight,"I was not looking forward to a fourteen hour flight, until I was shown to my seat. In addition to the fully reclining ""pod"" seat, United also provided a small case loaded with amenities (lotion, lip balm, eye mask, socks, and slippers) Pajamas and headphone were also available. Food was delicious and service quiet and unobtrusive. One of the best flights overseas."
Dec 2019,10,Horrible experience,The flight was supposed to start at 5.45. The boarding was complete by 5.40 PM. Then suddenly pilot said that there is some maintenance to be done.    They made us sit for 2 hours giving one or the other excuse. After 2 hour 30 mins they said that some maintenance person needs to board the flight.    Then suddenly 3 passenger boarded the flight and Pilot announce that maintenance was complete :(    This is hilarious.
Dec 2019,50,A great smooth flight into beautiful Everett.,We left Denver in the evening and it was a little bumpy after take off as usual but at altitude it was smooth the rest of the way. Wonderful service and comfortable seats for economy. It's way too expensive to upgrade. Landing in the new Everett airport and arriving at the nice terminal is wonderful. 10 minutes from landing to our car. WOW.
Dec 2019,10,United Premier,"The worst check-in, baggage, and customer service I have ever been a part of. I will never fly United again...and I will NEVER fly Business/First class because the cost is NOT worth it at all. Horrible horrible horrible!"
Dec 2019,10,Take another airline,"horrible...seats are so tiny, walking to the bathroom on the aisle is a joke...no tv service and flight was delayed ..and to top it off had plane had mechanically failure and flew as the pilot stated “downgraded” gps system in other words the main gps failed and we went with whatever else system they had..united has downgraded their planes so much and keep increasing their prices.."
Dec 2019,40,United Explorer Card Lets Me Check a Bag For Free,"The flight left early so we got into LAX early. United has their own Immigration and Customs facility. Immigration took forever, and why do I have to fill out paperwork on the plane which is completely ignored because I also have to enter the same data into a machine that gives me a godawful photo of myself. Customs was easy. Bag was there, of course, because of the super long wait in immigration. Fly Away bus pick up location was right outside the exit door for terminal 7. Yippee."
Dec 2019,10,Late from Harrisburg PA to Dulles. No flight available to St.Thomas for 4 days.no Compensation.,"Not our fault the flight was delayed in Harrisburg!  We were told that the plane needed to be diced and there was no one to do it.  In Dulles we were told it was the fault of the ground crew.  There was no no compensation, no meals, no hotels and no flight available from Sat. until the following Tuesday!  Finally a flight through San Juan."
Dec 2019,30,"Houston-Frankfurt, Shanghai-San Francisco-Houston",Long. Overnight to Frankfurt. Shanghai-San Francisco-Houston was done on 9/11 and surprisingly full flight.
Dec 2019,20,A cold ride!,"Other than being really cold and providing only very thin blankets to try to wrap up in it was OK, but even the stewards said it was ""freezing"", but it didn't crash! But it was definitely not KLM!"
Dec 2019,50,great connections,"had a great flight, but......Denver as a connector is the worst airport too many people too few places to eat and no where to sit."
Dec 2019,30,Very good connection,"United has excellent connection time to Honolulu however their service is less than average.  No in-flight entertainment, you have to use your own device and download the UNITED app before your flight."
Dec 2019,40,United flight to Omaha.,"My wife and I booked a Thanksgiving flight to Omaha to spend time with family who live there. The flight left on time and arrived a little early. The flight was easy and quick. The crew service was friendly and welcoming. the return flight was also 15 minutes ahead of time, and again service and flight pleasant. No complaints at all. Good job crew."
Dec 2019,50,Great Flight On United Express Jet,This was an excellent flight both ways. Captains let you up to date and crews were exceptional. I would highly recommend United! Great job guys!
Dec 2019,50,No issues,We had no issues with these flights. They were on time. the staff was pleasant and there were sufficient restrooms...what more can you ask for?
Dec 2019,30,"12 hour Pacific Island hopper, business class, no food!!","I flew Guam to Truuk to Pohnpei to Kosrae Island to Kwajalein Atoll to Majuro Atoll. And 10 days later, did the same in reverse. 12 hours each way but none of the flight legs long enough for cabin crew to serve a meal - or even snacks! But views just out of this world."
Dec 2019,30,1ST CLASS IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE!,"When will selfish, vapid 1st time parents learn that not everyone wants to listen to their babies cry for the entire flight? Sometimes, a gentle ""shhhh"" to their child will do wonders! Best that they fly Economy Class where they belong!    Although reminded NOT to use the 1st Class Bathroom by United ""Staff...Enconomy Class Passengers barged through our 1st Class Cabin to use our facilities...leaving their 2nd Class (classless!) Mess in their wake!"
Dec 2019,20,mediocre experience for full fare first class,Insufficient qualtity and selection of mediocre meal choices. Adequate but standoffish crew. Not very comfortable for first class seating on new (727-900) aircraft. No infligfht entertainment except on United app.
Dec 2019,20,Bare Bones Travel,"I have been flying all of my adult life. As a sales manager in the 70s and 80s I averaged more than 100 flights a year all over the US. Back then flying was, if not exactly fun, an easy, laid-back experience. Fast forward to 2019. I am retired but still fly regularly and the comparison is bleak. A gigantic step backwards. My flight from LAX to BOS began with an hour wasted by the ritual humiliation of TSA inspection (which has been proven to do absolutely nothing to increase our safety.) Once on board, I discovered there were no video screens. In-flight entertainment was possible only on the screen of a personal device with a United app that had to be downloaded beforehand. The extra legroom I paid for was adequate, but the leather seat was hard and uncomfortable. Cabin service was efficient, but no meal was served and only soft drinks and water were 'free'. If this is progress, you can keep it."
Dec 2019,20,Expensive and grubby.,I used to like United but it seems they have gone down hill. The planes we flew in were from the 70s and very Grubby. The service was O.K. The food horrible and sometimes there wasn't any. Gave me the Rhapsody Blues. Not flying them again!
Dec 2019,30,Basic Economy Fare,United started something new Basic Economy Fare. You have to pay extra to get a window or aisle. You don’t get regular miles credit. Can’t use your gold benefit to update.
Dec 2019,50,2 thumbs up,"We would definitely recommend United Airlines! Lots of leg room, served a complimentary drink and snack, even on this short of a flight.  Attendants were very friendly and polite, and the pilot kept us updated with flight information"
Dec 2019,40,Flight was on time and on-board service was entirely satisfactory,"Flight was on time, luggage arrived on time, and on-board service was entirely satisfactory. My one comment is that American cabin staff tend to speak rapidly (one reason why I prefer British or European airlines, as their staff enunciate more clearly)."
Dec 2019,40,Great flight experience,"United airlines has a great staff, on the ground and in the air. Friendly, courteous, and looking to make your experience with United a memorable one. The seating was comfortable and plenty of room."
Dec 2019,50,Excellent flight,Everything was dealt with in an excellent manner by the airline and all staff. Did not experience any problem at all and arrival early in Houston.
Dec 2019,50,Great experience,"Was a great flight, on time and with great service. Left early in morning and flew through Houston Texas. Both legs of the trip were on time and got in a few minutes early"
Dec 2019,20,delayed flight made for a very long day,"final leg delayed. Information regarding actual flight was not very encouraging. Boarding was chaotic, lots of tired, cranky people."
Dec 2019,30,The flight itself was very good. The flight attendants were excellent.,The flight was good. The flight attendants were excellent at making sure you had whatever you needed. My only issue is they charged for lunch which other airlines didn't. Plus when you had to connect to another flight there was not enough time to stop and grab a lunch to take on the plane. Landing and getting to your connecting flight is very tight.
Dec 2019,10,United Airlines lost my suitcase(s)Sept.27th-no reimbursement yet!,"United Airlines lost my suitcase on Sept. 27, 2019. I flew from MCO to SFO to HNL. I was on a business trip. They haven't reimbursed me for my expenses(had to go out & buy clothes, pjs, toothpaste etc. They haven't reimbursed me for the contents of my lost luggage either. I've sent them the claim form with a listing of everything. I've emailed them, I've called but to no avail. They said they're still working on it. Good grief. The emails I get from them are automated. I'm a million miler plus and this is the way they treat me. Unbelievable! They also tried to charge me again for my cancelled flight from Haneda, Japan to SFO to MCO. It was my return flight for the same leg for my business trip. They hadn't notified me of the cancelled trip either by email or phone call.  I have a business trip scheduled next year for England, France and Switzerland. I don't know if I'll book with United since this matter hasn't been taken care of."
Dec 2019,40,Smooth sailing (?),Took the 6:45pm flight. Uneventful which is always good. Plane loaded smoothly but we ended up in a queue for the runway which meant our take-off was behind schedule. Nevertheless we arrived approx 15 mins late. Food was... well airline food. Flight full. Overall things were just as expected.
Dec 2019,40,"The flight was very good. Only they have to serve food on long flights even in the same country-usa.from Honolulu to N,y","We flew connection to Vancoover ,and back from Honolulu to N,y and then to Tel_Aviv.All flights were night flights which was very good."
Dec 2019,40,Come fly with me,"First time travelling with UA airlines. On the way out the plane was a little dated, but ample room in Economy if your not too tall. We were at the back of the plane in row  43, they call you to board in 4 groups with one entrance at the front of the plane only.    Group 4 were last, so we had to  Board an already full plane with not much room left for our hand luggage but staff helped moved bags around to accommodate. Choice of inflight entertainment was good. Issues with not much choice on board for snacks/drinks. As part of Economy plus we had breakfast and sand which during 7.5 hour flight, and two rounds of tea/coffee/water/juice and wine.    It’s the only longer haul flight I have been on where staff sleep in the cabin-there were 4 seats reserved to the back of the plane and staff took it in turns to rest. On the way home we had a never plane with leather seating. Again on board entertainment was good, but the earphones they provide you with are not comfortable so make sure you take your own with a jack plug. There is also a USB port under each TV set. Overall was a comfortable flight both ways, small pillow and throw are also provided."
Dec 2019,50,I’m always traveling!,"United is a go to for a lot of people but so expensive! It’s not my go to, but very comfortable. My business travel is not coming out of my pocket so I don’t complain."
Dec 2019,10,Terrible,"Incredibly rude, unhelpful cabin crew, the food was inedible and the drinks service none existent. I have to say I travel quite a lot but this has to be the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to use, lesson learnt, never again."
Dec 2019,40,Good flights.,"On time departures and arrivals. Very comfortable, friendly, good service on the ground and in the air."
Dec 2019,50,Still good flights,United doing their usual efficient job as expected. Best idea was getting the Global Entry card to get back into the US in Houston.  Do NOT try to get Duty free booze through TSA. Put it in checked bags after you buy it. You'll get that chance in Houston.
Dec 2019,40,Necessary family travel,Now that we have retired i solely fly business/first when ever possible. United has not disappointed me. Some craft need to be replaced and am aware that they are in the process of upgrading the fleet. But over all happy.
Dec 2019,10,Delays and no refunds,Late when we left St. Louis!! 51/2 hour delay in Houston. Pushed us from premium to coach and would not refund money I paid extra for seats. On return trip delayed in Denver also. I will never use United again if possible.
Dec 2019,40,Good flight,The flight was in time and the service on the plane (B787) was great. The only issue has been that they checked the carry-on luggage despite the fact that there were many empty spaces in the plane.
Dec 2019,50,Wonderful Service!,What a wonderful experience! The United Gate Agents we very efficient and friendly.  Upon boarding I was greeted with a very warm and courtesous welcome. After being settled into my seat the Flight Attendant made sure we had pillows and blankets for our journey. The whole trip was pleasant.
Dec 2019,40,"If you are over 6'4""...","I'm so glad I paid the little extra for my husband & son to sit in seats 7B & 7C. Both seats are the 1st aisle seats behind ""1st class"" as they provide open leg room for my 6'4"" & 6'6"" tall men.They had more room than in 1st class whose only difference are that the seats are 2"" wider!  Btw, our flight was delayed by 40 mins. & we waited on the plane. Was was great is that unlike most planes this one had the a/c running so we weren't stuffy!"
Dec 2019,50,"Long haul flight . Flight attendants were pleasant and helpful, toilets were ok or better, food (kosher) was ok.","The upgrade was brilliant, in that service and comfort were all so much better.  Some of the joy was wiped away by the presence of many small (some whiny) children in that area. I love children, my own grandchildren, not everybody else's.  Having flown a lot I really have only good things to say."
Dec 2019,40,return flight from Europe,changed aircraft while on a cruise in europe did not get notice of seat change until last minute. let check in know we had booked window/aisle together 1 year earlier. they did a good job rectifying the situation. kudos to gate staff for their help
Dec 2019,20,Too tight for comfort,The seats are too tight. A laptop does not fit on the tray table. The entertainment requires your own device & is mediocre at best. The attendants are courteous & professional. I fly United only when there are no other viable choices.
Dec 2019,50,Great in Flight Experience,"I really enjoyed flying with United for this trip. The flight crew was amazing and friendly. I would have made less layover stops if I had flown from Dulles International Airport, but since I flew from BWI an airport closer to my house I had to make an extra layover in Chicago and then LAX. I was not upset at all about it. No flight delays, even though there was freezing rain warning in Chicago, the flight was on time. I am pretty sure if you map out your airport and the region you are flying from with your United flights, you can get multiple options that are more accordingly to what you like. If more layovers or less layovers."
Dec 2019,20,Poorly managed airline,I was in business class and my husband in 1st class due to a mechanical problem with one plane and we had to change planes @ N. J. instead of Chicago. There was no food in business class - a L-O-N-G route by oneself. The trip occurred 4-5 yrs. ago. I had to select a recent date though. DON'T use United Airlines !!!!
Dec 2019,50,A convenient hop into Texas,I have flown from Indianapolis to Houston several times on United's non-stop flights. They have always been on time. I don't remember problems with any of my flights.
Dec 2019,50,New York break,We was really looked after on our flight to NYC the 7hr flight just went so quickly there was a great selection of films to watch and the crew just kept bringing food and drinks.  BEST AIRLINE we have flown with
Dec 2019,20,Worst Special Needs Assistance ever,"Wheel chair assistance was requested months ago. Confirmed that morning at the New Orleans airport.  No wheel chairs waiting upon exiting. Walked up ramp & asked at United counter. He pointed to a 6 passenger cart & said they would take me. Loaded suitcase & sat down and waited for driver. And waited, and waited. After 10 minutes started walking & walked & walked & walked. Barely made it to the gate on time.  Again verified wheel chair will be at Phoenix terminal. Upon arrival, no wheel chair at gate. Walked up ramp with suit case. A wheel chair was there, but no attendant. Finally a Flight Attendant took pity on me & pushed the me to baggage claim. Thank you to that caring lady!  Not sure who belongs to this problem; the airline or the airport terminals."
Dec 2019,50,Excellent Flight,"While the flight itself was not anything extraordinary, the staff was excellent. They were quite attentive to the needs of many on the flight. They were very friendly, professional, and pleasant throughout the entire flight."
Dec 2019,50,A very good airline,We flight with United at least once a year. This year it’s our second time. It is a good company. The airplane was new and clean. The staff - polite and professional.  They were very punctual. We landed a little before time.  The only problem is that the food is bad.
Dec 2019,40,UA flight,Usually prompt and good service just wish it was a big plane like they used to be back in the day. Small jets have the too cold in the front and too hot in the back.
Dec 2019,40,Great Thanksgiving Day Flight through Chicago O'Hare!,"We had not flown United to SRQ before and were very pleased! We had a layover in Chicago, but flights were in same terminal, so it was great! I would rather have a direct flight, but if layover is needed, this fit the bill. We flew Thanksgiving Day, and will do so again to avoid all of the other holiday travelers. United is improving since the first time I flew with them to Denver 3 or 4 years ago.  Our only complaint is that they boarded so quickly that my hubby, who needs extra time, didn't get to the boarding area quick enough before they called next group!"
Dec 2019,40,Flying Economy,"We were in economy and the airline provided everything you would expect for this type of seat namely good leg room, comfortable seat, cushion, blanket, screen with hugh choice of movies, reasonable meals and plenty of bottled water. Staff friendly and helpful."
Dec 2019,30,Careful!,"We were a family of 6 and had booked way in advance. Despite that, we were spread over 6 different locations. The flight was full, so re-arranging was thwarted. We've learned NOT to buy Basic Economy seats (the least expensive) because they disallow any changes even if you want to pay. That means a high probability of back rows, center seats even if there are empty seats elsewhere. The flights (round trip) were full and other groups were similarly disrupted in seating assignments. The crew was very good though."
Dec 2019,30,India to U.S. - a bit more complicated process than one may be used to in the U.S.,"First, people travelling this route should be aware of the complicated process so that they do not miss their flight. In Mumbai, if you are taking a domestic flight and then connecting to this particular international flight, you will need to clear the immigration before going through security check and then entering the duty free area on the way to the respective gates. My recommendation is that you should try have a target to be at your gate at least an 75 minutes before the flight time because once you get to the gate you will find out that there is another round of security you will have to go through and in this one you will have to take your liquids, computer and even shoes off. SO, DO NOT BUY ANY BIG BOTTLES OF LOTION OR EVEN WATER in the duty free or you will end up throwing it away a few minutes later. This security is very chaotic and does take time. After that you will be in another holding are where I did not see a restroom, so please use that before getting to your gate. You will probably spend 45 minutes or even more before boarding the plane.    This is a long flight. You will be in the plane for almost 16 hours. So, please stretch and drink water. It leaves around midnight and arrives very early in Newark."
Dec 2019,50,From PDX to Denver to Nashville,"I recently traveled for business on United Airlines and it was a good flight even though we had a couple weather delays, the crew on the airplane were very nice and kept us informed of wait times and were helpful when we had to catch a connecting flight."
Dec 2019,50,Flying United Business is unbelievable,"The DC to Zurich leg of flight was absolutely wonderful. Found my seat and ordered a mimosa. Got settled and found all the 'freebies' - a case of lotion, eye pad, etc. There is so much room in Business and the 'cubicles' so so roomy. Dinner offered several choices and I took the braised ribs - which lived up to the raves I'd read. Afterwards, I chose the sundae with they made individually was great. I didn't sleep, although I put she seat in almost prone position. I watched 5 movies!! The staff were very friendly and accommodating, I will definitely fly United business on my next trip overseas. It is worth the price (I did get a special price through our travel agent)."
Dec 2019,40,arrived early,"Check in is easy with the United app, and boarding was no problem. Both going and return flights arrived earlier than scheduled, which is a plus. As is usual on short hop flights light snacks and beverages were offered. Seating was tight going, but return flight had room to stretch out since it was only half full."
Dec 2019,40,Great airline,United runs a non-stop from IND too DEN. Southwest does as well and doesn't come close to the p[rice you can get a seat for on United. Add to that you can select a seat and the airplane is actually clean and 99% on time.
Dec 2019,20,Business class was low economy,Staff was not professional (seemed like apprentices on first day).  We travel a lot (business class).  Seemed disoriented during most of the flight.
Dec 2019,40,Cattle-car boarding,"Once in the seat, all was fine--but  getting onto the plane, with United's boarding by groups, was  bad. Sure, first class strolled on, but we  were in Group C, which meant that by the time we crushed in,  little bin space was left. It might help if United  made sure people followed the reg.s for carry-ons, but they don't.  Jet Blue, here we come."
Dec 2019,40,Decent and quick,Pre-Thanksgiving travel took us to Montreal. United and Air Canada did a great job getting us there with no issues.
Dec 2019,40,Good flight,"On-time departure, professional staff, smooth flight, on-time arrival. Less than 15 minutes from leaving plane to picking up luggage."
Dec 2019,50,LONG non-stop flight from NZ to SF made... bearable.,"We used to fly United all the time because they had the best routes, but over the years their service really declined. We hadn't flown United in a long time, but it ended up being our best deal to return from New Zealand to San Francisco.  What a nice surprise: The service was good, the plane was very clean, the food was surprisingly good and the excellent entertainment package made the 16-hour flight quite bearable.  No one ever looks forward to those long flights, but if we have to do again, we'll definitely look at United again."
Dec 2019,30,Packed Flight,"I am a 1K member .... well, so is everyone else living in the New Jersey/New York area. I have never been able to use the Regional Upgrade Certificates, and by the way, they have changed this altogether! Not sure if it will be for better?! Never mind upgrading to business, I wasn't even able to get onto the Premier Economy, because I had changed my flight last minute."
Dec 2019,40,Good Experience,"We had an easy direct flight from Denver to Puerto Vallarta. Took off a few minutes late, but made up time in the air. Flight staff was helpful and friendly."
Dec 2019,10,United Airlines,"I have flown with multiple airlines and have had marginal experience with all. I was a business traveler for years. I have had the WORST EXPERIENCE with United, they lost my luggage and didn't get it back for 4 days, no follow up calls ....it was wheresmybag.com that located my luggage and had it returned to me. I will NEVER use United again, they are not worthy of ANY business"
Dec 2019,10,Chaos followed by dreadful customer service,"My 6hr flight turned into a 25 hr disaster. The customer service at Dulles for United were the worst I have experienced. At 2am they sent us to multiple service desks to wait in line all over the airport to then be told to go to another, agents told us we were lying when we said we had been sent there. Agents left with lines 30 people deep leaving 1 person to assist. It was one awful inept person after another. I became a loyal JetBlue customer on this United flight."
Dec 2019,30,Cramped and crowded,Worst than an European low-cost.  Please put regular flights between the Hawaiian islands and the Continental US
Dec 2019,50,First Time on United,"I had heard bad things about United Airlines, I never once saw any of the things I had heard. Form the booking agent to check in counter to flight crew they were all very accommodating. Thanks United I will use you again."
Dec 2019,50,Great direct flight,"On our way home United needed to swap out a plane. We were supposed to leave at 10:30 am with a layover in Newark. United asked if we could take a later direct flight, noon, and if so they would upgrade us to Premium Economy with extra leg room. It was they best flight!"
Dec 2019,30,ok,"Ual SEEMS to be getting better. Service was good, but minimal, On time as much as possible...one weather delay (snow in Denver). Seats still terrible, but people want cheap airfares so they cram 'em in!"
Dec 2019,10,"WARNING - UNITED AIRLINES: Nightmare, Plain and Simple","I sat next to a United employee who wasn't ""working"" the flight but was in the capacity of a passenger. Incredibly rude fellow. Ill also. The flight attendents who witnessed his incessant whining and ""size shaming"" took no action. Sitting in the middle seat, probably comfortable for a SMALL child, the trip was miserable. And, the fellow communicated his illness to me - spoiling a two week vacation. United Airlines does put the ""hosptial"" in ""hospitality"". Their reply when notifed of this situation - an amount that would cover a decent meal at a medium priced family restauraunt."
Dec 2019,40,Almost as good as it used to be,"We were actually in the lowest class of Economy, but they still honored all the benefits of Economy except a free checked bag. We were toward the back of the plane, but there were about 8 rows of empty seats behind us, so we could spread out and had no problem with overhead bin space. We actually booked exactly the same flight for 2020, had hope to have the same good fortune.    The seats were a bit cramped, but being able to have a row of seats for my and another for my wife, we were happy campers."
Dec 2019,40,Quick Trip To CA,The staff was delightful and the plane ride there was uneventful. The return flight was delayed severely and the trip was a rough ride.
Dec 2019,40,"Smooth flight, left on time, arrived early, no problems.","No complaints. Friendly service. I was just behind first class, and they let me use the first class restroom instead of making me walk to the back of the plane. More leg room behind the wall separating the two classes than the ones in first class. I enjoyed the flight."
Dec 2019,50,Weather issues handled so well!,"I have now been negatively effected by weather twice in six months (100% hit rate) between Denver and San Francisco. The first was due to weather in Denver in June, and the second due to weather in San Francisco in December - opposite of expected! My review is to not fly between Denver and SFO, but if you have to, fly United! Oh my gosh, both times they handled everything so perfectly: communication, offering options and doing all they could to mitigate something out of their control. At the core of this amazing experience is their mobile app. IMHO, it is the new standard to which all airlines should be measuring themselves. When delayed in June, mid-afternoon, the app alerted me before the text messages started arriving, it let me search for and book an alternate flight with no fees. I changed to the next flight, and got home four hours before the original flight ultimately got there. The app is amazing in other ways too, but the gist is that United has their stuff together. Now they just need to figure out how to fix the weather in all of their major hub cities. ;-)"
Dec 2019,10,Bad Business Class,Plane is dirty  Food is awful and very small portions  The bathroom is disgusting  No blankets or pillows  Flight attendants were lovely.
Dec 2019,40,Best Long Flight,"This was a great flight. Due to my wife’s status with United, she moved me up to Economy Plus. Flight was not full, so I ended up getting a whole row to myself! Since I wanted to get onto East Coast time, I slept immediately, which was not too difficult since it was late afternoon in Japan. Flight attendants didn’t wake me but left food and water for me that I ate when I got up."
Dec 2019,40,We Always Fly United,"We always fly United because it has the most options to get to Roatan (almost every day of the week). The service is comparable to other airlines. We book with miles and upgrade to Economy Plus so we can get in the front of coach for faster immigration processing. If you don't upgrade when going to Roatan, choose seats in the back of the plane because they open the back doors to unload which gets you to immigration faster than sitting in the front of basic economy (middle of the plane)."
Dec 2019,30,Communications Breakdown,"Snow caused delays were understandable but the lack of clarity in communication was monumental. 1st they said the plane was being repaired in Little Rock Arkansas and would be 30 minutes late. Then they said it was till in Little Rock and would be 2 hours late. It went on like this for hours with little or no communication. Finally, after saying the plane would be there around 3:30 pm, United sent our a message saying to be at the gate at 1 pm. We arrived safely after much confusion and little communication from United."
Dec 2019,40,Uneventable Flight Home,The flight was unaventable flight so I was able to get a lot of sleep. The business class Polaris seats are good but still wish they were wider. United has brought back brandy as one of its drink offers. Food was okay but still airplane food.
Dec 2019,50,"Very efficient, no delays, free movies and headphones , no complaints","Very efficient, no delays, free movies and headphones, absolutely no complaints. The stewards were engaging and professional, the Captain kept us informed"
Dec 2019,50,Good option to fly to the USA,"The airline is very punctual, the flight attendants are nice and supportive. The price is not very expensive, but you will need to read carefully the luggage restrictions based upon the ticket you choose (basic economy / economy / economy Premium, etc).  In Houston Airport, the check in process is very technological, you can do it everything by yourself, and then go to the usual customs process.  I liked my experience."
Dec 2019,50,I have taken this flight 10 times and it has always been good,"Arrived at Dulles and went through the checkout and boarding with no problem. Flight was a little over an hour and the steward on the plane was excellent. This is a great flight if you are going to Lake Placid or Montreal, Canada."
Dec 2019,40,Great flight.,"Flight was on time as a typical United flight, clean aircraft and courteous flight attendants The only thing that bother me was the Seats, looks like it time for a refurbishing since the was almost no padding but other then that ill use United in 2 months again."
Dec 2019,20,Delayed flight,"5 hours delay from Glasgow to Newark. On board, staff were courteous and attentive so no fault there. However, when trying to claim compensation for the delay from UA, an absolute shambles and they made it difficult to even make a claim. We received no compensation."
Dec 2019,40,Health issue and super efficiency,"Making a long story short, Due to a bad fall at the airport inSao Paulo I had a painful locked knee but was able to board the plane. Once inside the plane they request a doctor on board to see me. Arriving at Dulles there were an ambulance and two immigration officers to speed up my entry process. From the airport I went straight to Reston Hospital. I did not request any of that but was extremely pleased for United Airlines attention and care."
Dec 2019,40,Nonstop from Australia to Texas,We have taken other airlines on this scheule and non were as comfortable as this one. Although it stated no meals on this 15 hour nonstop flight we were served two. Excellent service and constant availability of water. They dim the lights so you can sleep but we binge watched provided movies. The flight went quick and found the seats comfortable.
Dec 2019,40,Nice Flight,Flight was good with no one in the middle seat. Flight was on time with no delays. I was not familiar with the inflight entertainment on how to use.
Dec 2019,50,Flying can be pleasurable.,"Awesome flight - great attitude and energy from the staff from start to finish, they were helpful and accommodating, and it didn't feel forced or fake - very genuine and kind warm people, working hard to help other people be happy. They also have a good sense of humor, the food was pretty good, and there were a lot of choices for movies. I just got my United card to get some points, will probably use them as my exclusive airline from now on. Thank's guys!"
Dec 2019,50,Kudos to United,We enjoyed ontime service on the flight to and from Washington Dulles. We were comfortable and either on time or early.
Dec 2019,30,Premium economy not worth the price,Even with the extra fee for an premium economy I was so uncomfortable. There is no room to sit and if there are 3 slightly overweight people in a row it is a disaster. Did not sleep a minute. So uncomfortable. Flight was on time. It was also a direct flight.
Dec 2019,20,United Failed,Calling ahead to check disability accessibility was a complete waste of time. When trying to arrange seating for my disabled wife I asked the disability hotline how close to the entrance of the plane we were. I was told 4-5 rows from an entrance when in fact we were 32 rows from the entrance. We will never fly United Airlines again. Thanks
Dec 2019,20,The seat was terrible,"The entire concept of spending extra money for business class was to have comfortable and reclining seating. The chair failed. First. the padding was way to thin with several very hard spots. For a 12 hour duration, my old body cannot tolerate it and I payed the price. I also need to elevate my legs, but the only way to that is to put the head completely flat. So if you want to be in an ""easy chair"" position, forget it. It sucked the big yahoo.Money down the crapper. Oh well- live and learn."
Dec 2019,30,Direct flight and that's it,The flight was good and it was direct. The food and service was just ok. Check-in process was good. The entertainment package was moderate with mostly old movies. The sandwiches they served as snacks was terrible
Dec 2019,50,Thanksgiving travel in and out of San Francisco,"SFO is a humongous airport, dominated by United, and hemmed in by the bay. The traffic loop is an exercize in patience and crawling - but the terminal is modern and spacious. United runs a tight ship - they're dealing with a huge volume of passengers. As long as you have no special needs - you can fly through TSA, and the flights will predominantly be on time. An online boarding pass is available - enabling you to skip the check in line. Know the rules, - number of bags, size of carryon, disallowed items, etc and pack accordingly. Go with the flow, and its a good experience."
Dec 2019,40,Oct trip,Very good flight! Ontime departures and early arrivals! Would rate a 5 but had to pay for baggage roundtrip.
Dec 2019,50,Flight was perfect,All as expected no problems or delays. This flight only had one stop in Houston to Guatemala. Was also an excellent value for our quick getaway.
Dec 2019,40,Pretty good,"I actually loved this flight. Wish there were more non-stop flights on the return flight though. Also, the amount charged for baggage over 50 lbs is slightly ridiculous. Luckily I was able to move stuff around and did not have to pay the overpriced charge."
Dec 2019,20,Wrong seats,"We paid for Economy Plus seats for our leg from Denver to Cancun for our honeymoon and they told us there were not any seats available for us. So we had to sit in regular cramped seats for our longest leg of our trip.  On the way back from Cancun to Denver they told us that we would have to sit in separate seats, not acceptable. My husband did explain to the gate desk that his wife has anxiety flying and it would be in there best interest to make sure we sit together in the economy plus seats that we have paid for. They did make arrangements to have us sit together.  We will not choose to fly United again for there service on seating was unacceptable. Also on other airlines when you book a higher class ticket food and drinks are included. The crew did not listen to our requests when we asked for an additional drinks."
Dec 2019,50,Very professional!,"I was delighted to be heading home after a 7.5 week trip however was feeling tired and could easily have gotten crabby. The seating I had wanted was available as was adequate overhead storage. When I was checking in my checked bag, I found my bag was a couple pounds overweight since I’d purchased too many items while traveling. The woman accepting my bag, instead of jumping on an opportunity to hit me with an overweight charge, suggested I take a couple items from my checked bag and put them in my carryon. This kindness is VERY appreciated! The flight attendants were kind, helpful and good natured making our meal and snack times relaxed and enjoyable. United had emailed me, some months ago, advising me of the Mobile Pass. I’d signed up for the service and used it for the first time on this flight. Mobile Pass is a wonderful, time saving service! I wish all flights were as pleasant as this one!"
Dec 2019,50,GREAT FLIGHT!,"This is our first flight to Houston out of Bentonville. Easy check-in, friendly staff and arrived 15 minutes early! My only complaint would be allowing flyers to still bring in over=packed, large carry-ons! Got luggage immediately after landing."
Dec 2019,40,Nice flight but missed connection,We flew all night The flight went well and the meals given were adequate . We did however miss our connecting flight to Denver only because we could not get our luggage on in time after we passed customs . The customer service was excellent though gave us free food vouchers so it worked out just fine . We did catch the next flight and made our last flight to home in Winnipeg.
Dec 2019,40,Need more water,"The flight was long, but enjoyable. You make it what it is. Since I donated a kidney months earlier I needed to stay hydrated. Plus part of jet lag is not enough water. I called ahead to make sure I could get enough they said no problem. Well.....  I was disappointed that I couldn’t get a liter of water, so I learned on this trip to bring plenty of water with me. Interesting how you can buy all the alcohol you want but you can’t buy a liter of water! Over all the flight went extremely well with no delay. I will use United again, I’ll just bring plenty of water with me."
Dec 2019,20,Long Flight - Little service,"It’s great that you can fly direct from Chicago to Maui. However, that’s about the only good thing if you fly below first class. First off, this is considered a domestic flight despite its 9+ flight time. So, flying in economy (premium economy!) doesn’t provide for a free checked bag or even a free meal. You fly over lunch and dinner and you have to purchase any food or snacks. Ridiculous! As far as entertainment, bring an iPad or phone because there is no seat back entertainment. They do provide a latch system for a phone or small tablet that is nice because your device fits where a screen normally would go. If you have a large tablet (iPad pro) it won’t fit.    Finally, the plane is 3x4x3. Sitting in premium economy, the 2 middle seats share legroom. Yeah, share with a stranger the limited space. Insane! It was a decent amount of legroom (I’m 6’2).    Overall it’s a rough flight for coach. But Hawai’i is worth it! Just maybe do 2 flights of sell your first born for first class."
Dec 2019,40,early arrival at connection meant free time for the arrival day,"Flight was ORD-DEN-ELP, United got us to DEN very early so I was able to catch a flight 2 hours earlier than expected which made the day way less stressful"
Dec 2019,10,Dreadful,"As with almost all flights on United this one was late. Several hours. The in flight entertainment system didn't;t work properly (3rd time in 6 flights). The food choice was effectively one item - the attendant told me they never have enough selection. The aircraft was cold and the staff didn't care that almost everyone was sitting wearing a coat.  It is interesting that since United have become profitable they don't give a damn about customer service. And their treatment of members of their 'Loyalty' program is appalling - they reduce the benefits of being a frequent flyer every year. (Their upgrade voucher program for 1K passengers - 100,00 miles per year! - is a scam as the only way you can use it is to buy the most expensive tickets and spend the same anyway)  UNITED IS INCOMPETENT, INEFFICIENT AND ONLY CARE ABOUT GETTING MONEY OUT OF THEIR PASSENGERS"
Dec 2019,50,Great Flight,"Despite bad weather in Chicago that was our final destination and rain in Toronto everything went very smoothly. Really appreciated the message we had gotten from United earlier in the day that there were bad weather conditions in Chicago. The message outlined what some of our options were. Even though we did t. We’d to use any of them, it was still. Nice heads up."
Dec 2019,40,Excellent flights,"After hearing all the bad things about United I wasn’t particularly looking forward to this flight. What a pleasant surprise! Our flights were right on time, got in early a couple times (msp to San Francisco, then to Kona). The only negative was the connections that we had. We had a 9 hr layover in San Francisco because they changed our flight and a 6 hour layover on the way back. Made for 2 really long days! We tried to change them but it would have cost us big dollars so we did what we had to do. The flight attendants were great, very personable and helpful. The food, in first class, was not good, not sure what it was we ate even for one meal! But overall no complaints about flights being on time and the service."
Dec 2019,30,Cannot compare to the Asian airlines,This was a 17.5 hour flight and the length of time was brutal even in Business/First.  The attendants were very nice and attentive but food was more in keeping with economy class!
Dec 2019,40,United Airlines Review,I would have to say United Airlines is not a bad plane to pick! We where treated with respect and there was absolutely nothing wrong with our experience. I would bring a portable charger because some of the planes do not have a place to charge your phone. And I would also pay the extra to pick your own seat just so you are comfortable. Also gum or something to help the popping of the ears. I would totally use United again!
Dec 2019,10,"10 people at the gate 5 min late, would NOT open door!! RUDE people","Our contracted Lufthansa flight was 30 min late, we had to sprint to immigration then wait 20 min in line, then sprint to gate Z from A in Frankfurt. There were 10 people on our flight connecting. Boarding ended at 4:55, we all ran and got there at 4:58-5:00 the plane was still there, they had just shut the door. They would NOT let us board, we all had to stay the night in Frankfurt to find a flight the next day. The United crew at gate were extremely rude, and would not help us out at all. They just said it is Lufthansa's issue not United's. To make matters worse I get a notification that our flight landed in DC 35 min EARLY!!! They could have opened that door for all of us."
Dec 2019,40,We flew first class and it was a lot nicer than coach,I wish the airlines would treat everyone like they do in first class. Air travel would be so much nicer.
Dec 2019,20,Premier 1K for 4 years and United is not impressive,"I have been Premier 1K status for four years now and have been absolutely unimpressed with United as an airline for the following reasons:    1. Of the airlines I’ve flown (Lufthansa, Singapore, Lot, Cathay Pacific etc), United cleanliness is that of some discount airlines such as EasyJet and CebuPacific. United bathrooms are horrific. (BTW, about 1.5 hours before landing on a flight to Barcelona from Newark, the plane ran out of water for the bathroom and to make coffee.)    2. Flight attendants are not as warm and friendly, and at times, professional like my experience on Lufthansa, Singapore and Cathay Pacific. L    3. Quality of food in business class is sub-par compared to mentioned major airline carriers. Wine choice, not not critical is also sub-par.    4. This one is HUGE: An ex-United flight attendant once told me that United doesn’t care about other passengers unless you have Global or Platinum 1K elite status. Even at 1K, I have found their customer service inadequate. For example, how is it that United cannot provide business class passengers their first preference for food? No other airline asks me what my 1st, 2nd, or 3rd choice is for food, they know how to do the math! Another example, I was significantly delayed on a business flight coming back from Frankfurt to Newark. United rerouted me to fly connecting to Washington DC and get in at mid-night while there was a much better flight that would get me to Newark in the early evening. I had to spend quite a bit of time to get on that flight. And the time was simply being on hold. In addition, about 2 weeks later, I informed United of what happened, it took many conversations for someone to then inform me that by law, the EU had to compensate me with $600 (or Euros, I don’t remember which currency) but I would not have gotten it if I did not complain about the horrible experience.    I have plenty more examples of poor service on United. And United is not exactly cheaper / less expensive than Lufthansa or Singapore. I would recommend that you fly with these other airlines before flying United. Please feel free to write to me should you have more questions about United, Lufthansa, or Singapore."
Dec 2019,20,Threw my 92 yr old mother-in-law off a cart in Houston,"We had to stop in Houston on Dec.3rd at 5 AM then get on another flight to Ft. Lauderdale, with a 2 hour layover. My mother-in-law had a wheelchair and a attendant once she was off the airplane directed her to another vehicle to take her to our connection. We got on the vehicle and minutes later a woman identifying herself as CICELY CAMRON ordered us off the vehicle stating my 92 yr old lady was not on the list. We then had to walk the lengthy distance to the gate for FLL stopping several times and resting.... UNCONSCIONABLE!"
Dec 2019,30,Delayed All Day,"Our flight was delayed ""due to weather"" in the middle of July(no rain anywhere in the country). We were supposed to take off at 1pm and wasn't able to until 9pm that night. This caused us to miss our flight in Dallas to get home. United Airlines did not help us with a hotel room, so we paid to stay in a room to maybe get 4 hrs sleep. We found out when we got home that there were no weather issues, but that United Airlines was having stffing issues. They lied to us and we paid for it."
Dec 2019,30,Flight was Delayed; Poor Excuses,"This flight started with some discomfort. First, the departure was delayed, with no consistent explanation, other than agreement on the new departure time. Second, there was another 15 minute delay. Third, we were told that a defective part of the HVAC system required another lengthy delay—duration not estimated. Fourth, we boarded the plane. Fifth, when the plane had been boarded, we were all ordered off the plane— no reason. Sixth, we received a message that there was a possible bird strike. Now, the plane had not pushed back from the gate. Seems more fishy than bird-like. Seventh, after another delay, OMG, No Bird Strikes. Finally, we reboarded—pillows and blankets somehow missing—and could be replaced—and we had an uneventful flight.    This is quintessential United treatment. Enjoy!"
Dec 2019,30,CBUS,"Small jet with limited service and uncomfortable seats. This plane doesn’t have room for roll aboard bags so you need to gate check them and pick them off at your destination. As it’s a smaller jet they tend to skimp on service. One cup of a drink, pretzels or biscoff but no refills or water offered the rest of the flight. This is a three hour flight so hard to stay hydrated when they are servicing. Entertainment via the United app only WiFi rarely works on these small jets so bring a book or magazine. This plane also has the new style seats with no cushion they are hard and your back will hurt by end of flight impossible to be comfortable. We landed in Denver we had to exit outdoors and wait for bags. It’s a long long walk to the exit. Wear walking shoes and it’ll take you 20 mins to get to the exit at least"
Dec 2019,30,"OK, But not the Best!","I took this flight primarily to see if the new Polaris business class lived up to the advertising. The business class lounge at SFO was a big improvement over the previous one. As for the flight itself, it was OK (certainly better than pre-Polaris), but not up to the standard offered by the competition in terms of menu, service or comfort. In future if I'm flying to a destination served by several airlines including United, I will certainly consider flying with someone else. United prices are higher and the value is lower."
Dec 2019,40,"On time at every juncture, and more efficient and prepared than I've previously experienced.","Flight from Charlottesville, VA to San Antonio, TX, connected at Dulles. It was Thanksgiving Day, and all personnel were helpful and on their toes to make things work efficiently."
Dec 2019,40,"on time, nice flight, no issues","can't complain.. even with deicing, we arrived ahead of schedule, flight was comfortable, luggage was delivered promptly upon arrival... all is good"
Dec 2019,40,vacation,I highly suggest first class for longer than a hour flight just for the space to be comfortable. Economy you feel like you are packed in.
Dec 2019,50,Pleasantly Surprised,"I booked my return flight from Costa Rica using my miles. When things went south I decided to come home early. I knew there was a fee for changing my flight but I wasn't sure exactly how much it was. So, I called.    The lady on the phone searched for an available flight first. She found the one that I wanted and asked if I would like to book that one. First, I need to know how much it's going to cost! The change fee is $125 but she can help me with that. I was thinking she would knock off part of the cost. No, she waived it entirely!    There was a problem with their system so she kept me on the phone for quite a while. But, that's because she wanted to be sure that my flight change was in their system before I got off the phone.    I ended up with a much better flight and it cost me nothing at all. This kind gesture was greatly appreciated in a time of high stress.    I couldn't figure out why all of the ground crew at the airport was taking photos and videos of the plane. Well... it turns out I was on the only Star Wars plane in the fleet!"
Dec 2019,50,United Airlines did a great job,I have been taking this trip for a few months now and have not run into any issues. The UA staff has been an absolute delight to work with.  The flights are always on time if not early and the planes are clean and comfortable.
Dec 2019,30,Wellllllll!!!,I enjoyed the service!! The flight was long nonstop to LA the Seats are tight so get comfortable with your neighbor. The if you are in row 1-22 you have a charge port on most planes. And by all means enjoy your free TV.
Dec 2019,50,There was no interesting events on the flight.,"Great airline never fly with anyone else. The pilot came out of the cockpit and spoke to the passengers and joked around I have never seen anything like it, it was great."
Dec 2019,40,Denver to Frankfurt non-stop - GREAT!,"Denver to Frankfurt NONSTOP on a brand new 787 Dreamliner - Great!! From Frankfurt you can get anywhere, and the train station is integrated with the airport. How civilized! USA, listen up!"
Dec 2019,30,"THey call it Business, but it really is not up to snuff","I travel back and forth often from Berlin to Newark, and as this is the only direct flight I take it often. And I am always disappointed with the service. The attendants are not really friendly, the service rushed, and the menus have not changed in over a year. It gets you there but without much style. I always try to fly another Star Alliance partner even though I have to change planes."
Dec 2019,30,Expect delays and poor service,"We are frequent flyers on United. Since the last couple of years, United has increased its flights, which is something we appreciate, but the delays are making us rethink whether it is worth it to continue to fly on United. Once again, during our recent trip to Houston from Phoenix, our flight was delayed by over half an hour. This was not too bad, but our connecting flight to Panama City was delayed by 5 hours! It was frustrating. The United Terminal in Houston is a sleepy place with very little choice of good and healthy food. There is not much to do for five hours there. We walked all around and yet had hours to kill! I don't know how long we'd like to use United for our travels."
Dec 2019,10,Worse than my last bad experience on United Airlines.,"Didn’t think it could get worse but it did. Panel to storage broken, had to put overhead luggage in economy. Dirty napkin and candy wrapper in seat pocket. One toilet in back of plane, serving 82 people, no first class facility. Kleenex box empty. Very cold grey chicken and odd “slaw” for lunch. No place for coats. What did the $159 extra that I paid for 1st Class get me? Nothing."
Dec 2019,40,Excellent ground Customer Service,Very Professional ground Staff. They were able to switch my flight do to weather and Thanksgiving week
Dec 2019,10,3rd rate First Class,"Pretty bad experience. Seat 1A, a bulkhead, had a locked storage compartment above my seat. Nowhere to stow my carry on except in economy section behind me. Air vent above me did not work, and seat back did not recline. For several hundred dollars less, I could have sat in Economy and availed myself of all of the above, plus the ""free"" pretzels."
Dec 2019,10,Worst airline for customer service,"Flight from Ft Lauderdale delayed (no plane), then canceled (no crew). Ended up on a bus to Key West. Return flight from Key West was canceled. No avail flights for 3 days. No rental cars to be had. Rented and paid for shuttle to Miami to get a plane (Delta) the next day. Continuously told to call United.com for help (useless). Tried to get a refund, but were constantly told that we had to do it ""online"" and wait. Finally got an email reply that they would reimburse $100 for each of us (husband and wife), which didn't come close to paying our expenses. The most frustrating thing about this was that there is NO ONE to talk to. Everything is online only. We bought travel insurance, but that only helps if WE had canceled."
Dec 2019,20,employees always seem so unhappy,Not sure why we keep flying on United. I guess the cheap prices. But the flight attendants and gate agents seem to not be happy. Even rude at times with their short answers.  Travelling the holidays is already difficult enough. For them to make it more difficult is just another stressor.
Dec 2019,30,Good flight,Another uneventful flight (which are the best kind). Left on time and arrived on time. The service was good.
Dec 2019,40,Great flight,"Frankfurt is a very efficiency run airport where it links up to every imaginable type of transportation. We stayed right above the airport, so it took literally 3 mins to get to the check in. Our flight attendants were very seasoned(old), yet friendly and accommodating to our needs. Our seats were very comfortable, but I don’t want to announce to the world which ones they were because I want to get them again. Our food was ok, but fed you often which made the time went by quickly. We got in 30 mins ahead of schedule!"
Dec 2019,10,Customer Service,"Horrible Customer Service. I needed to connect with customer service to add a lap infant for international travel. I could not get through to customer service due to over an hour wait times on their phone line. **FINALLY get through to them a few days before the flight. You're charged 10% of the fare at the time of adding the infant. Not your original booking fare. Mind you, the infant is on your lap!!  Well, that fare has obviously now gone through the roof. Do not book with United if you'd like any level of service."
Dec 2019,50,Surprisingly Good flight over the Holidays,The flight was very easy and on time. There were no delays and we arrived earlier than expected. This was surprising due to my travel occurring over the Thanksgiving Holiday. It was a pleasant flight overall.
Dec 2019,10,Wow! Shockingly bad.,"Outgoing flight was cancelled the night before due to ""weather."" Some how the weather wasn't negatively effecting any other flights. The in-bound is now delayed 2+ hours due to delays in aircraft at other airports that have been a domino effect for the last 12+ hours. Hard to believe there is no logistical solution other than kicking the can. If I had other options I would pay more to fly with anyone else. May go with Alaska next time even with a stop over this ""direct"" mess."
Dec 2019,50,Professional and helpful,"The United States is not the simplest place in the world to transit through, but the United ground crew in Cancun seems to be well versed in helping their passengers deal with stressful visa hick ups, and that was something I benefitted from. In the end all went well, and the airline got us home on time. For such a short flight I was also pleasantly surprised to see that there was a real business class compartment on the plane. Being of the tall construction every inch counts."
Dec 2019,40,NICE TRANS-ATLANTIC FLIGHT,"We flew United flight 52, IAD - ZRH on 12/7, on a 767-400. Boarding started late due to repairs on a seat. Wheels up at 1821. The crew was not overly friendly, but pleasant.  Dinner was served at 1945, after drinks/nuts and appetizers. For dinner I had the lemongrass salmon, which was just a touch spicy. Ice cream sundae for dessert. An hour out of Zurich, breakfast was served, and I had the Urban cream cheese omelet, with chicken sausage. The sausage left a lot to be desired. Arrived at the gate, after a brief taxiway hold, at 0731. 24 minutes early. Very comfortable flight, great entertainment selection and all features worked great."
Dec 2019,40,"ABOVE AVERAGE FLIGHT, NO ISSUES","We flew United flight 546 SAN - IAD on 12/7. The aircraft was a 737-900, domestic workhorse, arrived at SAN and within 20 minutes were through check-in and security. Then to the United club for breakfast.  Boarding started at 0740, cabin door closed at 0805 and wheels up at 0825.  Service was very good with a great first class crew, especially Jeff. Very affable.  For breakfast I had the French toast/raspberry souffle and cinnamon roll. It also came with 2 links of very good sausage.  Overall a quite comfortable flight. We landed at Dulles at 1539 and arrived at the gate at 1545 about 15 minutes early."
Dec 2019,20,Don't fly with United Airlines,"Very bad service as always, old planes , no plugging for devices , not enough room for suitcases , delayed , and the flight attendat didnt even speak well Spanish to be translating. He was destroying our beautiful language with every word.    But the worse staff was Pauline, a very rude lady at Customer Service in Sn. Fco. I wish I could have had my phone to video tape her and make it viral! I forgot my phone on the plane, so security sent me with her to be helped and all what she had to say was""sorry about you looss"" She had NO idea how to help me or provide ""customer service"" , she told me that it was nothing to do but an online complain and ""see"" . When I left her booth I asked a Philipino cleaning lady if she knew what I could do and she kindly responded : Go to lost and found , the cleaning crew will bring it there. And she was right ! No claim online needed . I cant believe that she knew better .  I will never give my money to a company wish treats clients like that !!"
Dec 2019,30,Uneventful flight,The best kind of flights are the uneventful ones. Left on time and arrived early. (And didn’t have to wait for a gate). The service was pleasant
Dec 2019,10,Feels like punishment,"Flying economy United gives you the feeling of being punished. You cannot get your boarding pass online, since they want to check the size of your personal item (no carry on), so you have to check in at the airport. When you get there, half of the machines do not work and there are no enough supervisors to approve your bag. If the size of your bag is not very tiny, they ask you to it check in for a fee. They ask you to remove your laptop, medicine, etc. and carry them in your hand. This is harrasment.  Also they ask you to place your coat on the floor under your seat. Why am I forced to place my coat on a dirty floor? United, why are you treating the passengers so horribly?"
Dec 2019,30,Subway in the air,Just a flying cattle car. Paid for seat upgrade for a bit more legroom but still very narrow seat. Every seat filled. Low overhead bins. Can’t move in any direction. Had been flying Jet Blue out of JFK for this trip but JFK is twice the distance compared to Newark. Back to Jet Blue for April trip.
Dec 2019,30,Why are most planes for HNL flights 737?,"I was three flights. From Houston to LAX we were on a Dreamliner. Transfer to HNL flight and one of the least air travel planes awaits. As a 1k flyer, nearly 3 mil mile flyer and always purchase business or first class tickets having to fly 737 planes are disappointing."
Dec 2019,10,Overcharged and 2 day delay,"This flight cost us about $2,500 and took 2 days to fly home. They offered us money to take a later flight then did not honor that. Once we got to the SFO airport they held us on the plane for almost 1 hour. The air on the plane was not working."
Dec 2019,20,Uncomfortable Seats in First Class,"I cannot believe how uncomfortable the first-class seats are. They are like sitting on an inch of foam over concrete. The huge cost difference is truly not worth the money on this airline! They do have some laydown seats on some flights. They are amazing, but the regular first-class seats are ridiculous."
Dec 2019,30,Good flight,"We left PUJ on time and got to IAD a little early. This is always appreciated.    The flight itself was fine. The cabin was standard 737 with seat back screens in FC. Service was fine. The brisket dinner was fairly bad....the chocolate chip cookie was good.    Our luggage was on the carousel as soon as we cleared Customs, which was fairly fast."
Dec 2019,40,Very good,"We took this flight the day after Thanksgiving. I normally fly AA; however, they had changed their flight schedules and would not provide a reasonable re-route. For that, they lost two paid first class customers.    We left on time and arrived early. It might have helped that it was a slow day at IAD and the aircraft had been sitting since the day before but we certainly appreciated the prompt service. The FA service was excellent. They were friendly and efficient. The raspberry bread pudding for breakfast was actually pretty good (usual for airline food).    The seats were standard FC in a 737. Unfortunately, there was neither a pillow nor a blanket available. This really isn't acceptable in FC.    It's rare that I rate a flight above 3 stars, but United did a good job."
Dec 2019,10,It's United,"United always has the worst service, I don't understand how this is an airline that still operates. Always with the delays. I always make sure to do anything I can to make sure we're not on a United flight."
Dec 2019,50,Enjoyable flight,While we left the gate ten minutes late we made the time up enroute and arrived on time. Having DirectTV I was able to watch Monday night football the whole flight.  Nice leg room and a smooth flight added to the relaxed atmosphere.
Dec 2019,10,Last Try With United Airlines,"Just a girl sitting at the terminal with a pissy look on her face because of another delayed United Airlines flight yet again. So, I decided to write a review for the first time in my life. Our credit card company is partnered with United Airlines. So, we’ve used points to fly United multiple times. Every time, without fail, the flight is always delayed. We fly at least once or twice a month and have never had this many headaches from another airline. The worst experience I’ve had is the night before a 6am flight receiving a text message at 2am saying that the flight would be delayed 2 hours, then getting a text at 4am saying the flight is going back to its original time (6am). I’ll let you imagine the stress of trying to get to the airport in time when you’ve just received a notice that your plane is leaving in 2 hours on no sleep 🤪. We fly a ton. This is not the nature of the beast. This is United Airlines. We’ll be changing credit card companies and airlines. Sorry, Chase 🤷🏻‍♀️"
Dec 2019,40,Very timely and Convenient,"Flight left right on time. Even though the airports are extremely congested and busy we were slotted and got off as expected. Quick flight to San Diego and then a quick exchange and direct flight to Tampa arrived early. Flight attendants were great, could always use my room but that’s airline travel in this day and age."
Dec 2019,40,First Time Flyers with United,"First Time with United. When we arrived at the Terminal, 1pm, I received a text to say there was a four hour delay. Original time 6pm, new time 10pm. Also told we would be put on standby. Unfortunately we were not able to get on the 4pm flight.    Overall experience, United Airline staff from start to boarding the plane was very good. Unfortunately spending so long at the airport before we left put a dampner to the start of our break.    Advise, legroom in the middle aisle is a bit limited. Window seats has that little bit extra room which was a bonus on the return trip.    As it was the middle of the night when we arrived at Newark it was quite smooth going through customs.    In flight entertainment and food was very good, not very pushy either    And they also keep you updated with text messages which can be very handy"
Dec 2019,20,Oh boy....,"Okay, so my flight was on a 777-200, so as always it was kinda fun flying on such a big bird. However, I wasn’t really expecting much which was exactly right. As my flight was flying over the most northern part of Alaska, we found out there was water leak in the aircraft and hence, we had to make an unexpected landing in Anchorage, Alaska. We sat on the ramp for like 30 minutes to an hour. Later, we were told that since we stopped the crew would time out if we continued over the pacific. So, we then flew to San Francisco to get a new crew. After getting to San Francisco, we deplaned and were told we would get a new crew and plane. However, this was listed as a different flight ( :| ) so everyone thought they needed to exit the secure area and rebook their tickets because United told us NOTHING(!!!) about if we were automatically booked in to this flight. Later, we found we were automatically rebooked, but our bags weren’t. Being around 4:00 AM in San Francisco there were about 3 counters open (keeping in mind the 777-200 holds 400+ passengers) so there was this HUGE line to check out bags BACK IN and heck, let’s add in around 400 tired passengers! Eventually, everyone was taken care of... but security didn’t open til’ 6:00 AM, so I found a place to sit... and sit... for an hour. Here I was pondering is I should even go on with the flight is this is how United is treating it’s passengers. After security opened, we were shortly able to board the new plane which was dirty, and frankly disgusting. IT’S LIKE THEY DIDN’T EVEN CLEAN IT! There were weird crumbs on my seat, surprise gum in the seat back pocket and the window shade thing was sticky. For the money I payed for that flight, I don’t think so. We made it to Tokyo... a day or so late. The FAs were great on both flights, but the thing was, for how the airline employees treated the customers in terms of communication, and cleanliness. Would I fly United again international? NO. I would much rather use my Star Alliance statues and flight on ANA or Eva. But I am still going to fly United Trans-continental due to the fact that I hate Delta and American, I just hate United less. :/ Thanks for taking a day in Tokyo from me for a stressful, out of control night.    Photos: First photo at ORD taxing. I wish I was on that JAL flight... Photo two: the aircraft was dumping fuel over northern Alaska so that we are less heavy when we land in anchorage."
Dec 2019,50,Always fly United,"For the past 5 years, we have exclusively flown United. Only rarely a delayed flight. Excellent flight attendants and pilots. Smooth flying. Seats are comfortable, but could always be better. What more could we ask?"
Dec 2019,20,Inconsistent and illogical.,"I flew Bogotá to Houston (1008) then onto Edmonton (2268) both flights with United, in Business Class, and neither flight felt as luxurious as they should.    The crew were helpful and friendly and there was the complimentary drinks, glasses and metal cutlery, nice wide seats and good legroom, as you would expect in Business Class.    What let them down is as follows:  1/ The in-flight entertainment was appalling. In Bogotá to Houston it was via a small seat-back screen, with a very limited selection of movies, that you couldn’t play on demand or pause. On Houston to Edmonton it was via personal devices only, albeit a far better selection of movies & TV.  2/ On Bogotá to Houston we had blankets, it was a breakfast flight, but no pillow. That small pillow can vastly improve the comfort, either as lumber support or round the neck. On Houston to Edmonton, where they turned the lights off for a couple of hours, there was no blanket or pillow, which makes no sense.  3/ I have coeliacs so always request a gluten-free meal. The breakfast on the Bogotá to Houston flight was fine (although they did put a croissant on my tray then whip it away when I asked if it’s gluten free). Yet on the Houston to Edmonton flight everyone had a choice of hot dinner but there was nothing for me. I was told they don’t offer special meals on domestic flights, to which I say:  i) Houston USA to Edmonton, Canada is not domestic, so that makes no sense  ii) Tell us at the time of booking so we can make provisions  iii) it was a similar length flight as Bogotá to Houston, with a hot dinner, so once again that makes no sense.    The stewardess was apologetic and kind, providing a ‘Select Box’ of nuts, seeds and gluten free cookies, but one doesn’t fly Business Class to have snacks while everyone around you is eating a hot meal.    4/ The cabin is dated and a bit grubby around the edges, with no USB charging point.  5/ on the Bogotá to Houston flight I had to go and ask the crew for water, they sat and chatted for hours instead of checking in on us. (The opposite applied Houston to Edmonton, they were excellent, very attentive).    In short, I won’t waste money flying business with United again, it was very sub-standard."
Dec 2019,10,"""Clueless"" United","1. United ""Hemispheres"" magazine-- with both flights on 03Dec...the November 2019 issue was in the seat pocket. For those who PAID to Advertise for the 31 days of December 2019, 3 days are MISSED out...1/10 of the month. What a DISSERVICE, that the Advertisers Message isn't gotten out in those 3 days ??  2. When I was disembarking in Heathrow, I picked up a menu (beverage list was an ""insert"") from Business Class, when we passed through the cabin. I enjoy viewing menus and was COMPELTELY STUNNED, that there was NO listings for the Champagne, wines, port & dessert wine !!!!!!! It indicated to ""consult with your Flifght Attendant for today's selections"". What a HUGE DISSERVICE !!! No Synopsis of the items: year of Vintage, country of origin, tasting notes & finish results. Zero !!  1. the Flight Attendants are RACING to get the meal served, so Passengers can  SLEEP...they don't have TIME to discuss wine details, if they even know about  them.  2. Some Flight Attendants don't drink, and on NUMEROUS occasions, they have  kinda BLUNTLY advised me ""I don't drink (as if to say ""I don't have ANY IDEA  of Tasting notes, etc "".)"".  3. Does Doug Frost, the Wine Expert for United NOT provide this Info to United ??  4. Lufthansa, NOT only provides a ""synopsis"", it has a picture of the bottle  (in color), both in First & Business Class. Noble Lufthansa, NOT Sloppy & Shoddy  United !!  5. with Delta Business Class, its kinda personalized with helpful comments from their  Wine Expert, Andrea Robinson...Nice touch.  6. I will AVOID United Business Class...just NOT worth it, they Leave you IN THE  DARK when it comes to Champagne, Wines, Port & Dessert Wine.    When I mentioned this NO synopsis of Champgne, Wines, Port & Dessert Wine to  my colleagues, they indicated How ""ClueLESS"" United was and they AVOID United  totally. Sad, sad, SAD and United is attempting to Promote its ""Polaris Business Class"" ?! ?! They are off to a Cheap start, with NO synopsis. WHAT are they THINKING ?! ?! ?! ?!    The Flight Attendant to London, they distribute a SMALL bottle of water after the meal service...NO water offered during the night that's a -0-. On a recent Delta International flight...every hour or Less, they came around with a tray of water or juice. The LAZY United Cabin Crew...welllll, they just didn't CARE."
Dec 2019,10,Check in nightmare,If you get there when they need your seat and are offering money for it be on guard because they will lie to you and say you don't have time to get a boarding pass. Also the self check in kiosks are a nightmare. Not sure why United is so unfriendly.
Dec 2019,30,Chaotic Check-In,"I am usually relatively happy with United’s service and pleased with my overall experience. But this time my trip started with headaches and incompetence. So when I got to Dulles, the economy check-in area was pure chaos so this pushed me to upgrade to business. First I was greeted by a lady at the premier section by a lady who wouldn’t let me in. After I was a tad forceful, she let me in. I then waited in line where the employee at the counter was more interested in chatting with her colleagues then working. While I was in line, I helped another lady check-in at a kiosk as there was no one helping anybody. I finally changed lines and again the person didn’t know what they were doing. Finally I just went to a kiosk and did it myself. The baggage lady was more helpful but she didn’t give me my luggage stub.    Now the flight itself was great. The business class crew were attentive and made sure I had everything I needed. The inflight entertainment was consistent and we ended up landing 20 minutes early after leaving on time. United needs to get better counter employees."
Dec 2019,40,Going to a Funeral,"A 777; lots of entertainment options. The flight was full and not enough overhead bin space (as usual). I had to wander around the cabin to find a place for my SINGLE item. The flight crew would not order checking of the excess carry-on baggage. Otherwise, the flight was good.    We landed almost one hour early - thanks to a 150+ mph tailwind, then we sat on the ground for an hour until a gate opened.    Such is travel these days."
Dec 2019,40,Hate Redeye Flights,No gate agent until a few minutes before boarding time on boarding pass. No announcement we were waiting for connecting flight passengers. Flight attendants missed the middle seat passenger next to me had his backpack blocking the foot area and not under seat in front of him. Loved the United club though!
Dec 2019,20,Rude staff,"Rudest staff I have ever experienced. They wouldn’t let us sit in the seats we had reserved because the staff wanted to sit there, but they remained empty for the entire journey. Very odd and annoying."
Dec 2019,30,Long Flight Without Meal Service and Wi-Fi along with Marginal Entertainment,"I am almost a United 3 Million Miler and a 1K Flier with over 200k miles this year. So, I fly United Airlines a lot.    Non-Stop Flight 1736 between Denver and Maui on December 2 was a great disappointment for three reasons:    1. There was no meal service for a 6.75 hour flight between Denver and Maui.  2. I was not able to connect to Wi-Fi the entire trip to check my business e-mails.  3. There were no in-flight TV screens to watch movies and TV shows which is very unusual to me on flights of this duration. There was entertainment via passenger electronic devices. However, I had three grand children who did not have such devices. Had I known that this long flight did not have in-flight TV screens, I could have brought the grand kids' I-Pads.  As a result, I feel that United failed to provide the normal service that I would expect from a long United flight like the one we took between Denver and Maui."
Dec 2019,30,Cold Cabin,"Flight was on time and fairly packed. I paid extra to move up a group so I could get my bag in the overhead before it got full.  Journey was good, landing a tad earlier than expected. Meal served was average but service was good.  Only complaint would be the temperature. It was pretty cold in the cabin. So much so that I had to use one of the blankets provided which I never do. Other passengers were wearing coats and using blankets. I heard one of the stewardesses mention it was hot and she was going to put the temperature down. She should have paid more attention to the passengers and what they were wearing."
Dec 2019,20,Disappointed,This flight was half filled in economy and we were stuffed like sardines in the back of the plane. We could not spread out unless we paid an extra $100 some odd dollars to move! LIterally there were rows and rows of empty seats in the front of economy.  Outrageous!!
Dec 2019,50,Really great service and experience,"I was traveling on the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend. I have flown United several times, all enjoyable. But on this trip, I was especially observant of the work the flight attendants do, and their professional and friendly attitudes.    It was a 5:30pm flight. And yet the two flight attendants up front stood and welcomed each and every passenger with a smile and a greeting. I was flying first class mostly because this was a last minute flight and it was the only seat available. The service and food was excellent.    My only complaint was that I could not get my laptop connected to the airplane's wifi service. This was not the first time I had issues with wifi with United. But on the other hand, it was not urgent that I use it, so I did reading and resting."
Dec 2019,30,The Value of United's Mileage Plus,"Please be aware that your hard earned Mileage Points only earn you the right to stand by when you upgrade. You pay with miles and dollars, but you cannot choose your seat, nor are you guaranteed a seat. You won't know whether your upgrade that you paid for will be granted until anywhere from a couple of days to just 30 minutes before boarding. As far as I can tell, nowhere is this fact mentioned. You find out after the fact.  Also be aware that if there is no direct flight, and you connect somewhere, PART of your flight may be in economy, and part in business, but you will NOT get compensated for the hours you sat in economy. The dollar amount that you paid and the miles you were charged will not be adjusted.  There is an elaborate pecking order for your standing on the wait list. How far in advance you purchased the ticket, even if you purchased the ticket with your United credit card, counts for little.  It ids too bad that management has structured the Mileage Plus Program in such a fashion. The business class experience -- service, legroom, food --is excellent.    I used to be a loyal United (formerly Continental) customer. No more."
Dec 2019,10,United does not back booking through them with their partners,"Do not book with United. I orginally booked a round trip flight through united for Air Canada. Air Canada canceled one of the flights and United still charged me for the round trip giving me a ticket that was a one way. I called on 11/26/2019 to get it sorted out and they told me they could only refund the whole thing because the flight was technically Air Canada and it was a system error. If I had not noticed, I would have never been notified by United that my second flight was canceled. I had to rebook both my flights that were 100s of dollars more. The refund should have taken 7 days and I should have recived a confirmation number within 24 hours by email. I called again on 02/03 and asked for the status because I did not revieve the refund or confirmation email. They said that it was still processing and I should recieve and email in 24 hours. I called again 02/06 because I still did not have a refund or email. I was finally able to get someone on the phone from the refunds department who said my refund was still in a queue and was never pushed through to process. She was the first person to tell me a confirmation number. She also said I would get an email confirmation within 24 hours, which I have not received. She told me I would have to wait 7 days from the 6th to get my refund because it never went through. That would be 17 days from when they originally messed up. As seeing I still currently do not have a confirmation email, I doubt I will have a refund by then. Do not book United, a mistake in their system and they told me they could do nothing about me having to rebook for more because it was technically their partner's flight. Even though I booked on United."
Dec 2019,30,Short journey tight for space,"This was part of a journey to London. Check in was straight forward, very quick and no issues.  I then found out the flight was delayed, this happened on my return journey as well.  It is a small plane and not much room for carry on luggage, so expect to check in any larger of these items."
Dec 2019,40,Good,Really scared about negative reviews  But we faced nothing negative  Checkin was smooth  Cabin crew great  We had a comfortable flight
Dec 2019,40,Comfortable flight,"I enjoyed this long flight, the service was very good and with lots of water was served. The staff were always available for any request given"
Dec 2019,10,Worst airline indeed,"Wanted to give -10000stars if I could.    We booked a flight weeks back that was best suitable for us, now they emailed us and tell us it’s changed for 12 hours earlier departure (this means the two of us would miss an additional whole day of work) and longer flight and layover duration, more stopovers. We don’t want to accept this stupid new itinerary , so we called to see if we have more options, for anything comparable to what we booked before, even though earlier departure and longer layover time we were going to say ok, but in the end they ask us to pay a large amount like 800+ dollars of “price difference” Since one leg is with another airline.    They also offered to refund us, this is stupid. They only refund the amount we paid at the time we book, the market price is so much more expensive for a flight from Toronto to Hong Kong now with any air line, and they don’t consider that.    By far the worst airline, never had this kind of issue before, just thought you should always get the flight u booked, but with UA it’s not."
Dec 2019,20,Mechanical failures,The flight was late into Houston due to a mechanical delay. Then had another delay at the gate. Arrived 30 mins late. Don’t believe the arrival and departure times the airlines post as they adjust them as they please. Arrive in Den late and ask about my next flight already boarding and they say the won’t hold it so I run across B and A terminals to reach the gate at closing to then be told they will hold the flight for 15 more minutes due to connections. It’s was more like 30. The airline has consistently broken equipment and their apps and staff are 30 mins behind what is actually happening. Run by high schoolers. I fly almost weekly.
Dec 2019,10,Never fly United again,"awful, entire flight changed did not get seat I paid, was cramped like a sardine, will never fly united again"
Dec 2019,10,"Lost Baggage for a week, rude customer service and absolutely no compassion for our time and inconvenience.","United airlines is the worst airlines in my honest opinion. Our story began the night before Thanksgiving, we were delayed out of Phoenix en route to San Francisco. We came to the realization that due to the delay we would miss our connector to Toronto. We asked to have our bag removed from the plane, which wasn't scheduled to leave for another hour, because we were able to switch to a Washington Dulles bound flight. 1st problem they would not retrieve our bag, only one bag we had checked, our daughters. So finally we arrived in Toronto only to be told our bag was in San Francisco. We were actually driving to Buffalo from Toronto, so we contacted United's main office and told them our dilemma. They assured us that they would transfer the bag to the Buffalo airport. For pickup that evening at 8:30 pm. I had a friend take me to the airport that evening only to be greeted by a very rude employee who told me that the bag was in Chicago and would be in Buffalo the next morning.The next morning we went back to the airport only to be told that the bag was enroute to Toronto. We explained that we were going to be in Buffalo for four more days and needed the bag to be shipped to Buffalo like they had promised. So after countless phone calls and empty promises and back and forth trips to the airport, interrupting our Thanksgiving holiday with family, our daughter was in tears and we had to go out and buy our daughter clothes because she had parties to attend, including a baby shower. We finally received the bag a week later back in Phoenix. We had already been back for a day. I retrieved the bag at the airport and it was returned busted, wheels broken. So disappointed in this airline and I will never travel with them again. Look elsewhere before booking with United Airlines."
Dec 2019,40,Good service back to US,"Our flight back to the states was better than our trip over from the states where we flew United from O'Hare to Munich on an older model that didn't have usb chargers. The flight from Geneva to Dulles was on a 767, which has fewer seats (2-3-2) and more legroom, I was very happy with the service."
Dec 2019,10,👎,Would not recommend flying with this airline. The service is atrocious. Fly American Airlines.  absolutely disgusting.
Dec 2019,40,"uneventful flight from Dallas, Texas to San Francisco","The flight was full but uneventful. Uneventful is a good thing, you want the flight to be smooth with no incidents. The flight attendants were very friendly and worked precisely."
Dec 2019,20,Virgin next time.,"Plane old, when dead when were ready to taxi out. Had to wait for 1.30 minutes to fix, no water airplane red hot, staff old. To much trouble to serve us. Spent more time in back. Coming back same again, couldn’t wait to dim lights."
Dec 2019,50,Great membership benefits,"I love that my Marriott Titanium membership gets me a free upgrade with United. I'm automatically United Silver when I link my two accounts and I can choose with each hotel stay and flight to either have them both count towards miles or hotel points. The airline is always dependable with no hidden fees that add up. They are constantly upgrading their vessels and the customer service is always very helpful. They have started to upgrade and offer different free snack options on most flights like this one I had a choice of either pretzels, cookies, or biscuits."
Dec 2019,40,Smooth flight,Being in the military United does a great job in helping us book flights and upgrading when available. The flight was smooth and enjoyable. The flight attendants were helpful and happy to help with anything you might need. Food was delicious. Recommend United airlines for all your traveling needs
Dec 2019,40,Large airline operator,Good airline and pretty large airline. good membership rewards service and have connectivity all across US.
Dec 2019,10,"Ryan Air, Jetstar and Tiger, step aside. United is the pits","Had to pay $95.00 for luggage. Said luggage left out in the rain resulting in wet clothes on unpacking.  A 6 hour flight with no food, no entertainment and grog at exhorbitant prices plus no overhead luggage because people escaping the rip-off luggage surcharge take it on-board with them."
Dec 2019,30,All flights on time with just a right amount of layover (not too long; not too tight),Economy so not much service; completely full tightly squeezed fleight but fortunately no crying baby nor screaming child. Entertainment selection poor.  Appreciated timely and efficient fleight schedules; better than other lines that I've experienced (delays; deletes/last minute cancellations).
Dec 2019,10,Cruel,"I am so frustrated and annoyed with United. Even when I was brought to tears in front of your staff, they act like senseless robots. I've been a loyal mileage member and United flyer for years, and I was denied boarding because I missed the check-in luggage by ONE minute. The gate wasn't even closed, boarding hasn't started yet. So when I passed through customs, I sat and watched everyone board the flight, and I just kept crying.    You're supposed to be one of the biggest and respected airlines in America but you act like a cheap budget airline with no heart and no empathy for their customers. Actually, the budget airlines I flew with in Europe like Ryanair and Easyjet would have more empathy for what happened today and would have let me on my flight.    Have some heart, United!"
Dec 2019,30,United Creates More Anxiety,"First, we were lucky that both flights occurred. The flight from Richmond to Houston is the only flight to Houston that United has. So if this flight is canceled, there is no other flight(even by another carrier) that will get you to Houston in time to catch the overnight flight from Buenos Aires. I have say that the Richmond to Houston & Houston to Buenos Aires flights were good. Richmond is such a small airport, United personnel are limited & the gate attendants are hustling passengers onto one flight & then they are off to hustle more passengers onto another flight. My annoyance w/ United is that I did self check-in & did not notice that our business seat assignments were changed & now we were not sitting together. NO ONE from United could fix this. Not the Richmond United staff, not the United reservations person on the phone( I was on hold for over an hour), not the Polaris customer service person, & not even the gate attendants in Houston. United blamed it on a plane change & said our seats did not exist anymore (which was not true). We were only lucky that another business passenger was kind enough to give up her aisle seat to sit in a window seat. Another passenger wouldn’t do it. We were on the same confirmation & it was as if the seat assignments were thrown up in the air & that how we were assigned. No effort on United’s part to fix this since it was fully booked. Also, Polaris business class is very tight. After flying w/ Cathay Pacific & AA Dreamliner business class, the business seats on United don’t measure up. I’ve been a loyal United traveler for over three decades, not anymore."
Dec 2019,30,International flight... 1st class...not worth it,"I was expecting on board screens for entertainment on an international flight. My arm rest was broken (stuck half open). The food was definitely not worth it. Other than getting on and off the plane first and the extra leg room, the extra cost was not worth it."
Dec 2019,40,About Time!,"I do most of my flying with United and it has been horrible for the last few years, but I feel it's getting better. This trip overseas was perfect. the service was great no delays, easing to get on and off the plane - no complaints for once. The people in first class really took care of us. The food can use a little wok, but overall I am pretty happy with them lately."
Dec 2019,30,Not a friendly Flight,"A very average two-hour and forty minutes flight to Denver, and another hour and a half to Billings, with two drawbacks: Carry-on bags were not allowed on board, and the flight service was unkind and sometime impatient."
Dec 2019,10,Delayed. Delayed..& more delayed!!!!!,The whole plant was sitting on the plant waiting for only one person for 57 minutes!!!!  Never fly UA again!!!!
Dec 2019,10,Unruly stewardess,"Flying Non revenues is checking your self respect at the door  I was flying w my bf who happens to be a pilot w this airline  I noticed the guy next to us  Got water food treats, etc  I went to the back to ask if I could have water  This is what I heard back “  You have no business coming back her to  Ask fir anything  You are a non Rex !!!!”  ThemL another attendant n  Another walked in  Laying in ! All  Yelling at me  I was in tears !  They then  WNt ttovether and filed a complaint to United that I was demanding !!!  They have told him  To  Apologize or no more buddy passes  Is this insane  These girls were like a prison team  No one tried to defuse  No one tried anything  They verbally attacked me  I never demand anyyithinh  But they got together and did this because they knew he was a Pilot  I will never fly them  Again  It’s back to  American fir me !.  A nightmare!!!’"
Dec 2019,40,Smooth trip to Aruba!,"Originally, I flew from San Francisco (flight 1255) and had a 45 minute layover in Newark. The flight from Newark to Aruba was 3 hours, but since it was a smooth trip it felt shorter. Since I booked in economy, the sits were a little tight to stretch my feet. The great thing about this flight was that it wasn't full, so I was able to more around a little more freely.    Once we landed and got out the airplane, we were greeted on the corridor with staff members handing out free bags with coupons. It was awesome and the luggage was dropped off fast. The airport itself is not that big, so it was easy to exit and find a taxi."
Dec 2019,10,Delayed 10xs,"Let me start with why do they NOT carry Sugar Free Ginger ale for their Diabetic passengers who also have motion sickness! Delayed at least 10 times, crew issues changed to weather issues so they didn’t have to give hotel vouchers. Someone finally told me about cots but then we’re rudely awakened at 4 am to get us out of the hallway. Other flights were found new crews."
Dec 2019,10,Flight rebooked missed everything,I was taking a flight from Omaha to Arizona. With an hour lay over in Denver. Flight from Omaha left 20 mins late. I got to the terminal 2 hrs early n plane I was flying on was sitting there. No clue why we waited so long to bored. As I got to Denver I was walking off the plane as my conecting flight was leaving. They sent me a message saying they rebooked me for a flight 10 hrs from then. I had to get to AZ at certain time otherwise I’d miss what I went for. They eventually canceled my flight n sent me back to Omaha w a refund. But my return flight was w American Airlines and I could not cancel that flight n get my money back. So I am out that money as well. As we were leaving Denver back to Omaha. We were starting un dock. Then the lady went on the intercom n advices us. That we were re dock n waiting for 20 mins on a flight that arrived late. Where was my 20 wait?
Dec 2019,50,Great flight to Beijing,"My daughter and I enjoyed this long flight, the service was great, lots of water was served. The best part was we had 3 seats to ourselves since the flight was not full. On the way out the plane was old but on the return we had a new aircraft."
Dec 2019,30,What's happening?,"What's happening to this airline? between the constant problems with the planes to the airline shutting down mid flight in the middle of the day, its becoming absurd. I used to be a loyal United patron, but now I find myself looking for any other airline. I really hope they go back to better planes and warmer sense of customer service."
Dec 2019,30,Meh,Meh about says it.  I don't know why all these airlines are doing away with in seat entertainment.  For some reason I immediately get pissed off when I pay an exorbitant amount of money for first class and get to stare at a sign telling me to use my personal device for in flight entertainment. Seats were not very comfortable could barely recline. Planes were old and outdated.  Would not fly United to Canada again.
Dec 2019,10,Dangerous and deadly like fire,"This is my flight from ORD to Shanghai, China nonstop. It was a Boeing 777-200ER! Something extremely dangerous and illegal I experienced is the flight skipping both meal services and the mid flight snack service due to turbulence. This was my most memorable flight ever!!!! When everyone no matter who talks about United, they will all be totally distracted from all of their jobs no matter what, so they will immediately get fired permanently. Everyone, Don't fly United no matter if it's urgent or not. There were only small small small small turbulences during this flights, but the flight attendant still made an announcement right after takeoff that both meal services and the midflight snack service will be skipped. Therefore, I was extremely (1000000000x) hungry after the 12-13 hour flight to Shanghai! I almost died during the flight because I was forced not to bring anything on board. The seatbelt sign was off the whole flight!!!!!!! This airline is the biggest catastrophe ever in the world!!!!!!!!!!! One more thing, United airlines is way worse than Frontier Airlines (the low cost carrier)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Dec 2019,40,Confortable flight,"The flight was comfortable. I had purchase the ""new"" category of ticket - no carry one, so I had to be in the airport in advance to drop off my luggage and had to wait in Phoenix (always the scary part) for my luggage. The handling of my luggage and the airport crew was perfect.  The flight was smooth and we got informed in a timely manner for potential delays due to weather. As I was almost boarded last one, there was no space on the overhead bins, so my laptop bag was on my feet."
Dec 2019,50,Great Service and very accommodating..,We had the round trip service over Thanksgiving and we were treated very well. We flew out on Thanksgiving Day and returned on Monday after the week end. Great service.
Dec 2019,40,So Much Better than other Recent Flights,"After having endured a couple of long haul flights on another airline, it was a relief to take this 3 hour flight in a little more comfort. While the seat sizes and legroom on all airlines are shrinking, the legroom on this flight was okay. Unfortunately, the passenger seated next to me was on the large size, and so the smaller seat size made things a little uncomfortable.    Although only drinks were served (for free) in the economy section, the selection was reasonable. I found it amusing that at the end of a three hour flight, they announced that they were coming through the cabin to collect any remaining items. Since they never collected any items previous to that, of course there were remaining items!"
Dec 2019,40,First Class Long-Haul Flight,"I've flown many long-haul flights on United (5+ already this year), usually in economy/economy plus. We decided to splurge this time and booked first-class, United Polaris lay-flat seats. The flight attendants were polite and attentive. I have a really hard time sleeping on flights and only had 3 hours of sleep the night before, so the lay-flat seats were great. They provided us with a regular pillow, small memory foam pillow, seat covering to lay on, a blanket (branded by Saks Fifth Avenue), and a toiletry set. The TV screens were also bigger and they provided headphones. We had 2 meals (breakfast & lunch) and a snack. The food was pretty decent but don't expect as extravagant of a presentation as you'd receive on international flights where some airlines even present you with a menu. Overall, I had a really good experience and it was the most rested I had felt on a long-haul flight since my neck wasn't sore from attempting to sleep sitting up and my legs & feet didn't swell up since I was able to stretch out."
Dec 2019,10,United Sucks,"The staff forced me to check my carry-on suitcase at the boarding gate. My suitcase is 500 dollars and united broke it last time. When I told them I don't want to check the suitcase because they asked me to check my suitcase at the boarding gate last time and they broke it, the staff threatened me if I don't check my suitcase they have the right to not let me aboard. They said there is no space for my suitcase, but after I am aboard, the rack above my seat was empty. They did not clean the seat at all and there was napkin with gum in it on my seat!!! United sucks!!!!"
Dec 2019,30,Couldn't upgrade and learned something new.,"The flight was ok as usual the only thing is that because I'm a United Mileage Plus Member and a United Credit Card Holder I booked a Basic Economy ticket because a few things that the basic economy doesn't offer I am eligible for because of being a Mileage Plus Member. I didn't know I wasn't able to upgrade though because of the basic economy ticket purchase, I tried to upgrade two seats from Denver to Jacksonville and I wast able to. A United employee told me that with the purchase of a basic economy ticket I wasn't able to purchase an upgrade. I thought this was very funny that a large Corporation was declining to make more money I thought they are profit driven and never had I encountered a situation where I wasn't able to make a purchase and spend more money. If you have long legs and are tall then I don't recommend the purchase of a basic economy ticket because your knees will be in the seat in front of you no leg room."
Dec 2019,10,Flight UA5458 worst passenger treatment ever,UA has sent me 21 text messages with the wrong flight information. Over 15 hour delay without a single person showing any concern for any passenger.
Dec 2019,10,Awful,"Considering we were first class and business first class, it was ridiculous that we were treated like crap The only perk was you got to sit on the plane first. wifi was non functional, not the nicest people either. waste of money"
Dec 2019,40,Airline of Preferance,comfortable clean attentive staff that were always available for any request given; good flight as captain informed with frequent updates--landings EXCELLENT; search for best deals with this airline and never disappointed
Dec 2019,40,Best Option for Direct Flights from IAD to Cancun!,"During the winter months I often try and escape away to warmer destinations for holiday. When flying out of Washington DC, I am always concerned about weather impacting my flights. I have found the direct flight from IAD to CUN on United to be the most reliable (and fastest) to get me to my tropical destination in Mexico."
Dec 2019,40,SFO to Honolul,"Long series of flights on United the whole way. Only issues were #1 a broken plane in Honolulu with a long delay at the gate. Flight was eventually cancelled and rescheduled for the next morning. United placed the entire plane load of passengers at the Ala Moana Hotel overnight, provided food vouchers and vouchers for taxi or Uber. Pretty good in my opinion."
Dec 2019,50,"Great lounge, nice staff","United has the larger seats, plugs and free tv...great staff both legs of the flight and they have a very nice lounge in Chicago where we had open bar, full hot breakfast, comfy seats to wait out our 5 hours."
Dec 2019,10,UNITED AIRLINES - THE SCUM OF THE EARTH,"How can I put this? I would not fly with UNITED even for free. These people do not know the meaning of the word ""COMPETENCE."" They only excel in a ""DON'T CARE"" ATTITUDE. Extremely rude and un-American!!! What have they ""united"" with? The scum of the Earth?"
Dec 2019,50,Well looked after,"Pleasantly surprised with United Airlines flight recently, efficient staff, excellent in flight entertainment with latest films and tv choices. All food and inflight drinks provided as well as earphones to watch the entertainment will definitely be using them again."
Dec 2019,50,Andrea Hicks is the best United Employee!,"Andrea Hicks gave me a a bandage out of her purse cause I had a cut up finger. She proceeded to bump me to first class when she had to obligation, and I had not asked for anything like that. Proud to be a mile plus member for an incredible airline who employs the best!"
Dec 2019,50,United to Dublin on Thanksgiving Day,"We actually flew in the Premium Plus section, after upgrading at the airport from Economy. The upgrade was well worth it. The seats were large and comfortable. I have seen a lot of negative reviews about the foot and leg rest. I thought it was very comfortable and I was traveling with a broken foot. The Star Wars amenities were a nice surprise and the on board service was excellent. Thanks United, for the safe and enjoyable experience! My only negative is, I would have enjoyed a turkey dinner :-)"
Dec 2019,20,Awful / Nightmare,"The weather was fine and we boarded the flight on time. However, we sat in the plane for 2.5 hours and then they informed there is a mechanical issue and we got off the plane. We sat around for 2 hours then they cancelled the flight. Flew us to San Francisco (6.5 hrs. vs. our initial 3 hrs. planned flight) for the evening. Next morning got onto the plane for final destination of Cabo San Lucas, MX. Sat on the runway for 45 minutes before returning to the gate. Maintenance issues this time. Finally took off and we arrived at Cabo Sunday evening vs. Saturday morning for our 7 day all inclusive vacation trip. Cost us about $400 because of food, cabs, etc. Totally disappointed with United Airlines."
Dec 2019,20,Last Part of Our Odyssey,"My husband and I eagerly awaited the boarding of our United Express flight from San Francisco to Tucson. This would be the final segment of our journey home from Seattle, which had started about 35 hours before. The time had been marked by mechanical problems in the air that required a return to Seattle along with ensuing cancelled and delayed flights plus an unexpected overnight stay at the San Francisco Airport. Even this flight was delayed for 30 minutes.    Boarding proved to be somewhat confusing because passengers headed to four flights at essentially the same time through one door. An extended walk took us outside and down a long ramp to the tarmac. Soon, ground reps checked tickets to ensure that passengers headed to the correct regional jets in the distance. We had not realized we would be outdoors and wore inappropriate attire for a cold drizzly night.    Most carryons were too big for the plane’s small overhead storage space and had to be left on a cart for storage in the hold before ascending the ramp into the plane. The 52 small seats were all Economy with limited legroom and little space below the bins. I noted that a few nearby passengers hit their heads on the bottom of the bins when standing later to leave the plane.    The seats proved to be in good condition and bearable for the 2-hour flight. The cabin seemed to be clean and well maintained. There was one toilet, located at the rear and extremely cramped. We had one flight attendant and he maintained a professional, friendly approach throughout the flight.    In Tucson, those of us with carryons in the hold formed a line at one side of the jetway and waited about 10 minutes for them to be delivered to our area. In keeping with this Thanksgiving Weekend odyssey, my bag was delivered last."
Dec 2019,20,Terrible Logistics at the Customer‘s Expense,"Average overseas flight but the domestic connection was delayed by five hours because of staffing issues. Plane was available but nobody to fly it. Customers who had paid for flights to arrive in time for dinner ended up compromising their health and safety on a red-eye flight arriving after midnight. They were compensated with 10$ meal vouchers, bottled water and junk food snacks. For my personal experience this meant 20 hours traveling- I would have made it home faster driving from Washington. Given that I have experienced such sagas many times with United, it seems to be part of the profitability strategy."
Dec 2019,10,Beware Change Fees!!,"My husband and I had originally booked a flight to Maui, but had a change in our itinerary and needed to fly into Honolulu instead. The itinerary we had booked had a layover in Honolulu, before proceeding to Maui. I called United’s customer service to see if we could change our flight to debark in Honolulu and not continue on to Maui. We were planning on checking luggage, so wanted to make sure our luggage also got off the plane in Honolulu. The customer service agent advised we would pay a $200 change fee for each ticket. She then put us on hold and when she came back on the line, advised that the change fees would be a total of over $400 each. This is more than the original flight cost!! Absolutely absurd considering the only change we were making to our itinerary was debarking early! We ended up just booking a replacement flight with Delta for half the cost. I will never fly United again!"
Dec 2019,40,Uneventful flight,"There isn't really a Business class no matter what they say for this domestic flight. We paid for the Exit row which was quite good. No meal served. Friendly-enough staff. Safe, uneventful flight."
Dec 2019,20,United to Amsterdam,"Lackluster service, outdated planes, slow boarding, rotten food. Any of the European airlines or Delta is a better choice. I’ve flown worse (Air Italia), but not often."
Dec 2019,40,Good Flight,"Good check in, efficient services in flight. A reasonable meal served after an hour or so and a light meal before landing. A few drinks opportunities - tea coffee soft drinks, wine beer - all complimentary. A couple of pretzel snacks offered too. Toilet facilities okay. Good range of screen entertainments including a good range of films and tv shows. It was exactly as I had expected. There were a few spare seats so we were able to spread out and this was a bonus.  (on the return flight the woman in front of me put her seat as far back as she could - so the TV screen was in my face! Yes - seats should recline a little, but not that far!"
Dec 2019,40,All Very Good,"Neat and clean plane, pleasant service both boarding and during the flight, very good communication by cockpit and flight attendants to the customers, timely unloading of luggage.    Overall very good and would recommend to others."
Dec 2019,40,Updates are great!,"We traveled Economy so we did expect the small legroom and slightly uncomfortable seats. What we didn't expect was the great customer service or the Houston United terminal with his tech chargers and great seating. The Flagstaff, AZ airport staff were exceptional!"
Dec 2019,50,An alternative to Coach,"United Business class to Aruba was a very pleasant way to spend 4.5 hours in the air. Flight attendants were friendly but not over attentive. It is odd the a vegetarian meal selection is not offered at online check in...that was a disappointment. Otherwise, we’ll continue to use UA’s Business product."
Dec 2019,40,Ho Hum Flight,This Ho Hum flight was just what anyone would want. We needed to get to MN for Thanksgiving with family and friends. It left on time got in a little early. No fuss no muss and absolutely no drama. Which is just what you want when flying during a holiday week.
Dec 2019,10,Terrible customer communication,"I tried to check in online like every other airline allows, but was not able to. I didn't have check luggage, they just have poor customer care. I arrived at the small town airport 40mins before the flight and I was told I could no longer check in, along with 5 other people. I asked if the fight was full, it was not. 40 mins later I heard the announcement for the flight boarding. It's totally non sensical for a small town airport to have such strict rules. I had to wait 12 hours to get another flight."
Dec 2019,40,I used United since it was the only airline that fit my time requirements,"It was okay! I have been flying for business and pleasure for many years. Flying is not what it used to be. On my flight, the WiFi was not working."
Dec 2019,50,Awesome plane ride,The only way to fly from the east coast to the west coast is on United 787 Dreamliner plane. The plane is so comfortable and even sitting in economy was very nice. We fly to Paris in this plane and fell in love with it. Great job United. You are always my go to airline.
Dec 2019,10,why does this airline consistently struggle with basic customer service at some airports,"I dreaded the thought of a 12-hour flight but the flight itself and attendants were fine. checking my bags was a complete nightmare. although there was 4 customer service supposedly there to check bags one was JUST dealing with the premium customers, another for additional services leaving two to the deal with baggage drop for over 400 passengers. One of the two was out of commission the majority for the invariable United screw up, LEAVING ONE attendant for the majority of the passengers. There was no from United managing the process even when the line grew snaked out of the baggage ticket area and far past the area. Unbelievable."
Dec 2019,10,I would never recommend United Airlines,"1. The seats in one plane, it was a Boeing 737 traveling from Seattle to Houston, was extremely small, I barely fit, my knees were almost touching the front seat and I couldn't stretch my legs (I'm 5'9"") and it could barely recline, it was a horrible experience.    2. On my was back to Seattle, the plane had NO entertainment at all, no TV, no screens, no nothing for a FIVE hour flight! I didn't even know that commercial planes with no entertainment still were in circulation.    3. International flights are supposed to not charge for your first bag, it seems that the ""high season"" was starting that day and we found out at the counter so my wife and I had to pay for one bag each when we could've consolidated all in one if something or someone would've let us known with time. (This trip was from El Salvador to Houston, we didn't get charged on our way to ES, as its supposed to be)"
Dec 2019,10,Never ceases to negatively surprise me,Can’t remember last time I had an on time flight with them. Yet even worse customer service & baggage rules. Will think twice about booking another flight with moving forwards
Dec 2019,50,Bought the Economy plus,It’s worth every penny to get the upgraded seat. You can pick your seats and there is more leg room which is worth it.
Dec 2019,10,world trip,"well airports at beijing bangkok chiang mai phuket singapore and airlines air china scooter etc all so much better as far as airports. ,airlines, facilities. After trip felt the usa and newark was a 3rd world country vs visa versa"
Dec 2019,30,Mostly Uneventful,"We had a very uneventful flight. Boarding was easy and the crew for both flights was very nice. The gate crew was just as nice.    Our flight home was a different story. Our first flight out of Punta Cana was a breeze and the crew was great.    When we landed in Newark, we had issues. The plane to Cleveland was delayed an hour due to high winds...not a big deal, it would give us time to clear customs and grab something to eat. We found a place, sat down and ordered drinks and food, with about an hour until we are scheduled to board the plane. Not long after our drinks a food arrived, we got a notification that our plane was no longer delayed and boarding was starting. We had to box the food and leave most of our drinks. We were not that far from the gate but we rushed over to start boarding.    The plane was not ready to board and we sat another 10-15 minutes before the process began. Once the process started, they went quickly and got everyone on...so quickly that the luggage had not finished being loaded. We sat even longer waiting for that process to finish. After we pushed back, more waiting, now past the delayed time.    In the air, the crew was okay, but it was a short flight and there was not much attention needed."
Dec 2019,10,Fly Alaska Airlines and save yourself the headache!!!!,Our flight was cancelled and re-booked for the previous day! We can't travel in time! Then when we called to get booked for the correct day they re-booked us again for the wrong dates! We ended up having to drive 3 hours to a larger airport to even get a flight home and then they just cancelled our entire trip home. We ended up on Alaska airlines who was amazing and service was 5 stars!! To top it off they broke our baby stroller so we had to carry the carseat and baby while pushing a stroller and are not willing to pay for the damages.
Dec 2019,40,LAX-ORD,LAX-ORD Flight was on time and crew was friendly. Wish that the Clear in ORD was available. Overall was a enjoyable trip
Dec 2019,20,Terrible check in/client service,"No problems with the flight, bu dad an awful experience on our last flight to Puerto Vallarta. The check-in process turned out to be a torture, i was told my Green Card wouldn't be accepted in Mexico and i couldn't fly at all, i would understand if i was told that before when i booked the flight, when i was the airport with resort booked, tours planned and family waiting is the worst way to handle the situation.    I think a big company should have a clear policy about this kind of thing.    One kind woman called - which i won't revel the name - help me and explained the whole situation and after analyzing my situation she issued my boarding pass and guess what? NO PROBLEMS AT ALL in Mexico.    Unfortunately i had to fly with this uncertainty of not being able to enter the country and it was all in vain. Again, no problem with their rules, as long as they advise us so we can be prepared, but no i was told right away ""Oh no you can go!""    My experience in'st terrible just for this one person who was kind and understanding."
Dec 2019,10,Race to the Bottom,"If you want the cattle experience, fly United. The worst experience to date from DEN to DSM. They will lie that weather is causing delays (not a cloud in the sky, not wind either in Denver or in the location the plane is coming from. Just admit you are disorganised). Changed my gate 3 times in the space of an hour (20 gates in between the last 2 changes). The stewards acted like Nazis. No warmth, just mechanical, dehumanising interactions. Couldn't keep track of their messages or what they said to us. Ignored the Captain's warnings about turbulence (nobody needs their coke no ice at 2am if the 200lbs cart will end up in their lap Karen), at which moment he told them to sit in their seats. People don't fly United for the customer service, the timely flights, they fly because they're the cheapest at busy times. I think United is in a race to the bottom. A cargo plane would have been a better experience."
Dec 2019,10,Self,Worst service ever!!!!!  Will never use this airline again!!!!Horrible service  Unfriendly staff!!!  Not helpful at all
Dec 2019,30,An Average flight,"The flights were on time. The planes were clean. The attendants were professional. The leg room was minimal, though."
Dec 2019,50,flights from Baton Rouge - United is the best way to go,"I love going via Houston instead of Dallas because that airport is so much easier to negotiate. I find that Dallas has more cancellations because of bad weather. BTR has no direct flights to the west coast so to avoid going to the that nightmare in New Orleans I alway try to fly out of Baton Rouge. United is the best option, in my opinion"
Dec 2019,30,Disappointed,"My experience with United is generally positive and therefore on this flight, I was disappointed. Everything about it was average except for the seat which was not clean. For business class, I was especially disappointed"
Dec 2019,10,Waste of time,"If you want to wait for staff members to show up for there scheduled trip and sit through delays , after delays.... every time you change planes... than you should be accommodated on united airlines. If you want to miss you connecting flight .... if you want to listen to excuse after excuse of why it is not united airlines fault for correcting they're client services, delayed flights united airlines is for you . I have flown on multiple different airlines and never experienced such horrid client services . They are no willing to take responsibility for added stress and anxiety of schedule delays, do not offer to compensate for their faults and are rude in person . I will never fly united again . Such a horrible experience."
Dec 2019,30,Avoid Economy tickets,If you are planning to fly United do yourself a favor and avoid economy tickets unless you are ok with all the limitations. My girlfriend and I recently travelled on United and we purchased the economy tickets for a quick get away. We should have read the fine print. You can’t select your seats. You can’t upgrade if you decided to at the airport. You get no carryon so we ended paying extra $60 for two checked bags. You will be seated randomly most likely in the back of the plane. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra $$$ for regular tickets that gives you options.
Dec 2019,50,Good service; terrible weather delays,I was pleasantly surprised at the service on United. The main problem was the lengthy delays we experienced. These were related to weather in other parts of the country which effected our flights. We spent about 4 hours in the Houston airport and missed most of the opeing evening of the conference we were attending. But the airlines kept us updating us. They even gave us snacks...nice touch after 3 hours.
Dec 2019,10,The worst experience with United yet.,"We purchased a round-trip ticket a month in advanced for us to take a break to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving, with my wife and my 11 year old daughter. Came time to fly out of Denver... Bad Weather, but technical problems with the plane. Took 2 hours for them to fix the plane and take off finally after midnight. We didn't feel safe after the second delay message... so we purchased a ticket with another airline and flew to LAS at our own cost. That airline had no problems and was on time... (Frontier). I don't think it was a bad decision to think about my family's safety. I just didn't inform United I was doing this... this was my mistake... only if I knew ahead of time, that you have to tell them if you aren't going to use one of their ""rotten"" tickets.  Once came time to fly back from Las Vegas... we went to the airport 3 hours ahead of time to check in and relax before the flight.  They said that since you didn't use the first ticket, your whole itinerary was void. So the $800 tickets we purchased to use for the one-way to Denver was worthless? I din't even know there was such a rule... it's not written in any of the documents we read when purchasing... and I've never done this before. I just didn't feel safe with the multiple delays. I'm sure they sold our seats to someone else after we didn't use them... so they made 2-3 times their money back already.  After waiting for a long time we were directed to the manager C. Yoshida... this person had such a bad attitude, she acted like we stole something from them... she acted like we were criminals... she treated us with no respect at all. After directing us to her podium, with gestures, not words, and then leaving us there for about 10 minutes, with no warning... she went to some people sitting across the hall to talk with them... and when she came back she flat out said your tickets are worthless and I'm not going to help. They probably already sold our seats to someone else for the LAS trip and maybe this trip... so they already made money on the one way we didn't use... now that we want to use the other direction to Denver... she says, that they are worthless. She said, call United, see what they can do for you... I knew no one would answer so... With lots of pleading, and us asking for a supervisor, she finally called her supervisor. The supervisor granted our tickets to fly back to Denver right away. I could hear her trying to convince the supervisor to nullify our ticket and make us purchase another one. This person had a very nasty streak. Once she came back to us she said, that ""she (her supervisor) granted your request to reinstate the tickets, but I wouldn't have done it"". I don't know what prompts another human being to be so nasty to another one, without even knowing them or their situation.  I wanted to find out if she had a bad day or something, just so I could understand her mean steak... but right away she said, ""it's done, she accepted and I'm doing it"" so we should just cool our personal question. All I asked was ""are you having a bad day?"" I think it would have made it easier to grasp if I knew she had a bad day to begin with and she was taking it out on us. I didn't want to escalate things at this point, so from there on, it was ""yes madam"", ""No madam""  Before all this, we went to the ticket counted and asked why we couldn't check in at the computers... and it seems like no one at that airport (LAS / United airlines) likes their jobs... because they are ALL rude and give you one word answers. very poor customer service at the ticket counters... I think maybe they were all told that they were fired after the day or something like that, so they just didn't care about serving anyone in a respectful manner.    I hope I won't have to deal with anyone in LAS / United, in the future... I'm definitely going to try to avoid United in Las Vegas for future trips. I will definitely try to go with another airline even if it costs more."
Dec 2019,40,Hawai’i Bound,The flight was delayed almost 2 hours because the original plane had problems and United had to bring in a new plane.Got to admit the new plane was nice and the crew very nice.
Dec 2019,10,Bad experience and even worse customer service,Everything regarding my flight was bad due to one united employee. I’ve been trying for a month to speak to someone from United. I called multiple times and left a email on their feedback email. They have made no attempt to contact me. Would rather fly anyone but United.
Dec 2019,50,Vacation Nightmare Relief,"United Airlines made our return home after a vacation nightmare a pleasure. My husband became ill on a cruise and we were disembarked in Puerto Vallarta. Getting him back in the states was a nightmare. Then we spent 9 days in a hospital in San Diego. Finally released to fly home. We chose United Airlines. From the curb at San Diego to arriving in Medford, we were treated with compassion and humor. First class on short hops consists of larger seats, more leg room and your refreshment in an actual glass glass. Regardless, the flight crew made the two hops (San Diego/LA and LA/ Medford) very enjoyable. As we had come aboard in wheelchairs they asked about our story. They helped us get seats together and made sure we were very comfortable. As we were getting ready to land in Medford our attendant told the plane that a Vietnam Vet who had been having a rough time was aboard and Dan got a wonderful round of applause. After the previous two weeks we felt we were finally home."
Dec 2019,10,Sig.ra,@unitedairlines #unitedairlines  Obliged to leave my baggage claiming full. There was Place in the overhead above my seat  Very rude impolite and mannerless on ground hostesses    Neve e fligh United
Dec 2019,50,Flight UA1039,The flight was a little ahead of schedule and that worked well for me.  Also the flight attendant were very professional and attentive to the passengers.
Dec 2019,30,Good value for the price.,"My wife and I purchased tickets to go LA for a weekend getaway and decided to try the economy tickets; since pricing was so much cheaper than other classes of tickets. I would recommend this option to anyone looking to save a couple dollars on transportation. However, there are a few contingencies that may make these tickets less desirable for some travelers. 1. You cannot select your seat, so sit anywhere they have open, 2. Cannot being a carry-on bag with you, and 3. Probably the most confusing is that you cannot upgrade seats at the time of the flight. For this you would have to pay $60 or so for the seat ahead of time to be “allowed” to upgrade if seats are open at the time of the flight. While I understood ahead of time that I could not upgrade the tickets to other seats, I still find it to be rather odd that if I am willing to give you more money to upgrade at the time of the flight, that I am told I am unable too."
Dec 2019,40,Vacation time,"My fiancée and I recently went on holidays in los Cabo , Mexico, unfortunately we had a lay over in Denver . I was surprised how easy and convenient united made the transition from plane to plane for us . We did the same trip home with another airline that was not able to match the service received from united airlines . Thanks for the safe and pleasant transportation to los Cabo and we will be flying with united airlines again . On a side note , I paid for better leg room in our seats and they sold me emergency row seating for 52$ usd extra , for a seat that doesn’t recline and comes with responsibility if emergency? I wasn’t aware of this but it should not be an extra charge ,..."
Dec 2019,50,Polaris comfort,"It was a long haul flight and I did t want anything but comfort and a good night’s sleep. Food was great, I got the halibut but I should’ve opted for the rib, hmm. Attendants in our area were good. Snacks readily available at the galley. Seat was great, Star Wars themed announcements and kits were cool, had intermittent sleep but mainly because of body adjusting. There we lots of movies to choose from, and WiFi starts at 12.99 to 30+ usd. Overall I really recommend United Polaris!"
Dec 2019,50,RoundTrip NonStop LA London Was Great,"Our trip was on time. Check in was easy and we don't check luggage as we just use carry on. Staff and food was super. Each leg of 10-11 hour trip included two meals, one heavy snack like a small sandwich, and one or two lite snacks like peanuts. This even included free beer and wine and we were in economy class but we don't drink. (met family in London from Canada and they were very disappointed in their country's airline with only one meal on long flight). When not serving food, crew even walked down up and down offering glasses of water. All the crew was professional and very nice."
Dec 2019,30,Avoidable 1.5 Hour Delay,"Everyone was onboard and ready to depart and the captain announces there will be a delay: ""The plane hasn't been refueled yet?"" Really, it was sitting on the tarmac for several hours and they hadn't gotten to it yet.    More announcements:  The left wing is filled, won't be long now  Problem getting nozzle into right wing  Maintenance being called  Maintenance here, problem with the valve  Valve fixed, refueling has begun  Refueling completed, we'll be departing shortly  Another delay, maintenance has to document the problem and get the repair signed off. Should be another 30 minutes or so.  OK, we're ready to go.    Unacceptable ground crew performance."
Dec 2019,20,Challenging,"Flight UA6046 was the most challenging flight of my travel career. It boiled down to this: two very young (maybe 21) stewardesses who did not control the clients. Announcements were so fast they could not be understood! Before takeoff a young couple with a baby and toddler were jockeying for the best seats. They took an exit row and I felt that they couldn’t manage themselves speak nothing of the needs of an aircraft emergency exit. The mother and toddler walked up and down the narrow aisle throughout the flight to entertain the child, even when fasten seatbelt signs were in. They were a huge safety hazard and disruption; screamed narcissistically the whole trip. They blocked the aisle when we tried to depart because they’d left luggage at seats in the rear. Needless to say, it was a tough flight I wouldn’t care to repeat due to safety concerns. Baggage pickup also took about forty five minutes. United has been a favorite airline and I know they can do better. Perhaps a little retraining. Thank you."
Dec 2019,50,GREAT PILOT and CREW,"I usually dread my cross continental flights. This one was flawless! Checking assistance at the kiosk in Sacramento was complicated due to baggage changes and WENDY was an amazing kind help. Onboard, TERESSA was beautifully groomed, poised and so kind—she was a standout among crew. The Direct TV provided a good selection and made the time fly. Take off and landing were flawless and I thanked our pilot for the smooth flight. I would repeat this connection in a heartbeat. Thank you United."
Dec 2019,30,late plane,"we were coming home from santa fe new mexico on an american air, we changed to united to get a 4 hour layover in denver,crazy right to want a 4 hour layover,,but we wanted to see the city and a friend was on that flight and said with that time we could go into denver and have lunch, well our plane did not arrive on time in santa fe so that meant we would not have enough time to leave the airport,,we were very disappointed..when we arrived our friend was kind enough to get us passes to the presidents club,,so at least we could relax and get some food and drinks.the flight price was excelent though it was less than $200 for the entire flight from santa fe to newark so that was nice"
Dec 2019,10,The most uncomfortable seats in the industry,I don’t understand how it is legal for United to pack you into a plane with no leg room at all. You can’t open the tray because the seats are so close together. The discomfort Is intense. The staff is great but I will never fly United ever again because of those seats.
Dec 2019,10,horrible,horrible. flights get delayed 3 hours. staff are horrible. flight is horrible. united sucks. don’t fly united.
Nov 2019,10,Terrible Customer Service,"We had given up flying United because of the terrible service we received in the past but we decided to give them a try since they had a new flight convenient for flying our kid home from college. The customer service has been awful. Flight was cancelled due to weather. Took hours to get someone on the phone who it turn gave my daughter incorrect information. United won’t stand by their mistake costing us $100’s. Last time ever!!! Alaska has been a much, much better carrier. Guess who our kid is flying for Christmas break."
Nov 2019,10,"Still often late, not much improvement over the years","My parents stopped flying United years ago because of consistent delays (both in departure times and additional issues at the gate, wouldn't be surprised if one causes the other) compared to other airlines. I decided to try my luck now and see if things have improved. Not at all."
Nov 2019,10,Bad service,Bad experience overall. Over 14 hours late in my travel with them. Choose another company. Not much concern that I was delaide on three flights in one day.
Nov 2019,50,Excellent care during a medical emergency,"I had a medical emergency while on thus flight, and the crew went above and beyond to help me the rest of the flight, even after I recovered. They even gave travel vouchers to the physician and other medical personnel who were caring for me as a thank you to them, which I really appreciated. Once I recovered enough to return to my seat, they checked on me every few minutes to see if I needed anything and to see how I was doing for the last few hours. They also offered to walk with me to baggage claim and find me a physician after landing. Couldn’t have asked for better service!"
Nov 2019,50,Felica Was Wonderful!,"I had an absolutely wonderful flight, where Felica S. was the purser. She was really wonderful, very friendly, professional, and attentive to all of the passengers. She simply made the flight experience wonderful, and I am truly appreciative!"
Nov 2019,40,Good flights/pilots but no direct flight,"I have to compliment the pilots, from Jackson to Houston to San Antonio. The flights were pretty smooth for the most part, even though we hit weather coming into SA. But the landings were perfect. The big disappointments are: the fact that there is no direct flights, so a layover is necessary and therefore there’s no such thing as a $49 flight EVER. They charge for baggage which now has created a huge problem because just about everyone in the flight now brings an over stuffed carry-on bag, clogging the aisle, slowing the boarding time to a screeching halt. Miserable. The prices at the airports are criminal... four dollars for a granola bar, eight dollars for a three ounce bag of dried apples, eleven dollars for a shot of liqueur. The lady in front of me got a 3.8 ounce jar of never-opened Nutella confiscated... pure insanity. She was going to make sandwiches for her kids. Like a woman with kids to feed is going to blow up an airplane with Nutella. Ridiculous. I hate how stupid the “security” is at the airport. Hate."
Nov 2019,20,Below average service,"This particular leg of the air journey saw below average service. Started right from the boarding gate. Flight departed and arrived on time, luggage arrived at the belt in good time as well, which were the only positive experiences."
Nov 2019,50,"Great flight, everything was great!",Flew straight into Shreveport. Attendants were great and I was on time and on my way! Price was very low.
Nov 2019,40,Beautiful,I found this to be a great experience. My only complaint is I had to pay to check a bag. Why?🤷🏽‍♀️
Nov 2019,10,Expect to wait..,The delays and staff are unbelievable. Waited up to 5 hours just to be told there’s no captain for the aircraft. Very irritating when trying to plan. .5/5
Nov 2019,10,Worst Experience Ever!,"If I could give 0 stars I would because my experience with United is not a good one. For one I’ve never flown United before and this was definitely my last time. I flew from Cabo to Houston with United and we were stuck on the plane for 2 hours with no information on why we were not taking off until the pilot came on and said “we had to fix a mechanical issue, don’t worry these planes break down all the time and we just have to roll with it”. Then I get to Houston where I had to run to my next flight and was by Unite Stuart that hopefully our bags will make the plane , no guarantee. Then we are on the plane to Houston and yet another mechanical issue and another 45 mins sit on the plane. Then finally make it to my destination and finally find my luggage after 45 mins of waiting because they had to unload another plane before ours, I walk up to find my luggage completely torn apart and my makeup and straightener just thrown onto the conveyor belt. Then I walked up to the United airline area to talk to someone and I was completely dismissed and the lady was very rude to me, I told her that my luggage did not look like this before I left Houston so it happened on the way there. She stated she could give me a $100 flying pass and I told her I was never flying United ever again.  I then begin to tell her how two pairs of my shoes were missing and I pair of sandals, she stated that I could go buy them, then bring the receipts back to the airport and get my money back, which absolutely makes no sense to me.  Safe to say I will never fly United ever again, and I really hope this happens to no one."
Nov 2019,20,Don't forget about the secret baggage fees,Yes it looks like a cheap flight until you add the baggage fees which doubled the cost of the flight
Nov 2019,40,conference trip in november,Flight left on-time. The plane was clean. The flight attendant was friendly. I am a fan of the cookie snack provided as it goes well with coffee.
Nov 2019,40,conference trip in November 2019,The quick flight was on-time for about 7 AM departure. There had been a snow storm a day and a half earlier and the airline seemed to have recovered from delays and cancellation in good order.
Nov 2019,20,Lack of Space!,"Not only was there not enough leg room in my seating area, I only allowed to bring one personal item in the cabin with me! And to make matters worse I was charged $30 to check my bags!  If my employer hadn’t booked the flight I would have flown Southwest Airlines. They allow a carry on bag in addition to the personal item and don’t charge for bags.  The only positive thing is I got to my destination in a timely manner."
Nov 2019,40,Better Trip from Previous Experiences,"Due to fog and a short connection, we ended up running in the Houston terminal and didn't think we would make this flight. We were one of the last customers aboard but assumed our luggage wouldn't make it. We were pleasantly surprised and all our luggage made it as well. The flight went well, no issues and the flight stewards were friendly enough. The internet was not available (go-go in flight) once we departed the USA and food / entertainment was available for an additional charge. As we had three bags, it cost an additional 220.00 to get the three bags on the flight. Again, a no frills flight...everything is an additional cost....but no issues as it got us from point A to point B."
Nov 2019,30,It is what it is,"The two most important things to me are the plane being on time and clean, especially on an international flight. Switched to Rough operated by Canadian air in Toronto. Both flights were on time and the planes were clean. The 767 is getting old and the seats are on the small side."
Nov 2019,20,Not really freindley,"The screens at the checkin were not so clear. Had to do it a second time for my bagage. I had to pay an extra 30 US dollars.  With my boarding pass and bagage I went to drop off. Just before me they closed one point. Now there was only one point open and the one for priority. So no drop of open. After more than 10 minutes the people were ready. So I thought I could drop off my bagage. WRONG, the UA personal stopped me and a second point for check in priority was opened. More than 5 minutes after my complainment, a dropp of was opened. So in total I waited more then 15 minutes to dropp off my bagage."
Nov 2019,10,Delay boarding for over 40 minutes with no weather conditions or any conditions at all.,"United airlines is absolute worst for international travel, stay away if you want a pleasant flight."
Nov 2019,50,stand united with united!,"This was my last flight segment, from my long travels from australia, so I wanted everything to go fast and smooth as possible! The various customer service agents were spectacular with helping passengers get their bags rechecked and headed in the right direction to their gates! The gate agents were very well organized and professional, during the boarding process. i use to be a ramp manager for many years and watched the ramp agents, from the boarding area window. They ran the operation like a text book in all areas. They even provided perfect work safety protocol throughout the turn to prevent employ injuries and make sure that the aircraft and equipment were not damaged. This included getting my bag loaded to the correct destination, which has been a nemesis with my travels. The entire flight crew did a great job, as well. I was amazed that one of their female flight attendants just wore a blue and black outfit that did not say united on it at all? She had no ID, nor any airport or work badges on, in the process. I figured that this was a lack of supervision issue and had no affect on the flight performance. The flight cockpit crew was very safety oriented by telling everyone that it is going to be rough turbulence after the first 30 minutes. Therefore, he has the flight attendants do a quick beverage service in the beginning and put the fasten seat belt light on, when the flight got bumpy. It was thanksgiving evening, so it was nice to get home on time, after traveling so far!"
Nov 2019,10,Opposite of Military friendly,"I wish I could give negative stars. My husband and my flight needed to be changed due to military change of orders for our wedding. After numerous calls to agents in different countries where I explained in detail was occurred, they sent me online to submit. Then, they denied my refund request even with the appropriate documentation they requested. I have had awful flights with them before (rude staff, delayed flights due to their scheduling issues, poor service) but this is the icing on the cake. Shame on you all. I will walk before taking another United flight."
Nov 2019,10,United Airlines,2.5 hours between connecting flights and United still couldn’t get us there — missed our connecting by 10 minutes. Put us up in a dumpy Red Lion hotel 30 minutes from the airport for an 8 am flight. Sucks!
Nov 2019,50,"Fast, fast, fast flight","The plane was scheduled to leave John Wayne Airport at 10:30am, but was delayed until12:00pm. I was afraid that I would miss my connection in San Francisco, but the plane got us there in 50 minutes! I had time to spare!  I couldn't believe that an airplane could travel that fast. Kudos to the pilot and crew!"
Nov 2019,10,Do NOT FLY UNITED,"Worst flying experience I have ever had, specially on a special day, the reason I booked this trip To Dubai to celebrate my birthday, but instead, I’m making phone calls, getting frustrated and being tossed around different departments trying to receive compensation for the lost time, delay, experience, and losing a moment of my life because this stupid flight delay ruined everything. On my Birthday to be exact, I had plans to enjoy the city and have a wonderful dinner, the fact I was already alone on my birthday. Makes it even sadder is when the cause of the airline to ruin your trip has been nothing but a nightmare to deal with because of their lack of resolution and problem solving. The expense I have to make calling internationally and being charged a night I wasn’t staying at my hotel because my flight delayed is on the head of every customer representative and management of United. I’m beyond, beyond frustrated and infuriated by this delay of handling my matter. NEVER FLY UNITED."
Nov 2019,20,No carry on bags in economy,Poor customer service by gate agents & low value for the cost you pay for the flight. I have been meaning to write this review to warn other passengers about this airline. You are required to purchase upgraded tickets that are very expensive to be allowed a carry on bag. This is not competitive with other airlines
Nov 2019,50,"""Extremely friendly Flight Attendants!""","Was on an overnight trip and was pleasantly surprised how nice and friendly both FA's were. Very attentive to passengers needs and frequently returned to make sure we were all taken care of.  This was a United Express flight and I love that there are no middle seats, just 2 and 2."
Nov 2019,50,Outstanding Customer Service,"Another routine short morning flight or so I thought. My husband and I had boarded the 737 plane in Seattle, taken our comfortable seats in the well-maintained First Class cabin and enjoyed glasses of refreshing water before takeoff. Boarding had been quick and orderly and our flight attendant was professional and cordial. We departed on time and the pilot soon made an announcement that he expected our San Francisco arrival to occur half an hour ahead of schedule.    His next announcement, however, meant that there would be no early arrival. The plane’s landing gear was down and refused to retract. For safety reasons, we were turning around and returning to Seattle. The pilot continued to make updates in a confident, calm matter. Our flight attendant reinforced those comments.    On the ground again, the estimated time to make repairs would be at least two hours and we would miss our connecting flight to Tucson. Many passengers sprinted to Customer Service to rebook. We opted to go to the United Club, to which we belong, for assistance from a United rep there. She found a nonstop flight to Tucson on another airline and arranged for our United checked luggage to be retrieved and taken to that airline.    All the employees we interacted with during this situation were extremely professional, helpful and friendly. Though we knew our Tucson arrival would be much later than anticipated on our first flight of the day, we felt well looked after. I fly often on United and am quick to write about bad service and other drawbacks I encounter. Today, I can give nothing less than a standing ovation."
Nov 2019,30,Average carrier,"It is a Star Alliance partner and therefore, it has codeshare with Air India. However, facilities in International business class flights are poorer than any other Star Alliance partner including the Air India. The services like food, etc are also very average what to compare with top airlines. There is hardly any /very little difference between first/business and economy class facilities. Most strangely, there is no United Club/lounge at Mexico, which is very unusual for such a big international airport terminal. The language is biggest challenge. Even at the counter of United Airline, its own staff are not conversant in English."
Nov 2019,40,Picked good seats!,"I selected the last two seats on the right, 51A and 51B for our direct flight to Honolulu from Chicago. Neither my fiancé or I have ever flown this far, so we really had no idea what to expect. Packed extra snacks, our electronics, downloaded the United app and settled in. All in all the flight wasn’t that bad, the seats were perfect. No one behind us, lots of leg room and room to walk around. Flight staff was attentive and personable.    The only draw back was our flight was delayed by 2 hours taking off. We had already boarded, so our 9.5 hour time frame on the plane turned into over 11 hours. That was tough.    Selected the same seats for the flight home. Worked out great again and we arrived back 30 minutes early. Yay!!    Would go direct again and in these same seats!"
Nov 2019,20,United is One of the Worst,"Only fly UA because it's the dominant airline in Newark. 8 of 10 times when I fly UA there's always something going on that my flight is delayed. Overall, UA lacks good customer service. Most of the UA flight attendants don't even seem to enjoy working on the planes. When I fly internationally, I try NOT to fly UA but airlines like Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines. Service, food, terminals, and aircraft are much better. And the airline has the arrogance to offer video entertainment using your own devices."
Nov 2019,30,Fairly comfortable and timely flight with plenty of communication issues.,"Flight was comfortable, food was horrible, service was good. Initially flight from Newark to Buenos Aires was cancelled without notice to all passengers. Flight then went through Houston nearly tripling travel time. Customer service was stingy with accommodation related to this inconvenience which occurred because of its business decision to cancel a direct flight from Newark."
Nov 2019,10,Worst flight of my life,I travelled on a United Airlines flight as part of my around the world trip of a lifetime.  I was sat 6 rows from my companion yet the seats were chosen at the time of booking. My seat was in the middle of the middle bank of seats. I had man on one side who stank of alcohol and promptly went to sleep. The woman on my other side took a sleeping pill and also slept.  The seat in front was reclined but my seat was broken and would not. That meant the little screen was about a foot away from my face and focusing on it was difficult.  For the entire flight I got one biscuit and 3 glasses of water. At no time were we told that there was no meal service. In fact the early PA said there was going to be a breakfast service when we approached New York. That apparently was an error.  The crew member closest to my seat ignored me when I tried to get her attention.  Even on short domestic flights we are served something to eat in New Zealand. On this flight which was the longest in our entire itinerary we got nothing.  By the time I got to my hotel I was feeling weak and shaky as it was over 14 hours since my last light meal.  Overall I was very unhappy with this flight. It was a flight from hell.  I will never fly United Airlines again.  If you get the choice do not fly this sub-standard airline.
Nov 2019,10,First class service lacking,"We wanted our trip to Hawaii to be special so spent the extra money on first class tickets 4400.00. Our return flight was an overnight flight so we were hoping to be pampered. We had been in airports for 26 hours by the time we got home. From OGG to LAX we didn’t even get a hot towel. From LAX to DEN the guy behind us had something wrong with his seat cushion. He decided to place the cushion so it was blocking our seats. When we asked him to move it so we could get into our seats he got hostile. The flight attendant was right behind us, we were in the first row, but she didn’t intervene. Instead she yelled at us for not stowing our carry on baggage quickly enough. We couldn’t even sit down. Won’t ever fly United again."
Nov 2019,50,United Airlines Is Furry Approved!! Along with Southwest,"As a traveling ‘Furry’ - When I fly with my fursuit in tow, I have to depend on an airline that will get me to a furry convention with minimal stops. Our “Number 1” reviewer in Redondo Beach chooses Alaska Airlines. Sadly, I can’t depend on Alaska as their network is full of gaping holes like Swiss Cheese. United fills the gap with a dependable schedule that gets me to cons like FWA and MFM with relative ease. Also, their network with Star Alliance allows me to go on other carriers and receive premier benefits. I have their MileagePlus VISA card, which allows me free check-in luggage bag, to tow my fursuit while carry-on allows me to take my fursuit head on board. I choose United, with Southwest as backup for ANY Furry!!! FIVE CLAWS UP!!!!! Thanks for reading my review of United “Fly The Friendly Skies”. Your Number 3 reviewer in Redondo Beach - Joe G. Bear"
Nov 2019,30,No amenities,Flew from Las Vegas to Newark today in first class. Had the lay flat seat. When I asked for a pillow and blanket they didn't have any on the plane.  The breakfast was an egg and ham crescent. What was offered was a ham and cheese crescent. I can't eat eggs. There was 1 thin slice of Canadian bacon on the crescent.
Nov 2019,50,Great flight,We were totally impressed with comfort and pleasant service of this United Flight. Our only complaint was that they forgot one of our vegan dinners but they rounded one up
Nov 2019,50,My Favourite Airline,I usually take a stop over and worry about my bags reaching the final destination. It has always been on time and connections are smooth. Love the airline.
Nov 2019,50,Nice space,"Nice space we sat in 18 a first row ecvonomy  Very attentive Crew  Food was bad, really bad.  Free beverage."
Nov 2019,30,An exercise it wondering!!,Early morning flight. Flight delayed because of weather. The Airline was not forth coming with information regarding the status of flight. Each time we asked we got a different version of what was happening. When we finally left Newark we knew that we would not get to San Francisco to board our ship!!!
Nov 2019,50,Customers First!,"As always, every staff person at the United Airlines counter in Las Americas International Airport is an ambassador for the company, and they place their customers as their first priority. Helping with luggage, airport directions, security cautions, efficiency, and so much more makes their attention to every detail appreciated by those of us traveling."
Nov 2019,50,on time with NO bag fees for United credit card holders,no bag fees makes a big differance to which airline I fly. I always look at United first because of the luggage savings.
Nov 2019,50,Comfortable transatlantic flight on United Premium Economy,"For a summer 2019 trip to France, I happened upon the New Premium Economy section that was sold for a few dollars less than the Economy Class, roundtrip ! As many of you know, summer airfare tends to be very high. An off-season SFO-CDG transatlantic flight triples in cost during this peak season. I got lucky finding this summer airfare on this new premium for less than $1,000. For the CDG destination, premium economy was only offered on the first leg to FRA, and then regular economy applied in the regional Lufthansa flight to CDG.  My friend and I took the bulkhead seats, allowing us to stand and stretch during the long-haul. With the extra 3ft of empty space in front of us, we didn’t mind the inconvenience of putting our purses in the bins for takeoff and landing (a small crossbody bag of extra pockets help keep a few personal items close by). The seats were behind the first class section and away from the bathrooms.  As shown on the photos, the food was definitely more appetizing and palatable, not served in a box. The extra seat width, attentive service, and added amenities made resting much more comfortable through the flight. The same sentiments applied to the return flight.  I usually do not fly United, but will definitely do so in their premium economy section at the right to price!"
Nov 2019,20,Indifferent to physical limitations,I broke my foot while on a business conference and traveled back with my son for support. We were met with total indifference from everybody at this airline. Once the wheelchair service dropped me at the door of the airplane nobody could care less. Very uncomfortable flight for somebody with limitations. I did the previos segment with Delta and their behavior was friendly and caring. Besides United now behaves as a cheap airline while charging for everything so it ends up being more expensive
Nov 2019,20,not the best experience,horrible flight...seats too close ...restrooms needed attention...one of the stews had an attitude...foood and beverage service slow
Nov 2019,10,Despite early check in was not allocated seating next to my partner,"We recently took a quick trip to the US. On the flight from Sydney to LAX the flight was empty, my partner and I had a row of 3 seats to ourselves, plenty of other singles were able to spread out on 3 seats and get some shut eye. When we checked into our return flight we were allocated middle seats in adjoining rows. We (mistakenly) thought this flight must also be empty and would each be allocated a whole row. What a mistake, on boarding the flight was full and my partner and I were seated in the middle seat of adjoining rows. I questioned why, if the airline knew that the flight was full or even if that was uncertain that they would allocate a couple travelling together different seats. Unfortunately none of the adjoining singles offered to switch spots. I had the added bonus of the passenger to my left (remember I'm in the middle seat) telling me I was infringing on his side of the arm rest. While not a frequent flyer, we have travelled overseas many times previously, I still can't understand why they wouldn't seat us together as the logical fall back. The food was average, the bread on a turkey roll served as a mid meal on both flights was stale as were the rolls served with dinner. Attitude from the stewardess when asking to change seats did not help."
Nov 2019,50,United Airlines flight from Chicago to Anchorage,United are a wonderful airline who look after there patrons with A1 care and attention. Seating was spacious and comfortable and it was a great flight
Nov 2019,10,Making people check purses as luggage?,"Just watched gate agents make a lady check her purse. It was a normal tote style business purse, very slim. Half the thickness allowed, in fact. But it was 1 inch too high (11 inches) and they charged her $55 to check it AS LUGGAGE and it doesn't even have a zipper on it so how will her stuff stay in it? It was the only thing she had on her, except for her coat!"
Nov 2019,40,"United ""Lie-Flat"" Seats from IAH to Honolulu","These seats are comfortable and great for sleeping, if that's your aim. They also have a nice sized screen for watching movies, TV shows or other items available with a remote control device next to you, without having to deal with the ""personal entertainment"" system on some other UA flights that may or may not work properly. Trying to get a proper answer from customer service is impossible, they only suggest downloading the newest app (how much newer can you get when you download the app the same morning). The meals and drinks are nice. My only caution is if you're sitting in an inside (not on the aisle) seat, you may have issues getting up and down to the bathrooms or just to stretch on long flights. This would occur when the outside (aisle) person declines into a full sleeping position blocking your easy exit/entry. Unless your able to climb over or straddle the person (not likely unless you're 7' tall) you'd have to awaken them and have them return to a seated position in order for you to exit and enter the aisle. Thanks United, for the powered seats and electrical outlets."
Nov 2019,40,Pleasant flight,"We had two long flights, both were on time which is always a plus. Staff seemed to be under pressure serving food and beverages. If you ask for anything between snack times they are not so obliging. Basic but guess you get what you pay for."
Nov 2019,50,First time to fly United,"I was very pleased with all aspects of flight to Bangkok on United Airlines. Boarding went seamlessly and there was plenty of overhead storage even though we were in the final row of the airplane. Seats were as comfortable as economy seats can be and the last row of seats did recline.  The flight attendants are what made this United such a success though. They were attentive, pleasant, and very professional. Every detail was taken care of and done professionally and with courtesy. Every time I got up to stretch my legs on the flight one of the attendants asked if they could help with anything.  We were both very pleased with everything about United Airlines and their staff. We will definitely flight United again."
Nov 2019,30,Not too good for long flights,"Good point is the staff, really nice, friendly and helpful on board.  The food is ok, considering that we are on a plane.  But the plane was definitely not good for the category of international flight, small seats, other airlines companies in economy either have more space. Also, the air-conditioning was automatic, so you could not choose to have it on or off from AMS to Houston.  From Houston to Liberia, a bit better but is is a flight of around 3hours.  They should review the planes are using for intercontinental flights."
Nov 2019,50,Mexico Flight,"What you would expect on a flight. Our connecting in Chicago was late, but that was ok as it gave us a little more time. It was not a problem as I'd rather have my connecting run a little behind as to the flight coming in running late. Other than that kind and polite flight staff as you would expect."
Nov 2019,50,Great Flight,First class service in First Class. Comfy seats. Surprisingly good food. Friendly service. On time departure and arrival.
Nov 2019,40,United does the best they can for premium economy passengers,"I needed to get to Toulouse, France, for business. Since there was no direct flight, my United flight took me to Frankfurt. I only had 50 minutes to get to my connecting flight to Toulouse; so, I was grateful that my flight arrived in Frankfurt on time.    I was seated in an exit row; so, the extra legroom was fantastic!    The flight attendants were kind and helpful. Since I had hurt my leg a few days before the flight, the ground crew let me board early. The flight was smooth, as was the landing - the cockpit, cabin, and ground crews of United were all professional and did their respective jobs with expertise.    Flying for over 11 hours is tiring. It is nice to have such professionalism."
Nov 2019,30,Where do we put our shoulders?,"The staff and crew were fabulous but those 4 middle seats on the 777-200 were a torture. 4 full grown men were in the seats and we had to negotiate a peace treaty to get our shoulders to stop colliding. We agreed that the left shoulders would lean forward so the other person's right shoulders could fit behind the other person's left like interleaving sheets of lumber. And this was premium economy. We had nice monitors on the seat back in front of us and the controls were on TOP of the arm rest so that if one of you rested your arm there, the channels would change at a rapid rate. flying through all of them. Well at leat it was a 737 Max."
Nov 2019,50,PERFECT,"Although in tourists the space on long flights is always low, United has those extra centimeters that allow you to breathe. The attention of the onboard staff great. I will definitely repeat company."
Nov 2019,10,"United Saved Me $3,723","...by making the booking so painful that I decided not to fly! Went to United.com to book a round trip for two from Houston, TX to Iquitos, Peru. Total cost was $3,723. After entering my payment information I got an error message saying they could not process my request and I should try again or call customer service. So, I tried again and got the same error message. I called customer service. They directed me to go back and try some different payment options, which I did, but got the same result. Then the agent started looking at specifics of the various fare classes. All she could tell me was that she could not offer the fare that was on the website. After more than 30 minutes of looking at various options, she put me on hold and then hung up on me. I called back and talked to Emily. She tried the same things, and got the same result. After almost an hour on the phone, she was able to come up with the option of booking each leg separately, but could only book the United half (the other half was a partner airline). She said she would waive the customer service call fees (that's right...they charge you $25 per call even if it's their fault). I told her to go ahead and make the reservation, and I would contact the partner airline myself to make the other leg. I never got a satisfactory response as to why the could not offer the price offered on their website. Anyway, when I went back to pay for the reservation she had made the $50 for the two customer service calls WERE on the bill. So I called a third time to cancel the reservation!"
Nov 2019,50,Airplanes fly me to where I want to go!,"I've been a passenger on the airlines for over 45 years. Things have changed in that time, however, I have no complaints and I always try to have a sense of humor and gratitude. Airlines get me from point A to B. Seats are narrow (no matter what airline) and always full- which is good for any airline. My recent United flights were just fine- all but one (one stop over each way) left exactly on time- and that is always my main concern. The one delayed flight could not be helped and United was very accommodating.- the issue was very quickly resolved (we had to switch planes). So, yes, I'd fly United again. Entire Flight crew was always very informative and professional."
Nov 2019,40,Straight Connection from CDG to SFO,"This is a good connection to get straight to SFO from CDG Terminal 1. Terminal 1 can easily be reached from several central locations down town via the LEBus.  One thing to know is that Terminal 1 does not offer a lot of shopping or food options once you pass security. So, shop, or go to the lounge before entering security.  Boarding was confusing for some people because another flight to EWR is scheduled within 1/2 hour of the SFO flight.  The flight itself was uneventful in a fairly new Boeing 787. Two meals were served plus a mid flight snack. United provides ample entertainment choices adn USB hook-up in the seat back in front of you. It helped to have Economy Plus, with more leg room."
Nov 2019,30,Missed all our connections,"We booked our flight 8 months in advance because we had to book our hotel early as well. A few months later we received an email telling us our flight was no longer available and could only leave 3 days later then we were staying. No so bad to have to stay in the South Pacific 3 more days so we were able to book a longer stay in our hotel. When departing Tahiti, a couple on the plane before we left got sick and had to taken to the hospital. We left 20 min late. Not so bad as we had enough time to still catch our connection. But, when we landed another plane was in our gate and we had to wait in our plane for over a half an hour. Needless to say, by the time we got offf and collected our luggage most of our plane missed their connections. United was able to get us on another aircraft but only to YVR. It was up to us to find a flight home to YLW. On a good note, we were on the 787 Dreamliner and loved the plane."
Nov 2019,50,United Airlines,"What a wonderful airline United Airlines are, firstly at San Fransisco International Airport we went to the United Airlines lounge, rated number 1 in the world , and we could see why. Initially greeted by the staff at the lounge area to have a delightful shower and rest before being taken to the wonderful resteraunt. Great food sensational service, it got us ready for our home bound flight.  We were welcomed on board got our United pyjamas , very comfortable a welcome aboard champagne, and the food and service were again exemplary. The convertible seat bed was very comfortable and in flight movies were sensational.  I would thoroughly recommend this airline to everybody as there product, staff and planes were sensational."
Nov 2019,50,Perfect,"The experience was perfect from beginning to end. Short line to check in, flight boarded on time. We landed 30 mins early and there was a gate. Easy customs in Chicago. Perfect. What it should be"
Nov 2019,40,Good comfortable reclining seats even in Economy,Had a comfortable journey. Seats were comfortable with good reclining. Had a good choice of entertainment. Overall a pleasant experience. I was dreading the long flight but didn't realize the duration. Landed before I got restless. The only thing that I would recommend is a leg rest. If there was a leg rest that would have been more comfortable.
Nov 2019,50,Cabo to LA,I hadn't flown united in awhile. Very nice seats with streaming movies and tv. Nice thing to have! The checkin and going thru customs at Uniteds terminal was pretty easy.
Nov 2019,40,Good Flight,"Was coming home from Las Vegas, flight was full, everything went very smooth. The flight crew were very courteous and helpful."
Nov 2019,50,Great customer service,United was very accommodating by changing my flight time from 6:30pm on to 10:00 am so that I could go home at an earlier time. The flight was very comfortable and u enjoyed the short stop in Denver CO.
Nov 2019,50,Great flight,"I'm still on vacation but taking time to write a review because of the fabulous customer service we received on this flight. It was flight 1065 and our flight attendant, Allison, was amazing. She made us feel so welcomed from start to finish. She was attentive in a way that made us feel like we were her top priority- though I know she makes everyone feel that. Thanks for the comfortable journey!"
Nov 2019,40,Flight staff was very helpful and kind,"The flight staff was kind and helpful. Our flight was delayed for about 3 hours (we had to wait on the plane), the flight attendants were very sorry, and tried to make the wait as comfortable as possible. The seats were relatively comfortable, but the food was very bad. Overall a good experience, and will be flying with them again for international flights."
Nov 2019,40,"Good timely flight, great service",We flew from Manchester to Newark in October 2019. Outbound flight was slightly delayed but we made up the time and the same on the way back. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Drinks service was plentiful and food was good. In-flight entertainment had a huge selection. I would fly with them again.
Nov 2019,30,Not bad,"If travelling from Houston to Tuscon, United Express has direct flights. These flights tend to be smaller commuter planes, which I happen to like. The plane interior was clean and new, and the trip was relatively fast. There is not a lot of legroom in economy, so if you are tall, I would upgrade out of economy."
Nov 2019,20,Beware of Basic Economy and Costumer Service,"I purchased a basic economy ticket and misunderstood the terms of the purchase. Basically, I had too many bags to carry on and the attendants at the check-in kiosk would not approve my check-in without two of the three small bags being checked. Unfortunately, my backpack and my overnight bag were both bags that would not completely close. They both had button clasps, and therefore if I put them on the belt as was I would most likely lose the contents inside. My purse had a zipper, but was not big enough to consolidate the other two bags . I asked what my options were, and the attendant and her supervisor told me the only option was to purchase another ticket that was not basic economy. I threw a bit of tantrum, as that option seemed ridiculous and I was in a rush to make my flight... I mean, my bags were so small that they could've all fit underneath the seat! To buy another ticket seemed outrageous. On top of that, they told me that the ticketing desk could not help me and that I would have to get out of line and call the reservation number.    Once I got out of line it dawned on me that all I really needed was a trash liner so I could wrap my bags up and ensure that nothing would fall out while they were being handled. I frantically scurried around the airport in search of a janitor who could provide me a trash liner. I had no luck with that, so then I started scouting all of the trash cans to see if I could find a new liner that had not been used - still no luck. Then I went to a restaurant outside of security and begged the cook to give me a trash bag. She treated me as if I was begging for spare change and said, ""you can have just one""... I said, ""great!"", grabbed the bag, stuffed my things inside, and headed back to the ticketing kiosk. By the time I returned, the two lady attendants who had been completely unhelpful were gone. I stepped in line to get my bag tag and another attendant spotted the trash bag in my hand. She asked what was inside. I told her that I did not understand the rules around basic economy and had prepared baggage that was not suitable to check and went on to explain that I had wrapped my bags in trash liners for assurance that my things would not be lost. She smiled kindly, took my bag and tag, went behind the counter and grabbed a big, nice, thick plastic United bag and wrapped my things in another layer of security, saying that she would take care of it for me. She was so nice and let me get on my way in a jiffy.    But wait! Why didn't the two lady attendants that I initially spoke to present this option of using a United plastic bag beforehand?? Why did it take me thirty minutes running around the airport in search of a trash liner when United had bags behind the counter the entire time. It really ticked me off that the two women who had initially raised my stress and anxiety levels with their short, unhelpful responses had not mentioned beforehand that United had plastic bags!! This unpleasantry could have all been avoided if the United staff had been more equipped to troubleshoot such a seemingly simple problem. Instead, I guess they thought it was amusing to push me into an hysterical rant and scare me into purchasing an additional ticket. Oh, and did I mention I'm very pregnant? The increased hormone levels did not help this situation AT ALL."
Nov 2019,20,"IF YOU NEED WHEELCHAIR ASSISTANCE, DO NOT TAKE UNITED TO VANCOUVER","It was an 8 - 10 hour trip. After a flight I get very dizzy and can fall. The world spins.  There were wheelchairs on all legs of this trip except for my arrival in Vancouver.    The SA agent at the door of the plane (who was responsible for the service) shouted at me several times, each time louder and louder: ""You have to wait"". I am not deaf, just dizzy and wobbly. So I am stood holding up others wobbling and swaying. There are no grab-bars, no empty wheelchairs to sit on while I waited, no one to assist -- except this little lady who is shouting at me. Yes, finally, I shouted back.    I have been trying to alert United, but no one wants to take responsibility:  (1)I am advised that each airlines is responsible for the wheelchair service.  (2) But twice I filled out an online complaint form for United Airlines and twice - it disappeared. Just, it just disappeared.  (3) I phoned UA and spoke to a manin the concerns dept but he advised that I could not leave a verbal complaint -- and directed me to the magic online form. The one that disappears.    It appears that it will take a law suit before United Airlines takes responsibility."
Nov 2019,30,On time but minimal on-board service,"The good news is that we left and arrived on time. Also, the in-flight entertainment worked, with a large selection of movies but mostly quite old. But in-flight service was minimal. The flight attendants came by once to offer a beverage and we never saw them again on this almost 4 hour flight. Never returned to pick up trash or offer another beverage. They had run out of some of the buy-on-board meals by the time they got to us in row 12--poor planning for a dinner-time flight. Usually I get some acknowledgement as a United elite (1K) flyer, but not on this flight."
Nov 2019,30,Lost luggage,"I booked a flight on Air Canada to Calgary, then from Calgary to San Francisco via United, and from San Francisco to Burbank also via United. Unfortunately, the Air Canada flight from Vancouver to Calgary ran into technical issues and was one hour late leaving the gate. That meant that I was going to miss my connection in Calgary. That didn't bother me because I had missed connections before, and I felt that getting stressed over it wouldn't do me any good anyway. When I arrived in Calgary I was greeted by a United staff member who told me to check my phone for my boarding pass and that I had to hurry because I was now going to Denver instead of San Francisco. Wrong instructions! I should have gone to get my baggage and retrieved it first, then gone through American immigration with them, then dropped them on the baggage belt for connections. I was told to speak with an Air Canada staff member, and she called United to correct the problem. They gave me a letter to give to immigration, and I proceeded to my gate for Denver. When I arrived in Burbank at 8:30 PM there was no one from United at the airport and my luggage did not arrive. Having no one to complain to, and I did try. I even called the airport information who announced on the loud speaker that a United employee was needed, and I waited until 9:30 PM for some to arrive, and nothing. I ended up having to go to WalMart to try to find ""business"" clothes for the next day. And when I finally got to my hotel at midnight and called United, the employee had the courage to ask me why I didn't complain to the personnel on the ground. My luggage arrived in Burbank the next day, Monday morning, apparently it had been stuck in San Francisco. But it only got to Whittier, where I was staying, on Tuesday night. It took two days to get from Burbank to Whittier. Meanwhile I was badly dressed going to work for two days in my WalMart clothes. I still don't know if they will be refunding my expenses. United is not an airline I will be recommending to anyone anytime soon."
Nov 2019,50,Fantastic flight,"It was convenient, comfortable, good service, and nice staff.  Airplane was huge and fully equipped. Thank you."
Nov 2019,40,"Flight to London, much nicer on a dreamliner","One way trip, a little over 9 hours. Wife can't stand long flights, I had no problem. Lot's of movie choices on seat back. One 3.5 audio jack, no double adapter needed. USB port on seatback to charge or view jpg's. I wish it had the ability to load codec drivers and watch mp4's from thumb drive (no need for tablet of phone at that point)! Power outlet in between seats also. Lot's of empty seats going over there, but full coming back."
Nov 2019,40,Easy flight,"I had no issues with the flight, it went pretty quickly and the staff was nice. This plane didn't have a tv screen to watch movies which is a bummer since I was expecting it would but otherwise flight went well!"
Nov 2019,50,Boarding easy from LAX,"Fly the morning hours, crew is great! Enjoyed boarding this flight and great breakfast. Flight was smooth."
Nov 2019,40,Flight and attendants great!,"The flight was great! Was a bit delayed in EWR. Sadly my carry on was placed with general luggage. I realized there was no need for this because I saw people put thicker/bigger carry ons and there was actually open spaces in overhead bins. After my carry on was shipped with regular luggage, others were allowed to bring into cabin their bags. Frustrating! Overall, flight attendants gave great service. Our pilot was a female and most of the FA and two males (that I saw). Pilot did a great job getting us to LAX. Weather in LA great too."
Nov 2019,30,On Time would be nice,"I booked a round trip from Newark to Austin. Unfortunately, both flights were delayed over in hour -- the first due to mechanical issues, the second due to weather. While I was waiting at the Austin Airport, another plane that had been delayed 5 hours due to mechanical issues took off. United, you should do a better job maintaining your planes."
Nov 2019,10,Bad customer service,Company policy says it allows for carry on. When I arrived to airport. They made me check my bag because they said economy ticket doesn’t allow for carryon they also charged me for it and we’re very rude at DFW. It was a lady with long brown hair working at checkin. I didn’t get her name. Beware that they won’t allow you a carryon despite the fact that it says they will.
Nov 2019,50,Wonderful Recovery,"After a very stressful and headache in trying to get us back home due to misconnections due to a mechanical issue, United was able to rebook us the next day. Took over 2 hours to resolve but United was determined to resolve all issues.    As a very loyal 1K member; I truly appreciate all your efforts. Thank you"
Nov 2019,50,Great flight.,We had a direct flight. We left about 30 minutes late but we arrived before our planned arrival time. The onboard agents were very helpful and friendly. Food was good and we got plenty of drinks. Yes the space is tight but this is economy.
Nov 2019,40,Excellent flight San Antonio to Dulles,"Excellent flight from San Antonio. Left on time, arrived slightly early. Smooth flight, the meal was good as was the wine. Service was excellent, seat comfortable and the bagged came very quickly. Only problem no movie which isn't great for a 3 1/2 hour flight."
Nov 2019,10,World traveler,"United is horrible and only getting worse. In the last ten years that I have been traveling all over the world, (literally for oil and gas) I only see United caring less and less about schedule and comfort of the passengers. Any airline seems to treat their employees and passengers better."
Nov 2019,30,LAX to Cancun,"Flew with airline from Los Angeles to Cancun on the 5 November, having flown with this airline from LAX to Melbourne (AU) last year thought that this would be a good pick as our international flight was great, Check in as usual was rushed which is something common in the U.S, boarded the plane and found that this was not what we expected for an international flight (should have done my research), although this is only a five hour flight. Found the seating to be a bit limited and leg room not great, the cabin crew were very attentive to customers, for me I would next time to take premium economy or travel with an airline that has all the added entertainment and service. We travelled across with Air New Zealand and stayed at the Sheraton overnight to break the trip, we did not do this last year and were exhausted from the International flight (United) to LAX then connecting flight to Florida.    The flight was ok to Cancun with a no frills airline"
Nov 2019,40,OK,"Flight from COS to Houston was early. The ride was bumpy, but that's to be expected.  The return flight was delayed (mechanical problems) and we went to 3 different gates to get the flight. We only got in one hour late. NO big deal."
Nov 2019,50,Hong Kong trip,Recently went on a trip to Hong Kong and this is the second time I’ve flown United. Normally I go through JAL but because a friend flies often and goes through United I went with him. Tickets were a little higher but the main reason I go with United is the lounge is exceptional especially in Japan. With a four hour layover that lounge is awesome it has showers and great food it cost $50 if you’re not a member But they have showers and the food is restaurant quality and free beer if you’re into that so it’s well worth the $50 I highly recommend it
Nov 2019,40,Business class to Cancun,"I booked a last minute trip to Cancun and found that Business class tickets were only about $100 more than coach so I figured I’d try it out. Because it was an international trip, we got to use the lounge. It was a nice experience, getting free drinks. Not a huge variety of food, but it was decent.    The flight itself was fine. Plenty of leg room but the seats themselves were not very comfortable. This was a red eye flight so I was hoping to sleep. I had a hard time getting comfortable. I think I slept better on the way back in economy on Interjet!    We landed about 15 minutes early. We went through immigration, got our bags, and were curbside at the time our flight was supposed to land!    Overall a good experience and well worth the extra cost of the ticket."
Nov 2019,50,NIce flight,Flew from San Francisco to Narita Airport in Japan. The flight crew were extremely nice and friendly. The seats in economy seem to be further apart than other airlines I fly.
Nov 2019,30,newark to Las Vegas,good flight. easy efficient check-in with precheck-in. The usual too small seats. Everything went smoothly.
Nov 2019,50,Great flight to Oahu,"The United Flights were great going and coming back from Sioux Falls to Oahu. By flying through Denver, we limited our lay overs and had excellent connections. I have the United Club Card which allowed us access to the Clubs and put us in Boarding group 2.    The option of the Basic Economy does not allow you to choose a seat until you board. They also limit you carry-on to a purse or briefcase. Not worth the 50 dollars you save when flying long distances."
Nov 2019,10,Never again.,"There is absolutely NO leg room on United planes and barely any elbow room. To make matters even better I was privileged enough to share my arm rest with a dog which had been taken out of it's underseat carrier as soon as we took off.  Gets even better, male steward then proceeded to oooh and aaah petting it while serving beverages without ever washing hands.  Kids can't take peanut butter to school because of allergies but dogs are fine about anywhere.  Listening to a barking dog in the airport as I type this."
Nov 2019,40,Always treated well on United,"Our first flight was delayed long enough that we missed our connection but United texted us that we were booked on the next flight. When we arrived in Houston we just went up and got seats assigned. We were also traveling with 4 others and it looked like we were all going to be on different flights into orlando. Then a brilliant, customer-focused agent got all of us on that next flight! This is one of the reasons we fly United as our first choice. They understand customer service!!!"
Nov 2019,10,"Once again, no luggage on arrival","Flew from Charlotte, NC thru Newark. There were issues in Newark with our gate assignment so we sat in United lot for over 30minutes waiting for our gate to open up and then there was no ground crew to guide us in. Another wait. Consequently our bags were left in Newark. We then flew to St. Maarten and we're switched over to Winair. We were unaware our bags were not with us and not transferred. When we arrived in Curacao we were told our bags were in St. Maarten and would arrive the next morning. I checked my United app and learned they never left Newark. After 2 hours on phone with United baggage control in India we have no resolution and United says they are not able to do anything until Winair contacts them. Our ""form"" that Winair filled out was a scratch paper with bag numbers and our name. Nothing formal, no case number given. Will be at least three days before my dive year and clothing arrives. Never United!"
Nov 2019,50,here in nj we love united!,"we love united always on time ok food stewards very nice. has there own wheelchair people . aircraft look new, provide some amenitioes  even the reps on the phone are nice. giving you options and more direct flights  they do feed you on international flights more then once"
Nov 2019,50,Two great flights,"Flew from Den to MFR and back. Both flights were smooth and the flight back we flew into inclement weather, but the pilot did a fantastic job. The return flight was delayed, and the two people at the gate desk, Nicole and Curt, were very, very nice and treated everyone with friendliness , a big smile and were very competent. They even thanked me for my military service, which I really appreciate."
Nov 2019,20,Customer is always wrong,"It was bad enough that we were facing a 9 1/2 hour flight but as soon as they got everyone onto the plane they then told us there was a problem with the plane so we sat onn the ground for 90 minutes while they ""fixed"" it. As we all know, the seats are getting smaller and closer together, one can not even put their head down on the smaller table anymore without hitting the seat in front of them. When they came around to feed us, all the hot meals were already gone and we were just about 1/3 the way back in the plane. We ended up paying $10 each for 4 pieces of cheese and 4 crackers. They are also back to pouring you a small glass of drink instead of giving you the can. The ultimate insult anymore is they no longer show movies unless you have a smartphone, which I do not. So I spent 11 hours staring at the back of a seat. Did I mention my daughters luggage did not make the flight, it was delivered the following day. No confort, no hot food, no entertainment, no luggage. What happened to the airlines. It is obvious they know you have no or little choice so just shut up and bear it. Finally, I'd like to add, this discomfort has occurred in several of my recent flights, this was not a one off."
Nov 2019,40,Service is not consistent,"The full meal service is great. Great selection of entrees and drinks. The small meal/ snack towards the end of the flight is not as good. I got the Mac and cheese and it’s all dried out and tasteless. Lots of movies and TV shows available, but only from US. No movies from other countries."
Nov 2019,30,Disappointing.,"First of all it did not take off on time. 23:10 was the departure time and it departed at 01:20. And the airline did not even send an update on the schedule.  Next, my flight was straight from mumbai to Newark, and Newark to Honolulu. But instead it flew to Munich-Newark-los Angeles- Honolulu. It was an extremely long journey.  They didn’t even give toothpaste and toothbrush, eye cover and earbuds. Food was not fresh. first flight was ten hour long and the toilets were not clean."
Nov 2019,40,Trip to Singapore,All flights departed on time. Flight attendants were very attentive for most of the fight. Business class was very comfortable. Could use more movies to select from. The food was adequate.
Nov 2019,10,Flight,"I was looking forward to my flight , upgraded my seat to premium economy but was charged for baggage"
Nov 2019,50,First Time Phoenix,"We had a great flight over from Houston to Phoenix.    My first time visiting the state.    Honestly, the plane’s interior was alarmingly low ceilinged and tight with the full flight.    I was seated at the rear, against the bathroom wall.    I was not sure how this would be, but I think I may have found my new favorite seat.    Due to back issues an aisle seat is a must for me.    So being able to get up and down whenever the flight allowed and have easy access to the restroom was a win win.    This way, I was able to stay hydrated and not worry about either climbing over a sleeping passenger and was able to assess when the restroom was available.    This was perfect for a longer (2 hrs 40 ish minutes) but not long flight.    The steward on duty was extremely nice and pleasant.    I had checked my bag, although it met carry on standards, so did not have to struggle with the overhead bins. Shocked at how many brought their carry in bags. The bins were definitely full.    We had access to free movies, which helped pass the time. Free headphones provided.    Surprisingly this was not the case on the return flight.    All in all, very satisfied with this United Trip."
Nov 2019,40,trip to Italy,We had an awesome flight to Rome Italy and then back to DC for another week. No delays No problems just on time service or better. Meals were good and flight was as comfortable as could be for that long period of time. Only complaint is trying to sleep in such an upright position is not fun. wish seating reclined a little bit more so that a pillow is more conducive to sleep position.
Nov 2019,20,Flying Premium on UNited from Newark to Israel,"The bathrooms were filthy. The seat was very comfortable, much more so than my husbands which was in economy plus. A found the flight crew invisible at best and when there rude. Flying premium one is supposed to get and upgraded meal and drinks. I was served an economy meal which I found totally uneatable (I only eat kosher and usually the kosher meals while not gourmet are ok). I find the meals out of the US usually far worse than the meals out of Israel. Have you guys thought of getting a cooking lesson from Turkish airlines (another Star Alliance airline) or Swiss (there you even get a closed bottle of kosher wine)."
Nov 2019,10,The worst airline there is,"I’ve dealt with this airline before and had a horrific experience, and have heard nothing but negative from people who have flown with them. I unfortunately put in a situation to have to book with them. Costumer service is horrible, they read to you out of a book and do not treat you as a decent human never mind a paying costumer. I would recommend paying double to take a different airline. I have never had an okay flight with them. -10/10."
Nov 2019,50,Hawaii Vacation,Flew United to and from Honolulu. Flight was great the flight attendance were friendly bubbly and very professional. They answer questions quickly and we’re working very hard to make sure all passengers were doing well.    Over great flight got plenty of zzzs
Nov 2019,30,Transfer nightmare,The flights were fine. Service is sparse but ok. The real issue is Houston Intercontinental airport. It is a poster child of the nightmare of the hub and spoke model. It is massive and walking distances are insane. This was compounded by 3 gate changes before departure. Add in customs and transfer is really unpleasant . Security recheck was miserable. All in all the airline can be said to be ok but Houston airport is not. Sprawl and Security make it totally unpleasant experience.
Nov 2019,10,United Review,Unresponsive staff and highway robbery every time. You’ll never make your connection. Holidays will be spent on the tarmac.
Nov 2019,10,Not Tonight,"What went wrong? EVERYTHING!!. This is the worst of the worst. If you like delayed flights, concealed flight and getting lied to this you know this is the place to go. United you are in chaos and misstep. Broke down planes no answer very hard to work with. NO GO you will waste your money Delta was much better and NO i don't work for the any airlines. Just a guy on vacation the got screwed!"
Nov 2019,50,Best flight to take,"Taking a 15.35 hour trip is very long, therefore traveling on a Polaris class of service is very convenient. Plus traveling on this type of service one gets access to the lounge."
Nov 2019,10,The worst airline in America,There is nothing good about this airline. I travel regularly and cannot remember the last time I have had a round trip that was on time while flying United. They regularly have maintenance issues. Total trash airline. Fly anything else even if it is more expensive.
Nov 2019,10,All the ways an airline can be wrong...and then a few extra.,"Travellers beware...United has the only basic economy fare of any major airline that doesn't allow a single carry on domestically. Being forced to check bags at $30 each (one of the highest in the industry) will milk your wallet for every last dollar (and then some) you attempted to save. They're the only major airline whose basic economy policy will actually have the nerve to separate you and your child. In our case, they felt it fine to seat our 9 year old nowhere near either of us. It was up to the generosity of other passengers if I could sit with my child. I consider it a safety concern to let a child fly next to a random stranger. It's greatly representative of their lack of dedication to showing travelling families common respect or courtesy. Late takeoff, and HARD landing. Physically hard. Slammed onto the runway. The crew, attendants, pilots,and staff working the gates, were some of the rudest and least customer service oriented staff I've met on any airline. For a major airline, this behavior should be embarrassing. It was obvious to me the only thing United employees despise and resent more than their jobs, is the general public. The United Airlines PR nightmares you've read about in the news, seen on TV, or viral video? You get the feeling this behavior is more common than a few isolated incidents. This airline has filed chapter 11 multiple times. It's no wonder after they treated my family this way. Perhaps it's better for some businesses to crash and burn."
Nov 2019,10,Even worst than American,I would never ever fly United. The service and the food is terrible! Such a waste of $. Old plane and dirty!
Nov 2019,50,Patient Flight Attendants,"I was incredibly impressed with the professionalism of the crew on this flight. First, the plane needed to be de-iced at DEN and it was done quickly, allowing us to still arrive at SFO 20 minutes early.    More importantly, there was a young, belligerent man sitting in a window seat at the bulkhead. I could tell he was a trouble maker as he got upset when he had to move his backpack to an overhead cabinet for takeoff/landing and all the overheads nearby were full. He also continued working on his iPod at takeoff and pretended not to hear the flight attendants ask politely for him to move it up for takeoff. It got worse when we were preparing for landing, as he started yelling at the flight attendants for having to store his stuff in the back of the plane. The flight attendants politely found some space to accommodate him in the first class bin and helped diffuse a potential incident.    Major props for the crew's patience for a rude customer. I certainly don't have that level of patience and have newfound respect for what the do on a daily basis."
Nov 2019,50,Excellent,"I had no issues with the flight. I received the email to check-in and that was completed. On the flight, there were no issues and would definitely fly with United Airlines again. The ability to view free movies during the flight is always a plus."
Nov 2019,10,Nightmare!!!,"We boarded this 3 pm flight from Newark, and a thunderstorm hit New Jersey. Sure, we understand that flights get delayed and cancelled when bad weather happens. But what United made us go through was a nightmare. As we were boarding, the crew took our cabin baggage too saying the flight didn't have space in that area. After an hour on the flight we were made to de-board sans our luggage.    We were not given any information other than being asked to stand in the queue for speaking to a service person. The queue was a long one, the desks to handle the cancellations few. At the end of 5 hours, at 12 midnight we were told they couldn't give us tickets for any other flight on the next day or early on the 3rd day. No they cannot pay any compensation, nor can they accommodate us in any hotel.    Meanwhile my son had on the telephone got a flight replacement for 2 days later.    On being asked about our luggage, we were told to again stand in a queue at the baggage desk, manned by 2 persons, occasionally one. So yes it took us another 4 hours plus to be told that ""No we cant get our baggage, not even the cabin baggage that they had taken from us, which included our emergency set of clothes, toiletries and medicines for my Asthma."" No amount of pleading or arguing would budge them into lifting a finger to help us. The luggage they said, would be sent to San Francisco as it had been tagged for that airport. I pleaded to be allowed to identify my luggage, just the cabin bags alone, but to no avail.    So after spending 17 hours at the airport, 11 of which were spent standing in the United queues, we were left in a foreign country, an unknown city with just some money and the clothes we were standing in and told to fend for ourselves for the next 2 days.    We ended up spending a whopping amount on hotels, food and transport in New York, as also on a whole set of clothes including inner wear for the three of us.    The flight cancellation was due to the weather, the mishandling, total lack of imparting information and refusal to help distressed tourists was all United's abject failure."
Nov 2019,40,More leg room,I found United to have more leg room in economy compared to comparable major airlines. Annoying is that they turn down the lights for maybe 1 1/2 hr during an 8:45 flight. It seems they r always up and down the sidles when it would be nice to have some shut eye. Other than that flights were good
Nov 2019,40,Good,"Was flying from LAX via IAD to AMS. I generally like United a lot. Staff members are always very friendly and helpful. Ground staff at LAX even changed my seat when the plane was already fully booked. Food is delicious, they provide many snacks and drinks. And there is a lot of entertainment options available."
Nov 2019,40,Newark to Zurich on a cheap ticket,"I was going to a reunion in Germany and didn't want to spend lots of money. This basic fare was just fine, although it allows only carry on luggage. No problem! As is typical my seat assignment was next to someone, although the back of the plane was pretty empty. The flight attendants immediately offered me a different seat and I ended up having a whole row to myself. The flight was excellent. The biggest hassle was getting through the controls at Newark - it has to be one of the worst airports in this respect.  Flight back was also eventless and pleasant. In both cases the crew was helpful and friendly."
Nov 2019,40,Good Trip overall,Overall both coming and going we good. All flights were on time and landed early. Was able to move seats to an exit row on one flight. Flight crew coming back was really good.
Nov 2019,30,Least Comfortable of the US Majors,"I will be traveling from the DC area to Mexico City from time to time over the next few years. United's direct from Washington Dulles (UA 1566/1567) seems to be the best option for me. Unfortunately, I find United the least comfortable of the major US airlines.    The space in economy seems particularly cramped. On the way down this past week, I was very relieved when the guy in the middle seat next to me decided to upgrade to Economy Plus and moved. He was a bigger guy and I don't know how he would have sat there for 3.5 hours. It would have been a struggle for me in the aisle seat next to him. I could also upgrade to Economy Plus, but I've already added to the basic fare just to carry on a bag.    I also cannot believe that United flights planes to international destinations without seatback entertainment. They push the ""stream on your personal device option."" That works, but seems like a poor substitute.    Wish there were better options on Delta."
Nov 2019,10,"Disappointing Service, ""Hidden"" Fees","I fly pretty frequently, personally and for work. Of all the airlines I've taken United stands out as being the worst airlines, by far. ""Basic Economy"" doesn't include a carry on, if you would like to take a ""full size carry on"", you are forced to pay extra (+$30 each way) to check in a bag. If you do not check in your bag ""early"" enough, they will not let you on the flight. Absolute waste of time and money booking United. Recommend paying more to use other airlines i.e. American Air, JBLU, Southwest etc. or paying less and taking cheaper airlines i.e. Spirit. United is really the worst of both worlds, priced inefficiently and quality of service is quite disappointing."
Nov 2019,50,Excellence,"Our flight was excellent. Onboarding was fast and efficient, service was great and air crew very polite."
Nov 2019,50,Excellent flight,"Our flight was great. It was on time, onboarding was fast and efficient. Flight crew were great and service excellent."
Nov 2019,50,Excellent,Excellent service and excellent flight. Flight was delayed because plane was delayed elsewhere prior. Once plane arrived onboarding was done fast and we got to Chicago close to original time.
Nov 2019,30,An average flight,"This was an easy trip from the convention center, though the airport and on to the plane. The plane, a Boeing 737-900 (twin-jet) (B739) left on time and arrived at O'Hare on time. The air crew was efficient."
Nov 2019,50,Staci and Manny Were AMAZING!,"Staci and Manny were really wonderful flight attendants. I found them to be very friendly, helpful, and attentive.    This plane did have seatback entertainment, as well as working outlets and I had a wonderful experience!    Thank you United!"
Nov 2019,40,Great Staff!,"The flight crew, especially Veronica, the flight attendant, were incredibly attentive, and provided excellent service.    I do wish United had newer planes with setback entertainment and outlets that are not so old, the plug falls out."
Nov 2019,40,Flight From Mexico,"The trip from the States had a few problems with the equipment itself on one leg which caused a long delay. But that happens. The trip back from a Mexico went without a hitch. Everything was on time and the service was very good. No complaints,"
Nov 2019,30,United is trying but not all employees are up to standard,"Would have given 4 stars because I can truly see most employees try hard to make it a pleasant experience. The support folks at the gate that night were so confused, they send some of the folks waiting for the Fort Lauderdale to another gate on the other side of the concourse. I made it back just on time before they close the door (last person in the plain). To many ""I am sorry and my apologies "". They do not help.  I am not considering the fact that we departed late."
Nov 2019,10,United use to be a great airline not anymore.,I remember when flying United use to be comfortable not anymore. The seats are extremely small and uncomfortable. We look like sardines in a can. So disappointing. Economy class smells terrible because people buy many different foods it’s all in the air. The bathrooms are tiny; my husband is tall and he was very uncomfortable and we had a connection flight and I was hoping it was a bit more comfortable nope it wasn’t.
Nov 2019,10,United Sucks!,"Going on the fourth hour of delay and currently waiting on the THIRD replacement plane. How is this airline in business? Crappy service, cranky employees, terrible on time ratings!"
Nov 2019,20,Mediocre in every way,"First class seats were one aisle, two seats on each side. Comfortable but nothing special. TV/music was available on our phones and tablets only. No TV screens or music system was supplied except through wi-fi. Meals were very mediocre with two main choices available. I've had international tourist class meals that were much better with more courses, and a few options (more bread, etc.). I would not waste the money to fly first class again for what is basically a tourist-class flight."
Nov 2019,40,Nice Fllight,United has been getting a bad rap but I had no issues. Both legs of the trip were on time and without incident. Only flight I have been on for a long time where they actually served you a beverage and a small snack at no charge. I know it's not much but it was appreciated.
Nov 2019,30,Exactly what we hoped for,"I think because I usually fly economy, I figure that the most important things are on time and a smooth flight. Most of the other things, don't matter, because you're on a flying bus. Today we were on a Boeing 737-900 (twin-jet) (B739)s. Check-in went easy out of ORD (O'Hare Chicago). We left seven minutes early and arrived in Orlando about 15 minutes later. The crew was pleasant and efficient. The flight was mostly smooth."
Nov 2019,50,Really Improved their Customer Service,"Recently flown on United. I've got to say they customer service is really improving. On the flight not only the flight attendants but the captain thanked us several times and it was sincere. Easy flight, a little delay due to weather but got us to our destination on time."
Nov 2019,40,Usual experience,It was the usual kind of flight. Not much choice for economy seats - many more choices for seats that require extra payment. Service was fine - plane left and arrived on time. OK!
Nov 2019,40,On time,The flight was efficient and on time. The boxed meals were mediocre; one was OK and the other ...can't find words to describe it.
Nov 2019,30,Not a great value for the price but ok,"The seat its actually comfortable for economy class, and the plane had the individual screen for entertainment. The leg room is somehow getting even smaller by the day and thats what makes it uncomfortable.  Our flight was not extra-long but was not the shortest and the mini (and I mean mini) snack was too poor for the time spent on the aircraft, in similar flights we had been served snacks more adecuate for the same time.  All united personell is very kind and the plane is perfectly ontime always."
Nov 2019,40,IAD <--> EDI,"Washington Dulles to Edinburgh...non-stop, awesome timing, good service, decent food, lousy drinks selection."
Nov 2019,40,Honeymoon trip,"All of the flights were on time, with little hassle. My only complaint would be with the amount of room in the economy seats and the cost of upgrading to better seats, but this is the case on all airlines. Overall we were very satisfied with our flights."
Nov 2019,30,Longest delay we've ever experienced,"Due to mechanical issues, United had to fly another plane from Houston to Bonaire to pick us up causing a 12-hr delay, an overnight in Houston before we could continue our trip home, re-booking onto a next-day flight with loss of our premium seats, and ultimately arriving home 19 hours later than planned. However, United has been very responsive to requests to reimburse any documented additional expenses."
Nov 2019,50,It doesn’t hurt to ask,"I typically fly United because they offer the best range of times and I know their planes are solid. I had become disenchanted recently with being assigned the very last nonreclining seat (because I refused to pay for a seat when I’m not taking on any luggage) and I paid for WiFi which didn’t work. With 300 miles, which may not sound like much, but I’ve been saving years, I had made one last ditch effort to reach out to United about a booking problem. I was sure the answer would be no, but I had to ask because I had been a long term customer. To my delight, the agent went out of her way to help me in the predicament. I will continue to fly United with enthusiasm because of this small gesture of kindness. Thank you United customer care representatives!"
Nov 2019,30,Not a Good Value For What I Paid,"I took a flight from Ontario International Airport in California to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Looking for a comfortable seat to rest in an overnight flight, I paid a high rate in the first class.    The service was very good but the seat wasn't comfortable enough. They are bigger and have enough space for the feet but do not incline enough to take a rest. The inclination level is the same that the seats in the Class Economic.    I felt disappointed, I didn't receive what I expected."
Nov 2019,40,Early Oct 27 flight to Denver,"United emailed for me to arrive 3 hours before a 0:615 flight due to increased security at US Customs. They were open at 03:15 hrs, Baggage wasn't open until 04:00 and US Customs was open at 04:30. All went smoothly. Good to show up early as I was near the front of the line. I lost me receipt for the baggage and I used the united chat and they emailed me the receipt right away. Good to get the united app in advance. I was able to watch movies on my phone."
Nov 2019,20,Cancelled flight/prepaid baggage fee,"Road Scholar made my reservations for me and I prepaid the bag fees online ahead of the flight -United charged $30 for GEG/YQB and $22 for the return - YQB/GEG. The 11:40 pm flight was cancelled. I didn't want to miss the beginning of the Road Scholar program, and was able to get on an early Delta flight the next morning. Delta charged me $30 for my bag. I sent a refund request of $30 to United for the cancelled flight; but they only refunded $22. I know it's only $8; but really! It seems like they could do better. I missed a day of my vacation and had hotel expenses that weren't reimbursed. I also missed out on mileage points. I sent a second request to United for the $8 and asked for some miles. They never did get back to me; but I see the claim was denied. I know cancelled flights and hassles are a part of travel; but I also like to feel valued as a customer - it really doesn't take much.... United only has one late flight out of Spokane a day, so if it's cancelled there's a 24 hour wait for the next flight. I know I'll try and avoid the risk of booking United."
Nov 2019,50,United Polaris,"We thoroughly enjoyed our Polaris service to SYD and back from MEL. The service was excellent both ways, great attentive and timely crew. My husband had the salmon meal on the way over but it was not that good. Our meals on the return flight were much better. Our crew was very welcoming and on top of all their service as I hate to ask for items and appreciate crews that can anticipate my needs.  The aircraft was NOT the brand new Polaris suites but the seats were still lay flat with nice bedding, gel pillow and due to the length of the flight we got Polaris PJs!  Only way to travel on a LONG flight!"
Nov 2019,40,You get what you pay for,"Flight was nothing out of the ordinary. Paid to check bags in Roc. In Nashville the check in did not charge my travel companion to check her bag and I had prepaid on line. So I'll never pre pay again :) We choose the economy class where you can not pick your seats, and no carry on allowed, but were seated together on all flights which was great! Tickets for premium economy were more than the check bag fee so that is why we went with the basic economy option."
Nov 2019,10,Waterboarding Passenger...,"Even by the standards of United Airlines, this was a horrible experience. The lounge was not any nicer than the area outside. Once at the gate, passengers are required to undergo another round of security, including having to dump their freshly filled water bottle, and since they did not provide a place to dump the water, they force passengers to drink it. One business class passenger was forced to drink until she threw it up, while the security people shouted ""Drink It!"" at her. A gate agent later announced that these security requirements were the doing of US government, except I did not see the same thing at the Delta gate. On board, the seat area was dirty, with crumbs on the floor (seat 1B/C - first row aisle seat on the left side facing the cockpit). The bathroom too quickly became very dirty, and the food was pretty awful. If you have to fly this route, you may have little choice, but brace yourself and do NOT fill up your water bottle until you see what's going on at the gate."
Nov 2019,40,"OK, for 2019...",The seats are too close together for older people to navigate easily.  The rest room was miniscule. Don't know how heavy folks manage!  Staff was friendly and helpful  Flight was on time
Nov 2019,40,1st time EVER,"Boarding for the flight was the usual but well controlled chaos. The flight itself was smooth and uneventful. the cabin stewards were as attentive as possible when considering they handle 200 + people.  The best part of the flight, and for the 1st time EVER, we taxied directly to a gate and got off the plane. No circling the airport, no sitting on a runway waiting! I was surprised at how happy this made me"
Nov 2019,40,Flight to Chicago,My flight experience was good and the staff was nice and handed out snacks to those flying on the plane. It was a smooth ride for the most part. On our way back from the O'Hare International Airport they dimmed the lights on the plane for people who wanted to rest during the night so that was good.
Nov 2019,20,held up in MDT for ground crew,"First of all United changed my airline reservations to connect in Chicago to connect in DC. A total waste of time...going south to go west. Then in Harrisburg, we were delayed for 45 minutes while we waited for a ground crew to move the walk ramp. As anyone knows.... Harrisburg is not a busy airport. It was very frustrating."
Nov 2019,50,First class upgrade,I have been flying with United for over 10 years and when took this vacation I got pleasantly surprised when we got bumped to first class.  Crew as always was pleasant and polite. Little more pleasant in first than what I experience in economy plus. The meals offered in first class were very good. On the way to Cancun we had a big breakfast that included cup of fresh fruit and jogger in addition to the main course and on the way back we had a chicken and salmon meals. We always share so I can tell you that both were very good.  One issue that I have is on the way to Cancun we were given visa form to fill out and forms were in Spanish with no English explanation so if you are heading to Mexico remember to have a pen with you and don’t be afraid to ask people around you for help.
Nov 2019,40,Good communication of flight delays,"At 10 Am I received a text from United that our 3 PM flight was delayed due to a major operational issue, until 10:29 PM! There was a link, so we were lucky to be able to re-book on a 5 PM flight. Definitely sign up for texts - made all the difference. We enjoyed a couple of hours walking along the river rather than sitting in the airport. That flight, after we boarded, had technical difficulties, but we did take off about an hour late, which, considering the circumstances, was not SO bad. LOTS of turbulence, but of course that's not United's fault."
Nov 2019,30,Aged Equipment Leads to Mechanical Delays,"We had many United flights this year. Delays due to mechanical issues were several. The latest was a freezing flight to Las Vegas on an old 757 with cold air streaming from the ceiling compartment for the life raft and a vent over my head in the aisle. The attendant kindly put duct tape over the aisle vent. Also she requested that the crew warm up the compartment...to minimal avail. BTW: there were no blankets or pillows on board. Add to this, my wife's seat would not stay reclined but popped back to upright.  Also, the food was disgusting and barely edible. The ""Tandori Chicken"" looked like a cow chip.  Suggest you check the equipment for your scheduled flight and consider other carriers."
Nov 2019,50,Visit to family in Los Angeles,"Always on time, smooth flight, good food and films and the staff are very courteous and helpful. Flight costs are very reasonable."
Nov 2019,40,Fine Flight,"The United Airline flight was just fine for a business trip. Before boarding, I felt welcome and well-considered even if I had to go through an additional control of hand luggage. During the flight, Stewards did a good job and paid attention to the needs of everyone.  It made the experience very comfortable and relaxing."
Nov 2019,50,A decent flight,"This was a pretty pleasant flight. There seemed to be a little more leg room than normal. The one thing I thought was strange is that on all the United flights on this trip, all the cookies/pretzels/snacks were serviced to the entire cabin and then they went back and served the drinks."
Nov 2019,30,Flight Delayed Many Times,"We waited through many updates telling us that our flight would be delayed and delayed again. We were supposed to take off at 7:15 pm and did not board until 10:45. The airline tried; they served snacks to waiting passengers, There were several flights which were delayed that evening. One flight previous to ours announced that they would be financially compensating passengers for the inconvenience, Although that was not offered for our inconvenience, I thought the crew were very thoughtful, and that the airline tried to do their best with a bad situation."
Nov 2019,40,Trip out West,"Love the Dreamliner that United flies for their longer flights. The seats are comfortable and the inflight entertainment screens are really nice. Is it my imagination but are the seats a little bigger with more leg room, even in economy? If all of my flights were on this plane I'd be a much happier traveler!"
Nov 2019,30,Very interesting flight,"What makes it interesting Is the flight had a medical emergency of which I’ve never been on a flight before with one. We had to divert to another airport. A doctor and a nurse came forward to help a the person. One stewardess stands out she stayed to help the whole entire time was kind courteous. The others not so much and none of them seemed to know what to do in a medical emergency.  I feel after seeing this the stewardess should be highly trained in medical because if there is no doctors or nurses on board, they need to be able to help.  Overall I will continue to fly United"
Nov 2019,20,Ugly,Very noisy during all thé flight ( night)many children were crying .  Thé Food was very poor and very bad
Nov 2019,40,Girls trip !,"Flew Toronto to Phoenix with 7 girl friends .. staff was very kind, Seats comfortable, Flights were on time and carefree. Would definitely recommend united airlines and use this airline again in the future !"
Nov 2019,50,Polaris class changed our view,"Upon boarding United we were immediately impressed with the plane's interior for the Polaris class - business - comfort and privacy were the pinnacle of design and function.  The food impressive as was the service.    On our return flight from De Gaulle, the lounge, food service were all impressive. The target was comfort and privacy and United hit it."
Nov 2019,10,Knoxville to Chicago,"United Uninformed or dishonest delay of two hours in Knoxville, the pilot said every 20 minutes was waiting for mechanic to sign off on paperwork for an oil change this was 2 hours sitting at gate. This is a very small airport. As a former retired airplane investigator this could not be true, then pilot would add any minute now for this paper work this signing off.  Arriving at gate off plane in Chicago with 40 minutes to spare to catch connecting flight to Sea  Arriving gate agent could have easily called the connecting gate saying we were here and on our way over. Same airline United, same terminal, no communication between gates The gate agent said you can prob catch it if you hustle. We did,  Arrived at departing connecting gate closed up plane and jetways still in place.  Our seats were given to standby even before 30 minutes before departure boarding.  Then not done yet, next available flights to Sea were 7 hours later,  We were given $10,00 meal vouchers. And a drink on flight.  Upon arriving in Seattle near midnight we landed on tarmac deplaned to buss into terminal. no where near close to baggage claim."
Nov 2019,10,"Good and Bad Service, as usual","Two reasons I've always tried to avoid flying on United Airlines, are the inconsistencies of free in-flight meals, and in-cabin services, on ANY class.  On this flight, there are no meal services, which is fine. However, before I even got to my seat, I had my hand on why I disliked United so much. The cleaners had missed a spot on a headrest next to the aisle, and I touched that sticky spot. It's gross!  I told the flight attendant about it and he just wanted to blame the cleaners. I politely requested that he should wipe that spot before somebody else gets the ""present"". He reluctantly did so, and didn't offered any paper towels to me as he walked by (I had just used my hand sanitizer). I asked, nicely, for one and he rudely asked me to go get some myself from the lavatory.  He also kept saying, ""What do you want me to do? Wash your hands for you?!"" Well, no, I just want a paper towel or hand wipes, and a polite person. Is that too much to ask for? Or would that cost me extra?"
Nov 2019,50,Grand Junction to Maui,"What a great roundtrip not having to fly through a big west coast airport. Being able to connect through Denver and fly direct to Kahului on a Boeing 777 was great. Even though the flight over was full, we got great service.  Thankfully, the return flight had plenty of room for us to spread out and get a little sleep.  One of the most surprising things about these planes is the spacious bathrooms. You could actually move around and change clothes if necessary.  With the charging outlets and wi-fi, this was one of the better long-distance flights we've taken lately.  We'll be heading to Maui again soon!"
Nov 2019,50,Florida fun,"Excellent and professional service, food was fair, they need to improve selections of food.On time and we could hear the all the announcements"
Nov 2019,50,Great flight,Early morning flight. Flight crew was awesome and very friendly. Short layover in Miami before heading to Tallahassee. Very short flight landed earlier than expected.
Nov 2019,10,The new Spirit Airlines,"Delayed on almost every flight I have with United. They also have terrible options for customer service -- ""basic economy"" is the worst deal ever. One time my vacation plans changed and ended up losing all $300 I paid for the flight because they don't offer refunds or flight changes. You can't carry on a bag either, and if you try to they'll charge you $50. They used to have good service but now they're turning into nothing better than Spirit. Bought a replacement flight from another airline that ended up being cheaper than United and had much better options for carrying on bags and seats."
Nov 2019,10,Our Premium Economy seats were resold. The worst Economy seats! Are they even legal?,"Given the generally negative press, United is an airline I don’t use unless there is no other good option. We were heading to Denver with friends, and flight #393 was the only viable choice. I purchased our premium economy tickets many months before our flight. We had aisle and center seats in row 8.  We met our friends, and we proceeded to the check in counter. Since my husband and I had premium economy seats, we had priority boarding. I never looked at the boarding passes prior to entering the aircraft. A mistake I’ve never made nor will make again. I didn’t recall our aisle as we made our way into the plane. I looked at the paper pass and noted it had us in the 20 something row. I was unfamiliar with this plane, so I kept walking back. My seat was a middle economy seat, last row in the plane. My husband was seated in the row in front of me by the window. Truly the worst seats on this or any other plane! Realizing the error, I grabbed my phone, which contained our original seats, and we made our way up the front to speak with an attendant. People were pouring into the plane, and we felt like salmon swimming upstream. I noted that people were already sitting in our more expensive seats. The attendant looked at our reservation, then apologized. She said planes were switched that morning, and our priority seats were wiped clean. They obviously resold our seats at a serious premium. Yes, I probably could have made a scene but that’s not my style. Instead I planned on getting a price adjustment in Denver. I’m a size 6, which I believe is smaller than our national average, yet my legs were pushing against the seat in front of me. My fellow seatmates were also amazed at the terrible seat configuration. The man seated on the aisle dropped his pen, and our row had to get out of the seats so he could retrieve it. How is this even legal? In case of an emergency, none of us would be able to evacuate the plane!  In Denver, the customer service person was nice, yet they still tried to extract maximum dollars. When processing our refund for the difference in ticket price, she said, “you had priority boarding, and that costs x, so you won’t get that portion back.” I smiled at the absurdity of the statement. I replied, “priority boarding to the very last seat of the plane? Really”? She got it! We were refunded correctly. We are frequent flyers. Had United been smart, they would have given us a credit towards a future flight. That would have ensured our business a second time, and we could have had a better experience. The lack of forethought solidifies my previously held position. United will remain in the recesses of my mind when choosing a carrier for future travel."
Nov 2019,10,"$1,878 upgrade cost us alot more","Never again with United Airlines. My wife and I are returning from our “Dream Vacation” in Bora Bora (BOR); however, getting here and going home have been absolute nightmares. We started our trip on Nov 7th from BWI to SFO. Upon arriving at SFO we decided to upgrade the next (8 hour) leg of the trip to first class, and I can assume that is where the problems began. We arrived in Papeete (PPT), Tahiti without problem, but when we checked in for our flight from PPT to BOR the next morning, one hour before the flight, we are told we do not have tickets. The ticket agent sees that we have confirmed reservations, but says we are not ticketed. She says it appears United Airlines has “refunded” our tickets, and in order to continue on to BOR, we must buy new tickets now and work it out with UA later. With only minutes to spare before they start boarding (10 minutes before departure), we have no option but to purchase new tickets. Mind you this abbreviated version does not include my angry discussion with the Air Tahiti employees, sure they were the ones who had made the mistake, nor my wife’s plea to me to calm down so I wouldn’t end up in a Tahitian jail, but as you can imagine I was not a happy traveler.  After arriving in BOR and checking into our resort I got online and sent a message to UA with all of the details I could include in 1,000 characters and pictures of the new ticket receipts, hoping to not only find some resolution, but also ensure we were good to go for our return. Days later my wife received an email confirming receipt of my correspondence, and they would reply in 7 to 14 Days. We attempted to place a wifi-call on 12 November, much to my surprise it went through. For more than two hours I tried to explain the issues to the United Airlines reservation specialist, and eventually supervisor (Mark L., employee #56839). After the two hours had passed, I was told he could not do anything about the ticketing issues for our trip to BOR, but he assured me we were ticketed and would have NO PROBLEM for our return flight, and we were emailed a new itinerary with e-ticket numbers.  We are leaving BOR today, and decided to leave the comfort of our resort early to avoid a last minute rush if there was a problem with our tickets; we were booked on the last flight out for the night and didn’t have accommodations if we missed it. It came as no surprise this time to me or my wife when we stood a little longer than anyone else at the ticket desk while the agent pounded away at the keyboard, then the familiar question, “may I see your receipt or itinerary?” Seems the assurance and guarantee of the UA Reservation Supervisor that we would have NO PROBLEM for our return was worthless, and I am glad we had the foresight to check in for our flight much earlier than necessary. The Chief ticket agent for Air Tahiti in BOR worked for well over an hour to try and find our tickets, with the following conclusions. United did something to take away our tickets and did not give us new ones, and the e-ticket numbers provided to us on our receipt returned “No information found.” Thus, we were forced once again to purchase tickets we have already once paid for. I asked the agents in BOR if this is a regular occurrence; the Chief agent said “with United, yes”, and her coworker shook his head in agreement.  So, as we wait for the next leg of our trip back to the US from PPT, I want to take this time to sincerely sarcastically THANK United Airlines for making travel to and from our “Dream Vacation” an absolute nightmare. An upgrade that initially cost us $1,878 has cost us an additional approximate $800 in new tickets; time lost dealing with the issue both with the 2+ hour phone call, and departing our resort early in case there were issues; and an immeasurable amount of stress dealing with a number of concerns regarding our travel, our vacation, and our well-being. My wife and I have a number of miles with UA we intend to use for short domestic trips; otherwise, we will never be travelling with UA again."
Nov 2019,40,United first class,"10/21/19 -my sons 1st birthday was 10/6 and this was apart of our celebration for him. it was also our First time in United first class.we love the comfort of the lay flat seats👍🏾 .The attendant That morning treated us like family. She gave us pointers on flying with a baby since this was our first family trip.I regretfully forgot her name ,but she’s Chamorrita . She even took my son when he was acting up and showed him around the plane. Thank you so much ma’am, you made our anxiety level disappear and helped us through the flight 💙GIVE THAT WOMAN A RAISE!🙏🏾  The food that morning Was French toast.it wasn’t really good though.how do you mess up on French toast🤣? There was also one attendant lady(Japanese) that came off pretty rude.she had an issue with my other half’s purse not fitting all the way in the cubby hole in front of us.(it also came out during take off )She tried to stuff it in more and seemed so irritated about it. The other lady with 2 kids (1 lap baby, 1 toddler )across us had their bags on the floor not The cubby hole the whole flight so ,I don’t know what her problem was. Maybe because she was Japanese too 🤷🏾‍♂️.Thankfully all my baby’s medications(albuterol ,ipotropium bromide and saline ) in the purse didn’t break."
Nov 2019,50,Quick and Easy Flight,"This was a smaller aircraft, but very good legroom and only two seats on each side of the aisle. The flight seemed very quick and pleasant and we received a beverage and small snack on this short flight."
Nov 2019,20,They think it is about the seats.,"My husband and I were traveling with my elderly in-laws to Honolulu from Calgary. We were booked on 2 separate itineraries. We tried to check in at home in Calgary but we were unable. We were spending the night at the airport hotel so we tried at the airport to check in for the next day. We were told by Air Canada ( our first flight was on them to San Francisco) they they were unable to check us in but try in the morning. I gave United a call ( as there were no United agents on anymore in Calgary at 7pm). I asked if we could possibly get on the United Express flight in the morning instead of Air Canada just in case the 2 airlines weren’t communicating well and that was the problem. The reservation agent was unable to do that without charging us another $400 each. We didn’t like that answer so we went looking for another Air Canada agent to help us. He said it appears that we had 2 bookings and that was the confusion. We were asked if we had made any changes to our original booking but we had not. He played around with the computer and was able to get us checked in. We were relieved. We checked our bags the next morning and all seemed good. We got a text at 7am from United saying there was an aircraft swap and they may not be able to honour our seats. We weren’t happy at that point however, while we were boarding in San Fran, the agent said my husband and I weren’t on the flight. My in-laws were extremely upset at the thought of traveling without us. Luckily the agent was able to sneak us on the flight and even gave us paper tickets in case it happens on our return. Unfortunately we are unhappy that we had booked 8 months before because we wanted an emergency exit row. My husband is 6’3” and we deliberately book early and usually pay extra money just to secure those seats. In previous years we travelled in business class but due to a much higher rate we were unable to. We looked at other airlines but chose United due to availability of an exit row with just 2 seats. We have been traveling this route for many years and since the addition of the extra 2 seats in a row the 777 has become an extremely uncomfortable aircraft to be on for tall people. The agents at both Air Canada and United were very good and I don’t fault them for anything. They did their best. As it stands we left 1 hour and 25 minutes late due to a problem with the pressurization on the aircraft and were squished in the middle of the aircraft.    My bigger issue that there was an initial problem with the booking and, but for the fact the flight wasn’t full, my husband and I wouldn’t have been travelling on our booked flight. It caused my in-laws an incredible amount of stress not knowing if we would make it on this flight. I have always defended United Airlines to my family and friends because they always fixed their mistakes. Well after I have spoken to United to complain their customer service representative apologized for us not getting our seats. It isn’t that. They gave away our seats because we weren’t even on the flight??? We were just lucky to get on at all. I cannot believe that United didn’t even offer a token amount to say sorry for our inconvenience. They have always been good in the past. Sometimes they added points and sometimes they gave us credit for a future flight. All we got was a refund for the seats we paid for and didn’t get. I thought I would share my story with anyone who will listen and remind them they have choices in the airlines they choose and maybe United is past their prime when it comes to customer service!"
Nov 2019,40,Flight to Hawaii (went through San Francisco),A week before our trip we were offered the opportunity (for a price) to upgrade our seats from Economy to Premium Economy and I am so glad we upgraded. The Economy seats were very cramped and would have been very uncomfortable. The Premium Economy had more leg and seat room. The flight crew on each of our flights were nice and helpful.
Nov 2019,50,Early flight from Denver to Los Angeles,"The boarding process went smoothly. Seating was 6 across with a comfortable seat and adequate leg room. There were entertainment consoles in the seat backs. The cabin service during the flight was good. There were free soft drinks and light snacks. For a fee, you could get alcohol and/or a meal. The flight arrived on time."
Nov 2019,50,Polaris Lounge LAX,"The new Polaris Lounge at Terminal 7 is much smaller than its sibling at SFO. In fact, the nice receptionist called it ""quaint"". The highlight of the lounge has to be its Dining Room, where you can order made to order dishes like a sit down restaurant. The staff recommended the stuffed French Toast and it was delicious. The lounge also offers shower suites and quiet rooms."
Nov 2019,40,Direct from Scotland,"Having traveled to the USA regularly and to New York on several occasions I would find it very easy to criticise this flight by United Airlines. It was an older plane and the food was reasonably good but not great. However the check in, flight service by the cabin crew and times of the flights in both directions were excellent. Newark is a great airport and with the direct flight from Edinburgh it will be the first point of research and probable booking for our next flights to the USA.  As with all airlines the fairs are reasonable if booked in advance.  I would recommend this flight without hesitation."
Nov 2019,10,Never again!,"I am going to leave here my frustration and disappointment regarding my first and last trip with United Airlines from Burlington International Airport. Hoping that by using a public platform, perhaps someone will come forward and show us a willingness to want to help us. You never know!    November 12th: departure date for our Burlington-Havana flight with connection in Newark. The storm is already well started so I make sure of course that we have not received an email or any notification of schedule change for the flight. Nothing. So we hit the road that will prove painful and arduous. Arrived at the airport, completely exhausted from the road of 3 hours in the snow, a United employee with no sense of empathy announces that the flight is canceled. They put us on the same flight 24 hours later. We must take a hotel room in Burlington. And United offers us no compensation since ""the weather is involved"". However, at the scheduled time of takeoff, the storm was over, and there were only light flakes on the horizon. Something was strange: all other flights, even those using similar routes (Boston for example), were taking off. Also, there was almost no one but us for this flight at the United Airlines counter 🤔. Something leads us to believe that they had other real reasons to cancel the flight. (It is important to mention that it is always more advantageous for airlines to put the weather in question when canceling flights, because in this way they release themselves from all responsibility, including that of paying for the night of hotel).  2. Did I mention the total lack of professionalism of United Airlines employees at Burlington Airport? The lady could not have looked like she cared less  3. We expressed our frustration that we had not received any notification that the flight was canceled and that we were forced to pay for a hotel room in Burlington. We were told that if we want, as a ""compensation"", we could change our return flight at no cost to the next day so as not to shorten our trip. We could not give them an immediate answer (we have to check with the babysitter, the job, the hotel, etc.). We were told not to worry - a note would be left in our file and we could contact United later to make the change, as long as seats remain in the flight.  4. The next day we show up at the check-in counter as soon as it opens - we want to make sure we do not miss our flight this time! Then, another problem 😣 Something is not working with the check-in recording. There is a bug with the system and they are not able to register us. The supervisor does not seem to understand what is going on or know how to handle the situation. We wait anxiously for very long minutes while the supervisor speaks on the phone with someone without knowing what is going on. Time passes and we are less than 15 minutes from boarding time (we have to pass the security) so I obviously start to worry that we will not be able to get on our flight. I communicate my concern to the supervisor and he almost responds in a threatening tone that I must stop complaining. I mention in my defense that it is stressful for us and he replied that it is also stressful for him! (Ehhhhh it's not you who will miss his flight so what's the report !!)  5. From Cuba, we make the necessary arrangements to change our return date as proposed by United, so as not to lose 24 hours of our trip. However, at the time of finalizing the whole thing, we are told that there is no note in the file and it is therefore impossible to make the change without cost!    In short, all of this is a lesson for us! Never again United Airlines from Burlington to save some money. Canadian airlines are much more respectful of their customers and at least in our country, there are laws to protect travelers for similar situations"
Nov 2019,40,Smooth Flying!,"The four flights that I took on a recent trip to Florida were surprisingly smooth! It is a sad commentary on the airline industry, but very accurate! All flight attendants were kind and welcoming. I choose the front row of Premium Economy seating for legroom, comfort and space to stow my carry-on under the seat in front of me. It was worth it for the extra $30 - $40 per flight. All of the flights were on time, except for a weather type delay leaving Houston. The last few trips that we have booked with United Airlines have been trouble free, which makes us more likely to fly the friendly skies with United again!"
Nov 2019,20,Bait & Switch,"Booked two seats in business class months in advance. Approx 2 days before the flight, while we were out of the country and not able to be contacted, UA cancelled our flight and re-booked us on another flight in economy. (Upon our arrival home, we verified they had not emailed the change as we were told they had.) Upon our arrival at the airport, the agent saw no problem with this and, rather than a refund of some amount because we paid for business class and were being booked in economy, he tried to charge us for our luggage which would have been without charge in business class. The agent was arrogant and condescending but he finally checked our bags without charge and found one remaining seat in business class. He was obviously not happy about it but since we refused to leave he probably did it just to get rid of us. Will never fly United again and can't say I would recommend it to anyone I liked."
Nov 2019,40,Good flight,Flight was good. Could not hear a lot of info but it was ok. I asked for tapas dinner and did not have any. Boo
Nov 2019,40,United an Airline on time,"UNITED serves nicely on the route Bogota Newark Geneve but as a regular passenger also on other airlines, I would suggest aircrafts serving international flights, should be worked more on cleanliness.  Seats are smelly and air filters may not be changed as frequently as required for a fresher air flow.    I find truly disgusting, how people from the nearby seat lines, take of their shoes and stretch out. Odors and more odors...yeak!..."
Nov 2019,40,Kona Hawaii vacation,"Generally speaking, it was a routine flight from Reno, Nevada through San Francisco to Kona, Hawaii. Made all the connections on time with no delays. But as usual, the seating has been so compressed that it is not a comfortable ride for a 6 ft male weighing 250."
Nov 2019,40,"Long flight to,from","The flight Attendants were nice they asked if you wanted a water,then they gave you a snack,you could watch a movie on the Airline link to their app"
Nov 2019,30,flight ok,"has no movies for such a long flight, people with children, strollers etc. put the strollers in the isles so no one can get out. It's like they are the only ones on the plane."
Nov 2019,40,It's economy,"I'm not sure that you can expect much more from Economy Class these days. The flight was fine, no significant delays, there was a snack and drinks, everyone was friendly. The arrival terminal (A) in Newark is certainly not my favorite. The biggest complaint with this is that the gate monitors/screens are incredibly hard to read with small print,the reading of which essentially requires you to stand immediately in front of the monitor. But it was clean and plenty of charging stations. I've been in far, far worse."
Nov 2019,30,Good value but do not expect any more than that,"I booked quite close to my departure date and got very reasonably priced return flights to Dulles. The flight attendants were friendly and the flight schedule was kept without any delay inbound or out. Satisfactory if not a little uncomfortable. The food was somewhat deplorable (I thought the era of bad airline food had passed). Recommend, yes, but always on a full stomach."
Nov 2019,20,Very disappointed and here is what you should know...,"#1.If you want to bring just a carry on, United will NOT let you get a Boarding Pass without coming to the gate and having someone sign you off. They want you to pay for a bag to check in! Big money making scam to take away the convenience of getting your boarding pass on line.  #2 Both departing and return flights were delayed 40-60 minutes, then we waited 20-30 minutes in line to take off.  #3 The planes on their Express shorter flights have no plug in for headphones or access to music/video."
Nov 2019,40,Decent company,"Flight was good - left on time, staff was nice, entertainment selection was good as well. The only downside was the food - I don't expect much out of airplane food, but this was really terrible."
Nov 2019,30,Long Flight,"Brace yourself for the long flight to Hawai’i from the East Coast. Bring snacks and a meal on the plane with you. United only has food for purchase. So glad, that I took a puzzle book, books, head phones and a blanket for the flight. The temperature on the plane was a bit cold. Pick an asle seat. You’re going to need it. I was able to stand without asking others to move. Overall, the fight was good. Only wished I didn’t have to purchase meals for the long flight (10 hour)."
Nov 2019,40,Uneventful (which is excellent),"Took a quick trip up to Quebec from Cleveland. Stop threw Newark, which is a completely inefficient airport. A couple of hour layover was not too bad. Service on all flights was great. Flight attendant was attentive and polite. Easy to get in and out of Quebec. Airport seemed newer and not too large."
Nov 2019,30,Can't expect much,"Plane was full. Attendants were not nice, but what do you expect from this carrier? At least we left on time and arrived on time."
Nov 2019,10,Worst airline ever!!!,"I am sure there is a common trend with most airlines, but UA has mastered and found found the most efficient way to give you less and less for ever increasing prices. The customer service is non-existent either in the lounges or the planes. Because of the quantity and quality of lounges the one-time passes are the biggest gimmick - every time I tried to use mine -sorry we are too busy to except these was the answer."
Nov 2019,30,Very Little Extras,"The flight itself was routine. Staff was quite friendly and check in was smooth.  However, I find it unconscionable that not even a normal sized check in luggage is allowed on an international flight. After all, if a passenger is leaving for a different country he/she must need basic clothing and amenities. The almighty dollar is not everything. Customer service and sensitivity to their needs should be the driving theme for all airlines"
Nov 2019,40,Pretty good 5 hour flight,Sitting in the middle seat in a Boeing 737 you don't expect it to be a great flight experience. In a 5 hour flight I do acknowledge the Customer service at the gates and flight attendants made my first time trip to LAS a pleasureable one.
Nov 2019,20,Most cramped flight of my life!,"""Basic economy"" is a step lower than Economy. Seating is cramped and uncomfortable. Allowing only one flight bag lets them make back on baggage fees what they lost on low initial ticket prices. Luckily, the aisles are too narrow for people to head for the toilets unless it's an emergency.  A mid-Atlantic hurricane meant we had a very turbulent flight. Can't blame them for the weather."
Nov 2019,20,Not service oriented,"The airlines continue to find ways to nickle and dime travelers and United seems to be as good as any in this regard. After paying an upgrade fee to have an aisle seat, I tried to check in online only to find that unless I paid more to add a bag to my reservation, I could not check in online. So disappointing! United has gone downhill in recent years to become my least favorite airline. Just not as service oriented as the once were. I would put them in the class of discount carrier these days."
Nov 2019,30,Great gal at the ticket counter. Very uncomfortable flight.,"I don't know why, but we felt like 2 sardines crammed into a 1ounce tin. My tailbone ached 20 minutes into the flight. My 6'1"" son could hardly move. I really wanted to use the bathroom, but it seemed like climbing Everest. I know this was not the airline's fault but our seatmate (aisle) acted like we were not supposed to be there. I wished I ate some broccoli. He hogged my arm area and my leg area."
Nov 2019,40,"Busy airport, Ft Lauderdale, but flight on time","There were at least 7 cruise ships in port and the airport was packed. Every seat in lounge near gate was taken (some just with bags). Flight arrived just before noon and we started boarding just about what boarding pass stated. We arrived at Chicago close to expected arrival time but we had to taxi over a mile to the gate. Luggage arrived at carresol shortly after we got there 5 - 6 minutes, we had our bags by 4PM"
Nov 2019,40,Mainly a good airline but not always consistent,"I am a long time customer. I have experienced outstanding service as well as mediocre to poor service.  The best service I ever experienced, when I took my 88 year old mother to Harlingen. The crew were outstanding. They went above and beyond to make my elderly mother as comfortable as possible.  My last trip, October 2019, was not a pleasant one. I was traveling with two family members and we were not even offered a cup of water.  It seems not every crew group is ""trained' to give the same service in all flights."
Nov 2019,40,United Airlines show the difference!!!,"My flight was schedule to depart SJU at 1240 hrs on Sat. Nov.02,2019. It was delay until 1535 hrs. Few minutes later, my flight was CANCELLED; but thanks GOD, it was automatically booked to a flight departing at 1630 hrs, making it to EWR a little over four(4) hrs.(LATE),but UA show the difference booking me, and I really appreciate it. I understand that this thing can happen and that UA Top Managers will not see these remarks but if they do, they can feel PROUD of UA Staff here in San Juan, Puerto Rico!!!  ""Thank you very much United Airlines for making the difference"",  Very Respectfully,  PK"
Nov 2019,50,Excellent,"I have been traveling quite a bit this year and have to say that while I had some poor experiences with United, they have really made a change with service standards across the board. I prefer to give my bags at curb side which is expeditious and avoid the hassle of going through the kiosk. The flight attendants with this trip was extremely polite and service oriented and deserve recognition.    Thank you United!"
Nov 2019,30,Less than good first class service,"Recent round trip first class trip from FLL to Williston ND was much less than a first class experience. Nothing related to the route. I’m testing United as an alternate to the other dominant S Fla carriers. I typically purchase First Class airfare for the increased comfort, amenities and overall service. I was not happy with the plane itself. No entertainment other than the std WIFI the seats were larger but limited recline and local power for charging devices was not working properly. The food was average. Bar service was acceptable.  Unfortunately my search for a better than my current flyer will continue."
Nov 2019,40,Much Better This Time,"This was a five plus hour trip and was definitely a lot better than the trip I took with them last time. At least this time they decided to use a more comfortable and roomier plane and to at least keep the bathrooms half way clean. USA airlines still could take a few hints from Asian airlines when it comes to cleanliness, comfort, and food but United at least is trying to get better."
Nov 2019,30,Tiny seats,"Crammed into rows, 3 seats on each side of aisle.  Long flight crammed into tiny seats.  Tickets indicated No Carry On. We paid for 2 checked bags. We carried only small items designated as ""personal items"". Other passengers were boarding with carry ons and using the overhead cabinets.  I would try and find an airline with larger seats."
Nov 2019,50,Trip to NYC for the Marathon,"Myself and my wife travelled to NYC in November 19 to run the New York Marathon.  We had never flown with United Airlines before were hugely impressed with them on our first journey.  The staff from check in, boarding, in flight and upon landing were really friendly and helpful.  We were in economy but the seats were large & comfortable feeling like a higher class. There was a variety of services on board and we had several drinks and 2 meal services during the flight which were delivered on time and really nice.  Overall a great experience and we would fly with them again - definately recommend using their services."
Nov 2019,50,A direct flight to MCI is a treat!,When you live in flyover country a direct flight to your destination is a treat and makes the flight experience so much better. United flies direct to San Francisco and while the going is early and the return late the crews are peppy and make you feel welcome . Our food was good and getting off at a terminal near baggage claim makes you feel that your flight was valued.
Nov 2019,40,"Apart from a few inconveniences, a good trip","First the negative. The gate was changed without announcing it. Finally, noticing the gate board change, passengers asked and were directed to a different gate, after which time it was announced. The two gates were a long ways apart. Hard for elderly. The temperature in flight was very cold. Everyone put on extra shirts, jackets, etc, including a few who put the hoods up on their coats. The pilots comments were incomprehensible, being given in the typical ""pilot's voice"" and at a volume that couldn't be understood. No TV or radio jacks. Everything is Wi-Fi, which, as an elderly man, I don't understand so couldn't take advantage of. Their were 2 screaming kids behind us, which isn't United's fault.    Having said that, the flight was on time leaving and arriving, the attendants were top class, very professional and friendly. There was sufficient space for luggage. The food and service, including beverages, was great. So, apart from a few inconveniences, the flight was good."
Nov 2019,20,Premium price for poor service,"Flew from Newark to Dublin on board United's 787 Dreamliner in premium plus cabin. The cabin? Really nice. Bit like older style business. No complaints. However, the cabin crew were awful. It was as if it was their first day at work and without training. I was served a glass of wine in a plastic glass while there was a glass wine glass on my table tray. I ordered pasta which was dried out and cold when served. I had to hit the call button 3 times over a period of 30mins to get any attention. And when I did get the attention of a cabin crew member her response to my call was - And? Completely useless. Obviously they'd discussed my complaint among themselves as another came back about 1hr later asking if I would like them to check in business class for a meal.  You'd think United would have the crews trained to provide the type of service you're paying for in each cabin section.  Generally I travel a lot with United. Their customer service is faultless and generally the cabin crew are helpful. But on this occasion they were useless.  I reported all of this in a customer survey but to date nothing has come back from United. Goes to show how much attention they pay to customer surveys."
Nov 2019,50,United is great,"I fly for business and leisure and mostly on United. Flights are on time overall, planes are in good shape, and the flight attendants are always friendly and willing to help. I am a 1k member and they take good care of me"
Nov 2019,30,United airlines seats,"Just fine on this flight. No problems. I just don’t like not being assigned a seat until check in. It’s coercing people to pay extra. I refuse to do it. After all, you know you have a seat."
Nov 2019,40,Delayed but Good,"We arrived at the IAH airport 2 hours early for our flight to Cancun just before the early morning storm. While going through check-in the storms got worse and I heard over the intercom system someone from IAH saying the runways were temporary closed. Due to weather we were 30 minutes late boarding our flight. Once we got on the United Airplane we waited on the run way over an hour because several flights were ahead of us waiting for clearance for departure. Most people were upset and getting restless but the UA stewardess and captain were all very informational and got us to our destination ASAP without any more delays, great job UA airlines"
Nov 2019,30,If you are looking for anything special this is not your airline..,"They have managed to make the aisles so narrow by adding extra seats that you are extremely lucky not to get bumped by the service cart when it goes down the aisle. When you have boarded the plane and are seated in economy/aisle seat there is no way you can avoid getting bumped by the back packs or wide hipped passengers as they pass you when you are seated. Additionally, their idea of a reclining position is approximately 2""-3"". The public is getting fatter and the seats narrower. Pre-pay to check your bag and invariably they offer free check in when you are boarding the plane. There are zero refunds for those who have paid to check their bags."
Nov 2019,20,Sitting on cardboard,4 hours of sitting sucks. Had to crank up the air since it was so stuffy. Felt like sitting on a hard surface. Good thing i was super tired. Slept some. Good thing they had refreshments and snack. It kills time. No tv. You got to download their app before getting on the flight. Space for luggage was tight. Friend had to check in hers. Mine barely fit!. Small plane just 4 seats per row. But we landed safely. That is what counts.
Nov 2019,40,Nice aisle seat,"I had an aisle seat on this long overseas flight. About every three hours I went for a walk up the aisle to stretch my legs. Cabin crew seemed somewhat indifferent, not overly friendly. On-board meals were standard economy, nothing special."
Nov 2019,50,Uneventful,"No issues.  We were in business class and the flight attendants were attentive and responsive. We are not demanding or needy travelers, so, it's all good. The food was not that great. It could have been better for business class.  Had issues with wifi - almost not worth it for a short 4-hour flight.  One thing I will suggest is that if you are going to ask me to put my items away, be consistent and ask other travelers to do the same. We were on Row 1 and I had a small purse by my feet. The other travelers on same row had their laptop bags by their feet, too. The FA only asked me to put my stuff away."
Nov 2019,40,Nice experience,"Flew from Chicago to Sacramento. The flight was on an A320, and I was in Economy Plus.    It was a nice flight. Although it had older (and smaller) overhead bins, the plane was in nice condition, with fresh looking seats, etc. The seat could have used a little more padding, but the legroom was very comfortable (I was pleased to have paid for Economy Plus). Everything was clean. In-flight entertainment was not available. I did not try the WiFi.    Service on-board was attentive. There were a couple of full rounds of beverage service, as well as water and coffee service in-between. The flight attendants were polite. Heftier food (including hot items, like a burger) was available for sale; for free, you had a choice of pretzels, cookies, or a stroopwaffel (yum).    Baggage delivery in Sacramento was timely.    Overall, a solid experience."
Nov 2019,50,United? It was Okay,"United has been getting a bad rap from both American and International travelers over the last few years, but my flight aboard a Dreamliner was just fine. The cabin staff was friendly, and happy, and the food choices appeared good and pricing was acceptable. The seats and seat pitch was okay for an Economy section, and the flight left and arrived on time. No hassle with check-in and the on-board enterainment choices were very good. Based on this flight I would use United again - but not if you listen to its many critics. Your choice."
Nov 2019,30,Don't Argue In The Aisle. Unprofessional,"Was traveling for a destination wedding. Flight boarded on time and process was smooth. We pushed back from gate on time but were 19th in line for takeoff so that took awhile. It was just a busy time. We were told our flt would be over water and that there would be turbulence for about the first hour which meant attendants would have to be seated - no problem as we understood the safety reason. Once they were able to be up in the cabin there were so many people lined up for the restroom that beverage service was severely delayed. What was unpleasant was there was one attendant who was being argumentative with another about how many rows she had to take care of. Keep your problems away from the passengers. Her attitude was as nasty as I have ever witnessed. When my friend asked for more than one snack (a cookie) because she was shaky from low blood sugar the same attendant said she would give it to her THIS TIME but normally would not. This one particular attendant was the only one I had a problem with. If you are not suited to this career maybe you should choose another one. I did not get her name, otherwise I would include in this review."
Nov 2019,10,"Unclean, unfriendly, unprofessional, and disgusting!","The flight was delayed. After boarding, we had to wait half an hour for the weather to clear at destination. We were told we could use the restroom. I tried doing so, but the stench and grossness on the bathroom floor prevented me from using it, it was absolutely filthy. I mentioned it to the flight attendant who told me there was nothing she could do and that's why there are restrooms in the terminal. That was rude, unprofessional, and downright insulting. We will not fly United again."
Nov 2019,50,"CRYING, UNRULY BABIES IN 1st CLASS!","Why do vapid, emotionally selfish, young and inexperienced parents find it necessary to subject others to the loud crying of their ""precious"" off spring? Has it ever occurred to them to tell their child to be quiet?    Has it ever occurred to that that some of us might actually enjoy a quiet and relaxing experience while flying?    Also, why do those flying ""Economy Class"" insist on using the 1st Class Bathroom?"
Nov 2019,40,Easy flight Dulles to San Antonio,Nice flight to San Antonio. Left on time and arrived on time. Baggage came quickly. Service good and a very smooth ride. Breakfast served was very good. Only downside was no entertainment in first class. It's hit or miss on United in the US these days even on coast to coast flights.
Nov 2019,50,Transatlantic Flight,"When I've traveled transatlantic in recent years, my best experiences have been with United. Service Comfort Seat TV system easiest to use and figure out Ontime"
Nov 2019,40,"Got the job done, overall flying experience rarely a true pleasure","No complaints besides the usual stressful zoo that the processes required to get one onto the plane entails. Nothing done wrong by United- just a circus at a busy busy place like EWR. and it is an expensive flight, direct to Key West, that we chose to save time of connecting flights, it is what it is. Lucky we could do it!"
Nov 2019,40,Squishy little plane,"A short flight is a short flight. Planes are getting smaller, seats are getting smaller, basic comforts are getting less and less.  But for a 2.5 hr flight, it was fine. The attendant was friendly, we were given a little baggy of snacks and a beverage.  However, with technology as it is, there should no longer be flights over an hour that doesn't offer the ability to plug in your handheld, and there should be SOMETHING to watch for those who don't stream on their teeny little smartphones.  I did bring an iPad to play some games, my soduko book and my word find book to occupy my flight, but some luxuries would be appreciated even on a smaller plane :)"
Nov 2019,50,Great service,This is our first time trying out a direct flight to States from Singapore. We normally would go for a transit in Japan. Surprised that the flight was so smooth and pleasant. We save few hours and arrived at destination for a good rest before we start on a new day.
Nov 2019,50,Great flight,"The flight left on time and arrived early. We were fed two meals, plus snacks, and the flight attendants were very good. The flight itself was smooth and uneventful , and even the in- flight movies were current and entertaining."
Nov 2019,40,Flight 88...Lucky Chinese numbers,"Seat comfort and space were average. Flight was long, and hard to sleep in economy, as seats are close together and the person beside me was always moving. Flight attendants were pleasant and attentive. Being a Gold member of Star Alliance, I got advanced boarding which gave me a chance to store my things."
Nov 2019,50,Long flight!,"Long flight, OK seats and snacks - typical flight these days. The attendents were excellent and the flight was as good as it gets."
Nov 2019,30,Cattle Car Flight,"The flight over to Maui was not the best. The plane was old, no electronics and minimal service. Not ""The Royal Hawaiian Service"" they used to have. Would have had a better flight on Southwest."
Nov 2019,40,Prompt and courteous,Flights are always on time and staff is caring. We were flying into a bad storm and had to route to another airport to wait out the weather. The crew stuck with it and we arrived late but safely.
Nov 2019,20,Check-in Hassle,"Because I travel to a vacation home, I fly with the allowed 1 personal item, no need for a checked bag. Their policy does not allow you to check-in online if you don't check a bag. You're instructed to get a boarding pass at a kiosk, but after standing in line for one, I was then instructed to wait for an agent, which involved another line, where I had to again prove that my tiny bag was within size limits. I'm 68, approved for TSA pre-check. The flight itself was unremarkable, but as others have said, the leg room is minimal. The small plane from Denver to Durango is more spacious."
Nov 2019,30,Bored!,There was no entertainment on to watch. for such a long flight it was awful. I am visually impaired and cannot us my iPhone or such. Will not take that flight again.
Nov 2019,50,Great trip but dear lord the child,Flight was easy and not very full at and that worked out since there was a screaming kid the whole time. when I say the whole time the entire flight a child was screaming.
Nov 2019,40,Great Flight. Great Service,United kinda won me back! Everything was awesome! They let me sit in a upgraded seat. That was nice since I only had a basic economy ticket. I'm 6-5 so I was lovving that!
Nov 2019,20,Indifferent service,"Paid $$$ for upgrade to Premium Economy. Extra legroom was nice but seats rather hard and narrow. Cookie or pretzel?? Seriously....on a 5-6 hour flight?? Witnessed the food available for purchase...embarrassing. A burger in a bag. Guy who ate it declared it nasty. FAs were rather sullen and withdrawn. They hid in the galley most of the time gossiping. I get it...it's often a thankless job but there are other lines of work available if you're that miserable. You could respond when passengers smile and thank you for what little service they're getting. Prisoners get more attention. Welcome to the Unfriendly Skies. My, how things have changed!!"
Nov 2019,50,What a pleasant flight,The service was commendable. My wife needs a whhelchair)to and from the plane). The waiting was minimal. The plane was clean. The check-ins were pleasant. The staff was great. The flight was early.
Nov 2019,10,Oh My goodness! Here We go again!!! This major incident airline,"I checked in at Honolulu International Airport, which was good, but when I decided to buy food at the airport and bring it onboard the B764, I was forced not to by the employees at the front of the departure gate! The employee also forced me to not eat at the airport before boarding the flight. I don't know what's wrong with United. United maybe is trying to force me to be hungry unless if I pay for meals onboard. United is a monster and illegal airline due to the customer service and the inflight service. The inflight service didn't include any complimentary meals, only complimentary snack. I can only purchase meals if wanted to, otherwise I'm not allowed to eat anything like the food I decided to bring on board besides the inflight complimentary snacks. Finally, United is an incident and illegal airline due to the terrible customer service and inflight service."
Nov 2019,50,My Second Favorite Airline,"I would fly United more, but since moving from Houston to Central Florida, the flights just aren't as convenient out of Orlando unless of course you are flying to one of United's Hubs. Planes are well maintained and flight attendents are courteous."
Nov 2019,50,DFW to Boston,"I've always had good luck with United. The flight to Boston was as expected. We arrived a little early and had no issues. The return flight was the same, early arrival into DFW."
Nov 2019,20,Sardines in a can,Don't skimp when it comes to United or you'll pay for it. Seats that don't recline. One choice of a cookie or pretzels. Never will pick them again.
Nov 2019,30,It was great especially to disabled veterans,There we're no usb ports to charge electronics. But they went over and beyond helping disabled veterans. Great staff!
Nov 2019,20,Terrible,"start your vacation without flighting with United Airline they are going to cancelled your flight without telling you and they will apologize for it but they will take your money, this airline left me in another country, I have to buy another ticket to get to the United State. Avoid flighting with this airlines. United Airline's the worse."
Nov 2019,10,THE WORSE,"United Airlines is the worse airlines I ever used, this airlines cancelled my flight without sent me an email or call me to tell me about it, I went to Dominican Republic with them and they left me there in a foreign country that I did not know anything about it and when i came to the US and I called the airlines all they say was I am sorry we cannot give you your money back they took $ 245.00 dollars from me. DON'T USE THIS AIRLINES. United only take people money."
Nov 2019,50,A1 super um,We were very impressed with United service. We flew their inaugural flight from Melbourne to San Francisco (using inflight wifi) and we are so rapt with everything from check in to the comfort of our seats (although the recline was not really a recline.. my only complaint). United's Customer service at check in and in flight (particularly Steve) was exceptional and omg the special certificate and pen and cupcakes and treats were unreal and unexpected. We were so thrilled to be on this flight and felt so lucky.
Nov 2019,20,Will never fly United out of Newark again,the process of checking in at the kiosk then to a customer rep and then through TSA - ridiculous. The old adage you get what you pay for is surely that of United. I will stick with my standby airline JetBlue no matter what the expense is for flying.
Nov 2019,50,Michelle the flight attendant,"Our trip from cancun to houston was wonderful, our connecting trip to lga was even better thanks to a beautiful soul on the plane by the name of michelle there needs to be more flight attendant who actually attend to people the way she does, we thought we would have a rough trip because they announced one of the pilots called out right before take off lol hope hes ok!

Nov 2019,50,United Airlines Economy Plus,"United Airlines, is a large airline, serving more cities around the world than any other carrier! It was a pleasure riding in premium economy, clean, efficient, and plenty of amenities. I highly recommend United Airlines!"
Nov 2019,40,More pleasant than usual...,"This overnight flight was more pleasant than usual, probably because we slept most of the way, and we had a bit more legroom, as we paid to upgrade."
Nov 2019,20,No entertainment system???????,"In this day in age, I am surprised that a coast to coast United flight, across North America, would not have an installed entertainment system accessible on the seat back of the seat in front of you. United wants you to use a downloadable app and watch you shows and movies on your phone.    On the other hand, the bathroom at the back of the plane seemed larger than usual and was clean."
Nov 2019,40,Uneventful flight from ATL to IAD in firs,Flight left on time and arrived early. Baggage arrived quickly. Fastest departure from airport service n recent memory. Friendly service even though all seats were full. Worth buying a first class ticket
Nov 2019,40,Good packed flight to Atlanta,"Good flight to Atlanta. Completely packed flight with airline asking for volunteers to give up seats but we were comfortable in First Class. Service ok, seats comfortable and flight was on time as was baggage. What more could we ask for. A good reason to fly first class even on a short flight."
Nov 2019,40,Polaris Class is Good - Just Wished the Food was Better,"We flew Business Class from London Heathrow to Houston on an afternoon flight. We arrived 35 minutes early so that was great.    Our plane was a 777. Originally the configuration was not Polaris seating. But to our surprise, when we checked our seats a couple of days before our flight, we noticed the Polaris seating. This was a nice surprise. The Polaris config is MUCH better than the old config where the seats are out in the wide open.    Dinner and a light snack was serviced during the quick 9 hour flight. Food was mediocre as usual. I've never had a great meal on a UA flight.    However, I always enjoy the Business Class amenities. 2 blankets, 2 pillows with 1 being memory foam, soft slippers. UA has one of the best blankets and pillows out there. I will have to give them that. Also, the seat was comfortable. Got great sleep.    In Heathrow, we were also invited to the VIP Lounge. I believe this is reserved for Global Services but they let us go into this Lounge and it was quiet and you can order off a menu."
Nov 2019,50,Smooth trip,"Smooth sailing, not a problem, it was great to fly with United and book thru Expedia, I flew with 2 90 year old ladies, we did not have luggage to worry about and we only had a personal item to carry on. Not bad at all, would definitely fly this way again."
Nov 2019,40,New United Premium Plus,"The Premium plus is not Premium economy. It's a middle thing between Premium economy and business. There are only 3 rows on the B777-200, so make sure to upgrade or purchase in time because this is a bargain.    On the plus side:  + Great seats with plenty of adjustment  + Great leg room, being 180cm I could stretch out fully without compromise.  + Great infotainment with all the latest movies, even those still running on cinema. Of course you had 100+ series, tv-channels, games and so on.  + The food was good, especially being on an airline.    - Economy passengers trying to steal your overhead compartment space  - Weird place to plug in your complimentary noise cancelling headset.  - Nice to get a pillow and blanket from Saks 5th avenue, but where to store them if you dont need them?    All in all, worth every penny if you want more space, better service and food than economy on trans-continental flights."
Nov 2019,20,1K means nothing,I’ve been a loyal flyer for years and I’m quickly loosing it. I paid to use a United Club lounge waiting for a red eye flight home only to be kicked out less then 30min later because it was midnight - why a 1K Business class flyer has to pay extra for a seat waiting for a late flight is a mystery. I guess United can claim “we suck less” but they are about to lose a 1K flyer. I’ll use 2020 to achieve the status I have with United already on another airline.
Nov 2019,10,No need to get a United Mileage Credit Card,"United Airlines has changed dramatically over the years. I did see a tremendous change in employee attitudes for the worst when they took over Continental Air.    Now there is another terrible change. I am a MileagePluS member and have been one for over a decade. I loyally purchase my air from United, go to the United Club, and enjoy other benefits. But I purchased a package deal to Cabo from IAH, with my MileagePluS card. Little did I realize that I could not carry onboard a standard carry-on. It must be checked, paid for as standard luggage, plus an admin fee. Fortunately, I read about this in advance.    In retrospect, United has become a budget airline with non-budget prices, much like Ryan Air or Spirit Air. Skip the aggravation and fly friendly Southwest Air instead."
Nov 2019,20,Packed in like sardines with wings,"Boked with 2 plus weeks to go before flight and paid an arm and a leg compared to a collegue that booked 3 days before and got better seats and cheaper price.    DONT kid your self, there is very little room for a carry on and there is no room for the standard overhead compartment.    Bring your running shoes to get to your next gate. I talked to a gate agent and they said they plan them tight and hope that half the people make it on the flight. Not impressed.    Motivator 535"
Nov 2019,50,easy,"In general it pays to pay business class. Important to find the right connecting airport, and it depends of the time of the year."
Nov 2019,10,Never use United Airlines. Delta much better,"This airline was awful for several reasons: they were disorganized (lost our luggage), they weren’t compassionate (only 1 nursing room in the entire ORD airport and no place to go), and they were awful at communicating (how do your pilots not know until they take off that a runway is closed??).    Because of this combination of incompetence, we were at ORD with our 1 year old for 14 hours. Had they just told us to stay home or communicated realistically and clearly the situation, many people could have stayed home, instead of braving the icy roads and being stuck at the airport.    I will never fly united again. Do yourself a favor and pick another airline."
Nov 2019,30,"United, flying with people who are ill.","My husband and I usually fly with United. Air travel has its good points and bad points. The good, flight was on time, staff very pleasant and helpful, airline food is airline food no great shakes there, great list of programs/movies to watch.  The not so good. This issue can happen on any airline. I just experienced it on United. Please if the check in staff sees/hears a person hacking up their lungs in the waiting area before a flight maybe it is a good idea to see what kind of sickness that person has, if they have a fever, contagious! A lady coughed non stop in the waiting gate area. I had the luck of sitting in front of her on the flight. She coughed for most of the flight back to NJ. 10 days later I get sick. I'm on day 10 fighting this germ she passed on to me. WHY was this person allowed to spew her germs to the hundreds of people on that flight? Luckily I will get well from this. I'm not to sure about an older person or a child. I hope the sick woman has recovered. IMO a sick contagious person should not be allowed on a flight. Wear a face mask. Do something so the rest of the passengers are not infected as well. For the well being of all there should be a rule that sick contagious people cannot not fly."
Nov 2019,30,Still less than I expected,"Same aircraft type as outbound flight but ever so slightly newer, this one had movie screen in seat back, but had to ask for ear buds. could not control start time of movie.  Food choice again extremely limited. I had Thai Noodles with Chicken, wife had cobb salad with chicken. Mine was not as appealing as a Stauffers individual entree. My wife had cold chicken with her salad, couldnt eat it at all. Very minimal amenities for first class."
Nov 2019,10,Luggage issues,"My flight from Chicago to Denver was delayed 4.5 hours. Somehow my clothes made it to Denver before me. I waited at the luggage carousel until all the bags were off my flight before heading to the United luggage counter at about 11:30PM. I was told that my bag was in a secure area and that it would take 4 hours to retrieve it. I chose to leave my luggage at the airport and head to the hotel instead of waiting until 3:30AM for my bag and then leaving. This morning as I am checking in with another airline their workers agreed with me that it was a matter of laziness rather than logistics. Unfortunately this experience has discouraged me from flying United. We also sat on the runway for almost an hour, 45 minutes + in Chicago last night. I will be following up with United, but I only expect the run of the mill BS. It’s so sad that as a traveler this is what has come to be expected instead of out of the norm. Join together TripAdvisor citizens and change our expectations of what travel should be."
Nov 2019,30,limited amenities in 1rst Class,"3.5hr flight, lunch was mac and cheese, no choices  drink service was very limited  NO Movie, No earbuds for even music, shocking considering the price.  Seat cushions totally worn out. Cieling paint flaking and dirty appearing.    737-800/900 but appeared much older, not confidence inspiring. Really an old member of their fleet."
Nov 2019,20,dissapointing,"Basic economy is just that basic, if you are traveling with family expect to be seated separately.    Staff, and flight attendants were amazing    However due to an error in scanning of boarding pass, my 15 year old daughter was removed from the reservation I had to spend a while on the phone, while a Disneyland, getting her put back into the return flight, they ended up creating a whole NEW reservation. Not a good experience."
Nov 2019,40,Comfortable flight even though duration was 12 hours,The flight was full but nonetheless very comfortable. The movie selection was good and the airline crew were very nice. The food selection was not great but I guess what do you expect on airlines!
Nov 2019,10,The worst,My original flight was scheduled 30 hours ago and I am still waiting.... This has been the worst experience and the worst part of all... it’s not over
Nov 2019,30,Poor ticketing advice,"We are dedicated UA flyers. We booked this Nov. 7th trip in early September. The ticketing agent encouraged my husband to wait-list for an upgrade saying there were over 25 unsold seats and she thought we would have a good chance for an upgrade which he was willing to secure at that time with miles/fees. We always secure our upgrades to/from on international flights to ensure a comfortable journey. Needless to say, all but 1 seat sold before our flight and we were way down the wait-list. We were told by an agent at Heathrow that Thursdays were near impossible for wait-list to the US as it's a very popular travel day to SFO. Moral to the story, we will continue to be loyal to UA, we will use our own instincts for booking."
Nov 2019,20,Unfriendly Terminal in Newark,"The Dreamliner has some great features, but the leg room between the very expensive Premium Economy seats is smaller than that of other United crafts. The food was absolutely inedible both ways - I would recommend to bring your own!    Now this part of the review refers to Terminal C in Newark Liberty, which services United exclusively, therefore I feel it belongs here:  As we all know, no bottled water are allowed beyond security. The prices for buying them post TSA check points are outrageously high (not to mention that buying disposable bottles is very un-eco-friendly), therefore most other terminals I've been to around the US and abroad have bottle-filling stations next to water fountains. Not so for the newly renovated United terminal in Newark (terminal C); One must settle for filling reusable bottles at the regular water fountains, which is almost impossible and unhygienic!  Furthermore, for some inexplicable reason, most of the seats are attached to the floor next to tables, without the possibility of moving them, making it utterly impossible to sit down comfortably, or having a child in your lap, or simply being a little less agile. The number of available seats that are not within a foot and a half from a table is very limited."
Nov 2019,50,Fantastic flight,"Another excellent trip with UAL. Treated my Mom to Polaris, She loved it. The very comfortable lie flat seats allowed us to rest up and hit the ground running when we arrived. The meals were okay, breakfast was better then dinner, wine selection outstanding and the flight crew was top notch and professional. Highly recommended and will for sure do it again"
Nov 2019,50,United Exceeded Expectations,"Alright, look, I love flying. I mean, I LOVE flying. I will sit on a plane for 17, 18, 20 hours...I love the feeling of flying. That being said, long haul flights can be tough if the service is awful. I recently flew from Newark to Hong Kong on United's new 777-300ER.    Let me start this off by saying, I immediately followed this flight on a Singapore Airlines flight, on a similar 777-300.    That being said, I will fly United economy on their newer aircraft over most airlines hands down. The leg space on United economy was actually better than SQ economy.    Now obviously, SQ is known for their 5-star service, and that remains unparalleled, however, United crew was absolutely brilliant in their duties. Furthermore, the United crew was courteous, helpful and friendly on the long haul journey.    Yes, the food and entertainment wasn't up to the same par as SQ, but the staff more than made up for it."
Nov 2019,50,United accommodations,"As a person which a disability, my profile states I need assistance walking long distances. When the plan was ready to load, a wheelchair service was available for me (without follow up). I don’t this is something that is done for first class only, but for all passengers. This shows a commitment to customers. I definitely use and will CM time to use United !!!"
Nov 2019,20,"""Basic Economy"" is not worth the savings","In the early 1900s when my ancestors came to the USA, they traveled in the steerage section on the ships (the lowest cost and class of travel). Basic Economy is United's modern take on steerage. You want to select a seat? That costs extra - from $15 to $29. $15 to sit near the lavatories, $29 for other seats. Note that these upgrades provide NO extra legroom. Why would anyone do this? Because you're not guaranteed you can sit with your party unless you pay to select a seat. We saw this yesterday - a woman and her *two year old* were given seats nowhere near each other (luckily, for as awful as United is, passengers are better - someone switched seats so this woman could be with her - I'll say it again - *two year old*). Carry-ons? Forget about it - you get one personal item, not to exceed 9"" x 10"" x 17"". Mine was maybe an inch over, but I received no hassle about it - probably because United's employees are likely embarrassed at the money-grubbing policies of their employer. The seating is terrible. As a steerage...um, I mean Basic Economy...passenger, you're the last to board. No biggie - you can't use the overhead bins anyway. The seat offers 16-17"" in width and a pitch of 30-31"" (this is from United's website). Cramped and uncomfortable. By contrast, Jet Blue Economy has seats 18"" wide with a pitch of 33"". Early check in? Forget about it. You have to check in at the gate (unless you check a bag, then you can do it early). As for the amenities, you get a very good selection of in-flight entertainment (bring your own headphones), and a free snack (think a cookie or biscotti) and drink. Wireless can be purchased if you want it. Surprisingly, Basic Economy passengers are permitted to use the lavatories. The use of the lavs is easiest if you're short, very skinny, and are an amateur contortionist (note that this state of affairs is not unique to United). United crew and gate staff was friendly enough  Summary: don't do it! You may thing you're saving money, but you're not. You'll need to check all luggage ($30 for the first, $40 for the second, and $150 - yes, $150 - for the third). If you want to sit next to your companions, $15-$29 per person. After these fees, you can get more comfort and a better price on other carriers. Basic Economy is a cynical cash grab, and United's so-far winning entry in the ""race to the bottom"" for passenger comfort and convenience. Did I sign up for this willingly? Yes (although Priceline went to no pains to highlight all of the heinous restrictions). So, it's my own fault.  To United: fool me once, shame on me. You ain't gonna get a chance to fool me twice. Buh-bye."
Nov 2019,20,Business Class seats - Economy experience,"This is only the third time I've flown Business Class. Previously I flew Singapore and Virgin, both of which were amazing. This wasn't. UAs Business Class experience feels like somebody in charge asked 'What's the least we can get away to call this Business Class?' and went with that. The food was straight out of economy (in fact it was worse than Virgin's economy menu) and I went hungry rather than eating it. The decor was corporate and soulless, and to be honest - so were the staff. They were all ageing Stepford librarians. It was weird. I mean, don't get me wrong; I'm not saying they should have been young and spritely. But everyone and everything just felt a bit...tired. The seats were comfy, I'll give them that. It's just a shame they were in an economy cabin. Not worth the money."
Nov 2019,10,They don’t serve food they starve people for 8+ hours,"I’ve flown many many times on many different airlines around the world and hands-down United was the WORST experience! I was in shock when I found out that they don’t serve food on an 8+ hour flight!! So they have a menu where you can buy food, but here comes the kicker, they don’t bring enough food on the plane for all the passengers, everything was sold out! And on one of the flights they just served chips, this one was a 5 hour flight, I was prepared to order first before everything was sold out to find that they really had zero food available! I’ve got to say I’ve never flown a flight we’re there wasn’t food provided. Be prepared also because there are no TVs and the outlets barely work unless you physically hold your charger in the outlet the whole time! The flight attendants were giving me attitude when I asked about the food, most likely because they probably got asked the question from multiple passengers daily. I’m in utter shock the way United treats there passengers, if your not first class you’re nothing actually first class more so resembles economy on regular flights. They do under the bare minimum for their passengers, I will never give this company another dime of my money, fly any other airline but this one! It’s worth the extra $50 you save TRUST ME"
Nov 2019,50,Every fight going and coming was on time,United favors both my wife and me with priority 2 boarding UNLIKE ANY other airline we fly. I don't know why-perhaps because we're both in our mid-70's or perhaps because I'm a member of United Mileage plus.
Nov 2019,10,Will never fly United again!!!!,90 minutes in the plane. No water but passengers told they were waiting for the co-pilot. They decided to cancel the flight and now everyone is stuck in the airport for at least 24 hours. Their Passenger Assistance Mgr. refused to assist with accommodation and claims it was the weather and not because we didn't have a co-pilot so there would be no compensation. Will NEVER touch this airline with a 10 foot pole ever again.
Nov 2019,40,"Easy, On Time","I flew United right before Labor Day Weekend from SFO to PDX and even though it was a busy travel weekend, travel was fairly seamless. Flights were on time, boarding was easy, and the flight was good. While United's app for in-flight entertainment is a little less convenient than seat-back screens (I've found that I can rarely log on and watch movies), for such a short flight, it didn't matter. Staff was friendly, and I'd fly with them again."
Nov 2019,20,Customer service at Newark ATROCIOUS,"I am not one to be critical of a company or people, especially working in a customer service industry. I give people benefit of the doubt most of the time until given reason not too. But...    Today was one day. From the get go, checking in, bag drop, and at the gate the customer service was short, dismissive, and unknowledgeable past the phrases “I’ll have to ask my partner/superior” and “the system is malfunctioning”. Any question I had I was passed to the next person or the next stop (you’ll have to see the agent at the gate counter when it was a flight question that they have the same computer system too.    The service is run by humans, I get it, and the airport is busy. But having politeness and aggressiveness to ensure travelers know what’s happening, or checking a request would go a long way in making the company look better and make themselves look better."
Nov 2019,20,Poor,There is little I can say about this flight that was  Good. Movie choice was okay. Food was aweful. Literally the worst plane food ever. The cabin crew in economy were grumpy and miserable. Seats were okay and were the reason this is 2 not 1. Flight was on time as well.
Nov 2019,20,Long delay in San Francisco,After a long flight from Iceland and 4 hours wait in the airport we finally got on board the flight to Las Vegas. However when everything was ready the pilot announced that there has to be a count on passengers on board. The delay was for more than an hours in the airplane just around midnight. Flight that should have been 1 hours and 20 min was about 2 hours and 30 min.
Nov 2019,40,Vacation,Flew United Airlines from Toronto to Lihue Hawaii by way of Denver on the way there and SAN Francisco on the way home.  Staff were all friendly and helpful. I am a taller person and the economy seats are very tight. We upgraded our seats on the longer legs of our trip. The extra leg room was a huge difference. I find it odd that because of my height I have to pay a priming to be comfortable. I know this is a United Airline issue but an industry wide issue.  Overall the trip was good.
Nov 2019,50,Best flight prices from Texas to the Pacific Northwest,"Had to make a quick trip home, had to grab a quick ticket the day prior to flight. Went on Exp**** and Travel***** and Cheapo*** and the best price I found was $441. I logged into my UA portal and got a ticket for $167.00. Unreal. I have begun to fly UA almost exclusively as a result of excellent pricing and the excellent level of customer service I get each time I fly. Virtually every time I have flown, the pilot himself has stood in the doorway and thanked me for flying. My favorite connection is in Denver, I cannot stress how good the UA staff at the Denver airport is. 6 stars o a 5 star level - they haven't let me down in the last 9 flights I have made - not late one single time."
Nov 2019,30,Airline Travel Ain't What It Used to Be,"Flight a bit delayed out of Moline. Late arriving in Denver to catch the San Diego flight. Lucky that the San Diego flight was delayed so made the connection.    Cramped seats - I think the FAA should investigate to see if in an emergency passengers can safely deplane - and flight attendants in different uniforms.    The aircraft, a Boeing 737-800 was quiet which was a plus from those ""almost an airliner"" AirBus."
Nov 2019,30,Equipment problems,Our flight from Houston to Bonaire was delayed for over 5 hours. We boarded the plane and taxied toward the runway per the established schedule. We sat on the tarmac for over 30 minutes with no communications from the cockpit. We finally got in the air almost an hour late still with no communications. As soon as we got in the air the pilot finally decided to tell us that an instrument problems was returning us to Houston. We arrived back at the gate 2 hours after the scheduled departure time. We were told the problem would be corrected in 20 minutes. 30 minutes later we were told to deplane. We finally got underway over 5 hours late. The flight crew they called I informed us that the original pilot refused to fly the airplane and walked out of the airport. The flight was uneventful other than the prolonged delay. I got progress updates through the app on my phone. We were NOT offered free food or drinks on the trip. The flight crew provided 1 beverage service that consisted of a bottle of pop and 2 cookies. United offered us a $75 voucher for a future flight that expires in 1 year. I cannot understand the lack of communications and treatment from United. This is Not my favorite airline.
Nov 2019,50,Excellent Service,Good service. Easy mobile check in. Friendly staff. Comfortable clean cabin. On board food and drink adequate and good quality.
Nov 2019,10,Missed my first class flight seats,Due to a delay from Mexico to Houston we missed our flight out of Houston that I had purchased first class seats on they did not refund my first class seat upgrade and did not accommodate me at all on the standby flight later that night  After three weeks of fighting with customer service I’m trying to get at least a refund back on my first class seats that I never received I had to dispute my credit card in order to get my money back. United airlines is the worst airlines I’ve ever flew with
Nov 2019,40,First class room and food but not necessarily comfort,"Very roomy, food and beverages were good but the seat itself was not very comfortable. It felt very old and compressed! In flight entertainment was on a personal device only, luckily I had my iPad with me!"
Nov 2019,50,Great service from Houston to Tucson,"Our stewardess was very helpful, gracious and friendly, she made the trip perfect. As opposed to the stewardess on the flight from Tucson to Houston, not nice. Only conversation was ""what you like to drink"" then ""would you like a lite lunch""?? not friendly at all."
Nov 2019,50,Super staff,"Great staff on flight return after a long day in Israel! While some passengers were difficult the staff was kind, patient and complimented our group for exemplifying what travelers should be like."
Nov 2019,50,Great Flight - Arrived Early,Excellent flight - efficient boarding - arrived early. Medical emergency mid flight as handled quickly with a good outcome. Flight arrived 30 minutes early.
Nov 2019,40,Good experience,"All the attendants were very nice and EAGER to please us.  BUT the FOOD which was 2 meals was TERRIBLE. Please make it better. I know it is possible because we had GREAT food on a 17 hour flight from Dallas, Texas to Sydney Australia on Quantas. Try a NEW food Distributor. Also, a note for someone 6 foot and taller (which my husband is), the Reclining seat space was NOT long enough so he had to sleep on this 11 hour flight with his knees bent and there was NOT enough space between wall of plane and the console between seats to bend knees. Therefore, he could NOT recline seat enough to FULLY LAY FLAT. He did not get much sleep AND that was the PURPOSE of buying EXPENSIVE Business Class seats."
Nov 2019,40,It's so great to be treated like a human and not a number,"We had a tough flight ahead of us with my husband traveling with a broken neck from a body surfing accident while we were on vacation. We had never done this before- ordering wheelchairs and help at the gates and having to delay our return due to being in the hospital and booking another flight- plus my husband is 6'8"" tall so he's not comfortable in most airplanes when he's not injured let alone when he has an injury like this! Everyone was extremely helpful- down to the passenger who gave up his seat so that we had more room and could sit together. All in all- considering...it was a good trip with 2 flights and a 4 hour layover in LA- but at this point we are just grateful for every little thing in our life. It could all be so much worse- we feel extremely blessed. thank you!"
Nov 2019,20,Consider seriously before you book United Polaris,"My wife and I just flew from Louisville Kentucky to Athens round trip on United in business class. My advice is to seriously research your flights before you choose United. We flew in what they call Polaris Business Class. Flight 106 from Washington Dulles to Munich, Germany was on a 777. There are four seats across the middle in business class and we were there. There is absolutely NO SPACE to store any personal items at your seat. Don't even think about having room for a backpack at your seat in business class. I had to put my backpack overhead and when I needed medicine or if I wanted a book or my journal, get up and get it from overhead. A woman could not even keep a medium sized purse at her seat. The foot space is ridiculous. I wear a size 8 1/2 shoe so I don't have big feet. But both of my feet would NOT FIT in the foot well. The seat was comfortable and did fully recline, but when you have nowhere to put your feet, how are you supposed to sleep. On the return flight from Munich to Dulles on Flight 107 we were seated next to the window, but again there was no space. Again the foot well was too small for my feet. The food was good and plentiful. The entertainment selection was good. But overall, I cannot recommend booking business class on United."
Nov 2019,40,good flight,"it was alot cheaper than any Australian airline at the time we were booking and as we bought all our flights with United in the USA it was alot cheaper and flying from Australia with a party 5 you have to save where you can, i would fly with United again for sure."
Nov 2019,10,Will not fly united again,"Will NEVER fly United again. We had round trip tickets and the whole experience from our home airport to our final destination and back , regarding United, was a mess. From customer service to organization, it was unpleasant. I like to think we are reasonable people and understand that stuff happens but just to skim the surface of what went wrong... they over booked every flight, every one of our flights were delayed /late, decent customer service was non existant. So disappointed with our experience. Our flight attendants were very nice but overall I would say one star is being generous. We fly so frequently for both work and leisure and never again will fly united."
Nov 2019,40,Flight to Paris,Overall it was a good flight. We upgraded to economy plus for return flight. Food and service was good. The only negative was the bathrooms were more dirty and smelly on the way back home then on the first flight. No issues with internet and great entertainment options.
Nov 2019,30,Average flight experience using United,"I flew to Chicago from Kuala Lumpur in August 2019 using United Airlines. I booked the Business class flight and I got a relatively new flight UA7967 & UA78 and I loved the cabin space and the privacy it offered. Business-class passengers were entitled to use the business lounge which is very comfortable. They have good restroom services. However, I do not enjoy the customer service offered by UA air stewardess and the food range for vegetarians needs major improvement especially when the food was pre-ordered. Can also improve on their entertainments"
Nov 2019,10,Just fly another airline,"United consistently shows they are either incapable of or unwilling to provide quality service. I have come to expect delays when flying United, their seats are cramped, and their in-flight service is lacking."
Nov 2019,10,Claustrophobic people beware,"I’ve never sat on a more tiny airplane ever! I could hardly move or breath in that cramped seat. I took a red eye from Hawaii to San Francisco and I wanted to sleep a bit but couldn’t because I didn’t have an inch to myself. I’ve taken many flights in my life and could sleep on all of them but this one! Most airplanes I can bend over to get my purse but all I could do in this seat was bend a tiny bit before my head hit the seat in front of me. Other flights you can sleep with your head on the table in front of you if you choose but not in this one. I’m only 5’5 and I can’t even imagine how someone taller than me could take it. I’ve never been more claustrophobic than on my two flights on United airlines. Definitely will take Alaska or any other flight! Also, the airplane looked very old because there were old cigarette ashtrays! This means that it was built before 1990! That’s 20 years old!!!"
Nov 2019,10,Don’t unite,"never ever..... ever book with this airline.  They do not care, they do not understand the meaning of customer service.  All of your this is 100% true.  They also have NO communication with any other people in the organization.  You would be better off hitch hiking, the person picking you up will treat you better!"
Nov 2019,10,Edward Sherley-Price,"Flight was delayed from Heathrow by 9 hours. Terrible customer service and they sent me to Washington with a connecting flight. This was cancelled and they said tough. Stuck in Washington and have to fly the next day economy, even though I have a business ticket. Stay away from United Airlines..!!"
Nov 2019,10,United has the worst customer services hands down,I don't know what it is with United. I keep giving them another chance and always end up with the same poor customer service attitude among the flight attendants. They seem very unhappy with their jobs and look at customers like a burden. I would fire every one of them and start over.
Nov 2019,30,"United's Boeing 737-800: ""And I'm Telling You, I'm Not Going""","(With apologies to Jennifers Holiday and Hudson.) Flew to Fort Lauderdale from Newark on Jet Blue and back on United's Boeing 737-800. The cramped seat situation was misery, and an hour into the flight, I had decided that as long as I had an alternative, I wouldn't fly on that plane again.    I am 5'9"", so not that tall. And the aisle seat supports are bolted to the floor in such a way that the space for your feet is also very narrow while there is quite a lot of foot room (but of course no more legroom) for the middle seat.    The plane looked shiny and new; the flight attendants were pleasant; they handed out complimentary earbuds; there was a package of cookies involved; but...nope.    I make three or four trips a year on a United Express flight, a little Embrayer jet that's not much more than a flying tin can, and that flight is pretty miserable. But it's the only way to get where I'm going. But for other flights I make, I won't be riding on United's Boeing 737-800 anymore if I have a choice."
Nov 2019,10,United is the worst US Carrier (way worse than Frontier),"This flight was from EWR to HNL. It was about 10-11 hours. The inflight service was extremely extremely extremely extremely unusual because there were no complimentary meals in economy class even though this flight is very long. Another bad thing was a United employee said I'm not allowed to bring any food onboard (not even chips in a carry on) even if I didn't want to purchase meals on board. The flight attendant said I had to pay $1000000 dollars for the inflight meal on this 10 hour flight to Honolulu. In conclusion, since I didn't want to pay for the inflight meal, a flight attendant and the UA employees in the EWR Terminal C said to me that I can't bring any food on board this flight (not even snacks like chips), because UA wanted to make me hungry no matter what. Oh, and one more thing, I was also told by a UA employee that I was not allowed to eat at any restaurant at the EWR Airport before I boarded the plane. The flight attendants were forcing me to only pay for meals onboard no matter I wanted to bring my own food or not, otherwise I was forced to be super super super super super super hungry during the whole flight."
Nov 2019,40,"Great crew, typical cramped seating","The crew was attentive and professional. The flight was smooth and uneventful. Since my husband is 6'4"" tall, sitting in any airline seat is less than comfortable. People taller than average should not be forced to pay much higher fees to sit comfortably. What was really difficult to understand was that the comfort seats on this flight were actually narrower than the economy seats, although had 2"" more leg room. United Airlines was on schedule and provided a good choice for entertainment on a long flight."
Nov 2019,30,Could be Better,"Flew Polaris Business-First. Lounge experience in Newark Excellent but went downward from there. Although the aircraft was a beautiful new 787-10 which is state-of-the-art in all respects, it was not really clean when boarded as litter from previous passengers ws not completely cleared away. Service was not particularly good and food was not up to standard and not nearly as good as in years past..some of it was hardly edible although the sundae ice cream dessert was up to par. We also found the business compartment to be rather cramped and seating controls were awkward. The flight was uneventful and smooth,"
Nov 2019,20,United Vacations-Impossible to get customer service,"This is meant as a review of UNITED VACATIONS, which is distinct from United Airlines. Although it is telling that a review for United Vacations apparently defaults to United Airlines. UAL should divorce itself from UV, because use of United's name by UV puts a blemish on UAL's name.  Customer service is non existent. I literally spent over five hours, most of which was on hold, to address a simple issue. You simply cannot get a customer service representative on the phone. On more than one occasion, I waited for over one hour on hold, only to finally give up and hang up.  I wrote complaints only to get canned responses about how they were working to improve their system, or that unusual weather caused heavy phone traffic. Sorry, but every travel service has to encounter these circumstances, and I have never, ever experienced such terrible service from any other travel service.  United Vacations therefor has severe internal problems which it needs to correct, if it can. Do not use them unless you are assured that you will get prompt service if you need it.  I would give them zero stars, except that our vacation itself was enjoyable. But, considering the awful service, next time I am using another travel site, quite frankly, even if it costs me a little more.  And UAL - this is also on you for allowing the United name to be used by them."
Nov 2019,20,Typical United Airlines Obnoxious Customer Treatment,"In the past, we have been mistreated by UAL staff on many flights. We had vowed never to fly with them again, and even cancelled our Mileage Plus credit card. When I made our reservations, I thought it was with ANA, not knowing that the flight was managed by United. While the flight was safe, and even left on time, it was typically cramped (we're small stature people), very little leg room, and very loud engine noise. The food was non-discript, presented poorly, and tasteless. Attendants were polite, and business-like, and that's OK. The next trip will be with any other airline than United."
Nov 2019,40,Ist time with United,"Went united all the way to Tampa via Newark on outbound and Houston on return. Excellent aircraft. On time. In fact landed Newark 30 mins early. and on return to London from Houston arrived 45 mins early. The Newark and Houston hubs facilates are excellent. Immigration and onward baggage collection direct from customs good.  On-board crew very friendly, plenty of water given out.  We found the food out and especially the return from Houston the best airline food we have had in years. We liked the the ice cream outbound and sorbet return.  Internet available if paid for. Unlike Delta they did not offer free limited internet with unrestricted free social media such as facebook messenger.  Although it looks further to travel the Houston London flight ls less than 8 hours. It takes that long from Atlanta.  Only 2 hours flight from Tampa to Houston. Only let down, at Houston, long walk from arrival concourse to shuttle train to get us to international terminal. Plus long walk to gate from shuttle.  Thumbs up to United."
Nov 2019,50,28 Day Duty to Texas,"My trip to El Paso was great going and returning back home. I was a little nervous about delays on my return because of my last trip with bad weather (September), but everything was smooth. The flight attendants were always very polite in greeting everyone entering and departing. I enjoyed my time with United Airlines and hope to use again."
Nov 2019,40,"Flight was okay, but it was nonstop. Check in was great and service was friendly.","As i said it was not a non stop; after arriving in Newark we had to change planes to arrive at our final destination - Paradise Island, Bahamas. We had to do the same thing on our return trip - flying from Nassau to Newark and then to Boston, but as I stated service was great and people were very friendly."
Nov 2019,30,Delayed flight,we were 4 hours delayed for mechanical problems in Newark. We overheard that the same thing happened the day before
Nov 2019,50,An 8 Hour Breeze!,"I have no complaints what so ever about my recent round trip flights to and from Barcelona, Spain and Washington Dulles Airport. The price was very competitive and it was 8 hours non-stop both ways. Further, even for my 6 foot plus travel partner, our economy seats were reasonably comfortable, in terms of seat width and legroom. We sat in the section to the right of the plane with only two seats in each row. The flight left in the early evening and arrived in Barcelona early enough to arrive at my hotel before breakfast service had ended.  The flight team provided friendly and excellent service, too. I highly recommend these flights and would use them again myself!"
Nov 2019,20,First class?,"We flew from New York to LAX return via Denver in first class.    You should down grade the so called first class to economy class. The reason is that the seats are worn, uncomfortable and really low standard. No footrests as well.  Beside that no pillows.  The reason given for the low standard is that it is domestic flights! Fact is that the International flights are really no better according to our reference.  Really no big difference except the price between first class and economy class.  Learn from most Asian International airlines as well the International middle Eastern Airlines."
Nov 2019,50,I always had a good relationship with United Airlines,"I have not complained abut united airlines I had been traveling with United for so many years. I remember when United start flying direct from New Zealand to Los Angeles  They had the mileage plus program, which we use it quite often, it was great.  This United flight from Guatemala to Newark is the only one that goes direct. I still have a taxi which takes one hour depends on the traffic, to New York City. But  It is better than having different stops, that makes the short trip much longer .  This trip takes only 4 hours and 50 minutes. In general United is quite good airline service is good the planes are in good conditions, most important the plane leaves on time most of the time I never had a big drama like I have with other airlines.  I will keep flying with United ."
Nov 2019,40,Awkward to start,"I was there early boarding took some time, hopefully they will get their own gate in Naples. I boarded found my seat. The seat next to me showed empty, a man was seat hoping hoping to be a seat by himself instead of his planned seat. A couple boarded late and he was in their seat and they thought I was in their seat. Demanded to see my ticket. I said no I was in my correct place. First guy got up an took the empty seat next to me.He was in their seat at that time. Not a biggie but I think we were a couple seats from the back and staff should of stepped in and made him go to his right seat. Also not airline but TSA searched my bags and I had three bottles of wine very carefully packed in zip lock bag, so if by chance one broke it would contain the spill. They ripped open the bag and just tossed the wine in the suitcase. Fortunately they did not break. I have luggage damaged and seen them tossed. I paid an extra $100 to bring that bag and I expected all who handle to do it with diligent care. Sure I'm not the only one to bring back a few bottles of wine. Just saying I respect the employees at the airport and expect the same treatment.  Otherwise I felt all was very good, and I enjoyed my visit immensely as well as the non-stop flight. Alleviated anxiety of passing thru airports. Thank you."
Nov 2019,50,Newark to Rome in Polaris,The Polaris Club in Newark was a pleasant experience. World class lounge. Great selection of spirits and food with a new sleek surroundings. Large private lavatories were clean and well appointed.  The flight was flawless and comfortable for a good sleep in the lie flat pods (love the gel pillow).
Nov 2019,40,Great customer service,"I flew from New delhi to atlanta.  Was promised internet, however, it never connected.  Was offered 200 dollars credit.  Great customer service"
Nov 2019,50,No complaints,"I was a little concerned after reading about Basic economy on here , but I cannot fault the airline having just flown today. Was concerned about my slightly larger than required back pack but no need to be , plus plenty of room to put it in overhead bins on both flights because I went via Chicago and no need to have it at my feet. I was given aisle seats on both flights and at emergency door on second flight and I have never had so much leg room. Staff at check in and on the flight were excellent. Small complimentary snack and drink were very welcome...left both airports on time and arrived early. For the price I paid I have no complaints...hope my journey back is just as good"
Nov 2019,10,Plane broke down,Our flight broke down to a mechanical issue. We never got to albuquerque for our vacation and only recieved a partial refund....let me just clarify. Our flight was not delayed we never got there. Period. And did not get a full refund
Nov 2019,50,"Early Departure, Early Arrival","Need more flights like this. Boarded early, departed early, arrived in Houston early. Great service fro two great flight attendants."
Nov 2019,40,Food,"United Airlines needs to do better with their inflight services. That likkle piece a biscuit will have you choking by the time they bring the likkle drop of something to drink. Everything was perfect going. Coming back, we had to pay for a movie and my ears are still recovering."
Nov 2019,40,Airlines on Time but the seats are small,"Although the Flight was on time the boarding process is archaic, if you are lucky to get your seat the overhead baggage compartments are packed tight with luggage. The economy seats are about 1/3 the size in the width of the seat which makes it very difficult for someone who is 6'2"" tall to sit comfortably. Bring back the regular seating PLEASE."
Nov 2019,50,No problems!,On time departure for both legs of our journey(Santo Domingo-Newark-Buffalo). THe business class upgrade was well worth the money. Very pleasant lunch and the flight attendants were very attentive. Clean comfortable planes.
Nov 2019,50,"Flight to Fairbanks, then from Seattle to Orlando.","Unfortunately, when the plane left the gate, there were numerous bolts of lightning and we had to wait till they were gone. Due to that five hours delay, we missed the second flight from Denver to Fairbanks. United took care of our overnight stay in Denver."
Nov 2019,20,Delay after delay after delay,First time I have flown United in years and I will think twice before doing it again. The in-house television was nice but the flight attendants were not as pleasant as other airlines. We experienced delay after delay causing us to miss our connection on the way there and almost miss our connection on our way back. Thankful I only took a carry on and didn't have to worry about checked bags ending up who knows where.  Thankful for the United app as there were too few representatives at the gates to assist the 100 + passengers that needed assistance re-booking.
Nov 2019,30,Weather delay caused a bad experience.,"Our flights to Tampa were on time and uneventful. My pet peeve is that airlines don't give you a whole can of soda when soda is requested, but most airlines seem to do the same thing.  Our return flight was delayed by bad weather, and our flight from Tampa to Houston was rerouted to Shreveport, LA. When we landed in Shreveport, we were told we'd just be refueling and taking off again. 3 hours later we took off again, without much information passed on to us during that time. We missed our connection, as did most of the passengers, and no accommodations were made for us. There was one more flight to COS that night, but it was full. We spent the night in Houston at our own expense.  One thing I found very helpful was United's app. I was able to use it to reschedule my flight, without having to wait in the hours-long line for customer service. Using the app, though, I was not able to locate my checked baggage, so I called United later that evening, and they were able to locate it and tag it to be on our connecting flight the next morning -- and it was! I was impressed."
Nov 2019,30,Basic Economy is last class,"You really need to know that you can’t have a carry on and you can’t choose your seat. You won’t know if you can sit with you husband or wife but I’ve noticed that toddlers are seated with parents, 😂    I will say, however, the distance to the seat in front of me was more than other airlines. So if you want to save money and don’t mind sitting in the middle seat, basic economy might be for you. Oh, on both flights, my seat wouldn’t go back."
Nov 2019,40,Best Flight,"Recently flew five times in seven weeks and this United flight was the best I have had not only in this time but over some years. They provided snacks, meals and drinks and were continually asking if they could do or get anything else. The crew were friendly and very obliging. If I could request this flight again I would."
Nov 2019,40,I see a glimmer of hope with United customer service.,"Actually I was flying to SFO from LAS also on United. Check in, gate agents and cabin service was good. I flew economy on this leg but switched to + on my flight to Portland. Both flights were good and everyone was courteous and professional. Sure glad I upgraded to Portland as there was lots of legroom and nobody in the middle seat. Captain was at the door thanking everyone as they deboarded. Nice touch!"
Nov 2019,20,"Uncomfortable, and late and poorly organized","Miserably small seats(frankly dangerous). Flight boarded late... as there was no crew. Shouldn’t someone be able to plan better? Plane couldn’t leave the gate, as some important piece of starting equipment had gone astray. Really? Plane couldn’t dock at Traverse City ( which only has 4 gates) because a plane was at its assigned gate (there were three others, and no other flights present). Once at the gate, there was additional delay getting the pod attached to the plane (missed the target twice) then, no broom to get the snow off the bridge so the attendant used her foot to clear it (really? No broom?). Then a 30 minute wait for luggage in an airport small enough to stroll around its perimeter 15 times in that amount of time..... Could have driven the distance faster."
Nov 2019,50,Why can’t United Domestic be like this international flight?,"I have always advised avoiding US airlines for international flights, but this Polaris Class flight had outstanding comfort, good food, and an excellent service crew inspired, perhaps, by their French head flight attendant. One leader can make a difference!"
Nov 2019,40,Best value for international travel with most destinations,"I travel around the world two or three times a year. Unfortunately, the airline that I use the most has poor coverage world wide. United seems to always have the best price. Food is decent. Economy seats reasonable. Best value for international travel."
Nov 2019,40,Good cabin crew.,"I upgraded to first on my flight back to Las Vegas. Plane departed on time. Service on board was good considering this flight was full. Due to a strong tailwind, we descended into Vegas very early. Unfortunately the tail wind was not good for landing and after a bumpy approach the captain decided on a go around. The second attempt finished in a very heavy landing. Full marks to the flight deck for getting us down safely in difficult conditions and still ahead of schedule."
Nov 2019,40,Flights were uneventful,"Basic flight from Memphis to Houston on one of the regional jets flown by a subsidiary. Checkin went smoothly, as did boarding and takeoff. Flight was uneventful as all flights should be. Professional crew did outstanding job. Return flight just as good. Smaller jets were a bit more cramped, but seat comfort and legroom were more than adequate."
Nov 2019,30,Unable to connect to free entertainment,In both ways I was not able to connect to the wifi. On the way back my flight was delayed ad by the time the plane was ready the water conditions on Aspen did not allow us to depart until next day and the airline did not help.
Nov 2019,10,Ms.,"What a horrible experience. Our flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue they knew about since the day before and as usual United personnel kept lying to us saying that the flight would leave on time. That didn't happen! When we arrived to Huston there was no effort to re book our flight or compensate us in any way. We lost our money for rental car, hotel and a tour that day. Ps. This is the second time this year something like this happened to me. Earlier this year United kept us inside a 90 degrees plane for 3 hours before they decided to also cancel that flight."
Nov 2019,20,Late Again,This flight departed a half hour late because of equipment maintenance issues on the incoming flight. I’ve been on several United flights in the last 10 days and I’ve heard this excuse more than once. Could be a significant problem with preventive maintenance.    The plan also wasn’t very clean.    Having said all that the flight attendant was fantastic. He was enthusiastic and cheerful and provide a great service.
Nov 2019,50,First Class to Denver,I had a regular economy ticket and then an upgrade offer came along for 179 dollars I went for it and glad to do so! This flight is operated by a 777-200 which means that unlike regular domestic 1st class you actually get an international business seat which lies flat. The service onboard was outstanding. Glass of Champagne upon boarding and then a lunch service once airborne. Drinks were available too free of charge. I also watched a movie. Highly recommend this flight!
Nov 2019,30,Wait for your luggage,"Flight was ok, left a bit late from MSY due airspace restrictions, landed on time in EWR. Then it took UA 40 Minutes to get the bags off the aircraft. Disappointing."
Nov 2019,40,Great crew and very efficient boarding gate staff,Our flight was a 1 stop though Houston but the incoming plane was late and so we wouldn't have made our connecting flight. The gate crew was very friendly and helpful putting us onto a flight into Chicago and onward to Toronto. When we boarded we realized we had been bumped into Economy Plus which helped with the extra hour of waiting we had. Boarding was quick and our bags fit in the overhead. The plane was clean and crew very nice. The extra legroom was great for me.
Nov 2019,40,Fine Service,"Nonstop. Left on time. Arrived early. Reasonably comfortable. Just what you would expect and hope for a ""local"" flight."
Nov 2019,50,Very good service,The flight attendants of flight UA28 are looking after the welfare of the passenger and gave us extra help: thank you so much!
Nov 2019,10,The worst business class (or any class) experience I ever had,"so that you understand depth of dissatisfaction: I was ticketed business class all the way to San Diego. Upon arrival to SFO I purchased Southwest ticket and flown economy just to avoid united.  I ordered kosher meal. I am not even going to say that it was disgusting. It was the same for both meals. IDENTICAL. I had to skip the 2nd one.  There was zero presence of the in-cabin crew in the business class cabin. I am an executive flying only business class internationally and mostly economy domestically. I do not drink alcohol so I do not need it there. All I am asking for is comfortable seats and MINIMAL presence of crew in the cabin so I could ask for water when I need it.  Cabin crew serving business class was extremely unhappy. Lady essentially threw my meal on my table without a word or without a smile. I can explain only by Kosher nature of the meal. Or if she is always like that I am sorry for United customers.  Dirty cups and trash was piling up on any side table. When I asked flight attendant to remove it she said she will do it later and never did it. I had to take trash out myself TWICE. Second time when I was throwing away trash into the plastic bag in the galley I was casually informed that I threw my trash into recycle instead of normal trash but sitting flight attendant  Doing the flight all flight attendants from business class were hanging out on the back of the plane. I could not ask for anything.  There were no mid flight snacks. Just a few juice cans in the business galley  I pressed the button for flight attendant to ask for coffee, it was responded to in 20 minutes (!!)  Overall, no service was existing. And I am not asking for much: just sparkling water and coffee.  Overall, this was the worst cabin service I ever experienced in my life not only in business class but I never experienced such terrible service even in economy. Imagine, that I preferred to buy other airline economy on my last leg rather than traveling on my actual itinerary in business united. Overall, I do not need either vouchers or miles. I am just done with United. I used to fly United a lot until 2014. I stopped for the same reason. I received message from CEO that the company changed this is why I decided to give it a try. I am all for giving second chances. However, if anything, United got only worse."
Nov 2019,40,United Airlines agent at DIA,"Could not get seats together with my husband when I booked online. They had us in the back of the plane behind each other in middle seats. Had to pay over $100 if we wanted to sit next to each other. We are both young seniors! Decided to ask the agent at the United desk at DIA.? What a polite person. She was wonderful. Was able to move us ti the same row. Someone in the middle but perhaps I can ask and the person would take the window seat. Well, that person may have changed seats because we got the row!    Doesn’t hurt to ask because you may receive what you would like. Be kind and nice. Airlines and hotel corporate nickel and dime you. Nice and kind people don’t!  I would recommend United because of the people I have had good experiences with."
Nov 2019,30,Birthday trip 2019,When flying to south Florida I would highly recommend flying into West Palm Beach International airport. The airport is clean and the entire staff is professional and courteous
Nov 2019,30,CozyCoach,"Boarded on time, checked carryons, staff courteous, helpful, humorous. Space tight, but to be expected given the lower price. Drink and small snack offered(I think most folks bring their own). Arrived on time, luggage transferred to next flight correctly, had just enough time to have lunch, and prepare for next flight."
Nov 2019,50,Big Flight delay first thing,"On our return from Leon (actually San Miguel de Allende) we received early morning text from the airline that our plane and flight crew arrived very late the night before and that we would have 2-3 hour delay so they could sleep. This created anxiety due to a now tight international connection in Houston. Our connection was the last flight to St. Louis. I needed to arrive home that night as I was playing piano for a funeral at 9 am the next morning. Anyway, once we got in the air the pilots accelerated our flight, arriving almost 30 minutes earlier than anticipated. In summary, we made the connection easily."
Nov 2019,40,Long but overall tolerable flight to Rome after 2 hour delay,The 12-hour flight was tough for sure making arrival and the next day brutal. Service was good plane fine just a weather delay.
Nov 2019,30,"Delays, Delays","Saturday morning, 7:30 am and the flight is delayed due to ATC in Houston. Delay was long enough the airline re-booked us on a later flight automatically and when the Wifve and I tried to check in, I was on the re-booked flight but she was on one two hours later. They could not get her on my fight so we were both delayed for 2 more hours. Gate Agebts were great, out of their control though."
Nov 2019,50,Very Nice,United made my flight from LAX to Cleveland very smooth. From boarding to arriving was really a pleasant experience which is not always the case.  Great surprise.
Nov 2019,10,Stuck in Newark,"I flew into Newark during a huge wind storm, I’ve never seen so many people grab barf bags. Then they delayed my flight six times. At 1:30am, they cancelled the flight. Nobody was at the airport to help us except baggage claim. They promised to put us up in a hotel, then couldn’t found them to be all booked, so they said they would cover hotel cost up to $200. I ended up renting a car to Portland. They never reimbursed my hotel or my rental car. Horrible flight, horrible service, horrible experience. I will NEVER fly United again, or any of their affiliates."
Nov 2019,10,United Domestic First Class is an Embarrassment!,"I flew from Dulles to Seattle in what was purportedly First Class. On arrival at the airport, I had to print my own boarding pass and check my own bag. When I got through Security and walked a long way to the Lounge, I was told that Domestic First Class is not entitled to use the Business Lounge unless I paid about $50 or unless I was continuing on to an international connecting flight. I opted to skip that (having seem the crowded and crummy lounge when I have been connecting internationally). When I got on the plane, the seat was essentially a Lazy-Boy recliner, covered in a fabric that did not breathe, so my pants were soon moist and I was uncomfortably warm. The food was essentially an over-cooked TV dinner, and the leg room between my row and my neighbor ahead was not much more than what they had back in Economy. It was completely NOT worth the money to fly in the front."
Nov 2019,40,Good seat,"My economy seat was comfortable and had good legroom. The inflight crew were attentive. Being a gold member of Star Alliance, I had advanced boarding, which allowed me to store my luggage before the crowds boarded."
Nov 2019,20,Thank God I Didn't Pay Full Price!,"I will preface this by stating that I flew on a mileage award ticket and if I had paid thousands of dollars for this trip I would have been even more disappointed. My experience was not horrible by any means but it really didn't live up to the Polaris hype nor even to what I would consider reasonable expectations of an international premium cabin.    First, the good:  1. The United Polaris lounge at LAX was simply amazing. The food was terrific, the service was friendly, and the decor was elegant and refined in a modern, non-stuffy way. The fact that one could take a shower in between connecting flights was wonderful and left me feeling refreshed before boarding my connection. This is truly a huge step up from the standard United Club lounges.    2. The check-in at Narita Airport was fast and friendly. The agent was extremely friendly in a country that is already known for politeness.    3. The amenities kit was pretty nice. Not as nice as the older Tumi kits on Delta One [the ones that felt and handled like an actual piece of purchased Tumi luggage accessories] but still nice. The Sunday Riley products were decent and the case itself felt like a nice quality item that could certainly be reused.    Now for the disappointments.  1. The food. This is always subjective and airplane food is not meant to be haute cuisine. However, one sees many amazing videos/pictures online these days of the wonderful and inventive things airlines are providing in their premium cabins; said pictures rarely include cafeteria-style casserole dishes that are pre-plated. In addition to not feeling luxurious in the least, they actually ran out of the Japanese entrees on our flight which meant several people [myself, my husband, and at least 3 people seated around us included] had to get their second choice. The western option of chicken that I got was actually pretty tasty, so they get props for taste even if presentation was mediocre, but I find it unacceptable for an airline to run our of any options in a premium cabin. How do you tell a passenger that paid $5,000+ for a ticket that they can't have their first choice of entree? On an awards ticket I can't complain too much but it did not entice me to ever pay full fare to travel in Polaris in the future. At this level of service, the airline should be prepared for any possibility and have enough of everything in case a passenger wants it; skimping on a few $10 meals for passengers that paid thousands is bad form. The ice cream sundae prepared seatside was very good but the fact that we were only offered a choice of one dessert felt, again, a little cheap. Last time I flew Delta ONE, the stewardess provided a small sampling of all the dessert options when I said I couldn't decide. United did not go above and beyond at all. I won't harp on their choice to serve a no-name ""sparkling wine"" in lieu of proper champagne but a Moet or Veuve Clicquot shouldn't be too much to ask in business class; other airlines serve even pricier brands.    2. The seats. The 2 x 2 x 2 config is outdated and and a little crowded. United really advertised the heck out of Polaris but is taking years to update the planes with the new seats. We flew a 787 so were luckier than some people [other planes have 2 x 4 x 2 in business class!!]. There was a nice amount of leg room but the seat was a bit narrower than I was expecting and the storage spaces were sort of awkward. There was very little storage on either side of the seat which basically just left the cubby above the foot rest and a very small shelf to the right of the headrest.    3. The onboard service was polite but lacked any sort of warmth. No pajamas were offered though knowing UA, they probably weren't available anyway. No turndown of the seats into a bed or even the offering of a mattress topper that was advertised in the menu card at every seat. No snack tray mid-flight was brought around; we got our two meals [dinner and breakfast] and that was it. I'm sure snacks and other services were probably available if we asked but, in past experiences on other airlines, the first and business class crew is usually extra-friendly to the point of doting rather than just being bare-bones polite. There was no ""above and beyond"" from the crew on this trip."
Nov 2019,10,They are all Similar,"You wish that there would be a winner among the  US Major Airlines... Sadly, it appears that not one of the  major carriers can claim victory.    United has better attendants on the ground. More polite,  more pleasant. happy to assist. Once on the plane  the Crew is already frazzled before take off. One  member complained to passengers that they are behind  with passing out drinks so please be quick with drink  requests. Why would that be the passengers concern-  why was the Crew Member behind in her service?  Next, the Crew Member took our lunch order.  There were two choices & we selected. Once in flight  lunch was served & low & behold my selection wasn’t  available. The Crew Member offered me a selection she  was out of- she didn’t keep track of how many choices she  had on hand. The food was on par with all the other  Carriers- dismal. Why the Airlines can’t understand that  “quality” trumps everything else- it’s perplexing.    The Aircraft, like it’s competitors, was not shining with  cleanliness. Germs seem to Hibernate & multiple, waiting to greet each & every one of us.    Unfortunately United is no better in any onboard category.  Air travel domestically is deplorable. Every CEO of these  Companies should be held accountable & fired for  unsatisfactory job performance. Forget delays, lack  of crews & pilots, poor condition of aircrafts, cancellations  without probable cause. They can’t even have a Fleet  that is clean, has simple quality food & employs  crews that are true service providers. Truly is it that  arduous to have an Airline that functions better then  a “D”......."
Nov 2019,50,Great service from Sabrina,"From our flight to Houston from Las Vegas our service was a bit slow due to turbulence and (the fact that we were in the last row, lol). Sabrina, our flight attendant was Fantastic and really stepped up with her customer service as we were parched by the time she reached us. She was extremely personable and attentive. I would enjoy having her on any flight with United!"
Nov 2019,40,"bad news, good news","I have had good experience in the past with United, but this flight was more problematical. I have their app, so I received a text message at about 2 in the morning that my flight was delayed, so they put me on an alternate. The alternate itinerary would not work at all for me, so I used the app to find my own alternate. It gave me several options, so I was able to rebook relatively easily, although I had to leave nearly three hours earlier than originally scheduled, with a much longer layover than originally planned. Thereafter the flights were fine. One thing I don't like about United: they have a basic economy and a premium economy class. On the basic you cannot take a regulation carry-on, only an under-seat item. The premium economy allows you to take a carry-on, but it basically costs about as much extra as checking a bag. I think that is just wrong."
Nov 2019,50,"Flying First Class from Chicago,IL.,to Las Vega,Nevada","My Son,daughter,husband and myself were taking a ""family Vacation"",to Las Vegas.  We had to take a flight from Moline,IL.,to Chicago,IL.,which was very comfortable in spite, of it not being ""first Class"". The staff was friendly and made us feel very comfortable,and the flight was less than an hour,from boarding,taxing and landing in Chicago.    Our boarding,was very smooth and the staff were very friendly. We knew it would take several hours,so the 4 of us ""flew First Class"". The staff was so nice and friendly. Since we left quite early, on a Monday morning,we were given brunch. The choices were between a hot or cold meal. My husband and I choose the cold plate.  When they brought our food,it was UN-believable! There was ham,pc's of cheese,fresh slice of orange,almonds,a med bowl of asst fruits and yogurt,sweet roll/muffin and several beverages to drink.  The best part was......each of the 18 seats{had a small TV,to watch,which we were given ear phones,to listen and several channels to watch}.  The flight was so smooth,we barely knew when we touched down.  The flight back was just as comfortable{we didn't have TV's,but that was ok},as we were tired from sight seeing in Vegas,LOL. All 4 of us,slept after brunch and touched down in Chicago,rested,LOL."
Nov 2019,10,Miserable from start to finish,"This flight was miserable from start to finish both ways. My wife was almost run over by a luggage train. United expects you to use your own personal device for entertainment on a a 8 hour flight. Then the Wifi did not work,so there was none. I feed raccoons in my back yard. I would not give them the food we paid for. On the way back, Denver was getting iced in. Due to pilot mistake we had to return for gas and arrived 6 hours late with no crew in Little Rock to receive us. I contacted United and they sent me credit for my next flight which I told them where they could store them."
Nov 2019,40,First Leg to SFO,"There was weather in the area and my connecting flight was delayed. When a colleague asked upon arriving, the gate attendant immediately transferred his reservation to an earlier flight without charge. When I tried to do the same thing I was told the delay was less than an hour so I could not change the reservation without charge.    One sad note, some folks had very close connections to later flights. The attendants pointed them out to the other passengers and made it clear to let them pass so they might leave first. Of course when we land and the fasten seat belt sign goes off everyone jumps into the aisle as if the plane is on freakin' fire, stranding those folks who needed to make their connections."
Nov 2019,10,Don’t do it!,By far the worst airline experience in the business... the last 3 trips from the same airport have been delayed for hours so it should come as no surprise to me that it happened again this time. I will never fly United again and will ensure my family and friends hear about my consistent experience. I will be cancelling my United credit card and will never fly United again!
Nov 2019,50,great trip,"great trip and awesome attention, plane was very comfortable, staff was the best and everything seemed clean when we boarded the plane"
Nov 2019,30,still not my favorite airline... not even in the top 5!,"long, long delays in takeoff causing a 'near miss' in the connection area. Stewards (or whatever they like to be called now) did not seem happy to be working that day. Just a bad vibe throughout the entire cabin. When we arrived in Houston, the ONLY reason I got my connecting flight (also United) was that it was delayed coming in. Because reclaiming the luggage in Houston (because of customs) was a NIGHTMARE... Waited over 20 minutes at the luggage area to get my bag. Delay seems to be a trend with United."
Nov 2019,40,best trip ever with united,as I was checking in with the desk the young man checking me in was very polite and even before I could ask he saw that I was tall and move me to a seat that had plenty of leg room thank you for your great people
Nov 2019,50,Nice Flight,"First time to fly United and I actually liked it better than Delta or American airlines...flight attendants were helpful and friendly, the food was actually good."
Nov 2019,30,Too long a delay,Flight delayed by weahter but notification came less than two hours before departure.  Food on flight was poor
Nov 2019,10,United Airlines - the world's worst airline,"3 Mar UA flight LH7643 dep 09.05, arr 12.00 EDI to EWR  Delta flight DL2528 dep 17.59, arr 20.25 LGA to MSY  The departure time was late and after spending 2 hours on board and been told 5 different reasons why we would be departing shortly, we were finally told the flight had been cancelled (door wouldn't close properly and they didn't have any inspectors in Scotland). We had to disembark, collect our luggage and join a long queue to hear from one of only 2 members of staff what they were going to do. Eventually, I was told that I would stay free of charge at the Hilton Doubletree Hotel and fly out the next day on flight 2824. I explained that he would also have to get me on a flight from Newark to New Orleans. I was told that because my connecting flight had been with Delta, there was nothing he could do. After a fierce argument for 20 minutes I finally got to speak by phone to his superior (Stephanie, I think) who told me that if Delta could not arrange a suitable flight for free, then I would have to find a flight and United would re-imburse me for the cost. Delta could not help me. UA refused to pay the cost of replacement flight to New Orleans. I booked a UA flight to New Orleans from Newark, dep 15.00.  Cancellation of flght  Loss of 1 night's accomodation (non-refundable) in Jung Hotel, New Orleans  Cost of replacement flight from New York to New Orleans  4 Mar At Edinburgh airport I told UA check-in staff that I had a connecting flight to New Orleans and asked for my luggage to be booked straight through. They told me that I had no connecting flight to New Orleans. After 20 minutes of 4 of them playing about on their computer they finally agreed that I had a connecting flight, which I would have plenty of time to catch as I simply had to collect my case and drop it off at the appropriate UA desk without going through Passport Control or Security. This turned out to be completely untrue.  The flight arrived in Newark over 3 hours late and I missed my connection (there was a fox on the runway which didn't affect any incoming flights!) The flight (UA) which I eventually got arrived over 4 hours late in New Orleans.  Delay 1  Delay 2  8 Mar The flight from Newark to Edinburgh arrived over an hour late (they were having a problem with their caterers) resulting in my missing my reserved bus connection to Glasgow..  UA offered me a voucher for $250.00 as compensation. After weeks of wrangling they eventually paid me the 600 euros they were legally obliged to pay.  I had booked my flight with UA through BookAir and threatened to sue them as the transaction was subject to Scottish law. In August they refunded the cost of both my outward and inward flight from Edinburgh to Newark. So after months of wrangling and frustration my flights to and from Newark with the world's worst airline cost me nothing plus I got 600 euros compensation."
Nov 2019,50,UA1205,"Located in the Pacific, it’s a journey to get to the mainland but it’s the adventure we seek!  Flight from Kona was set for 1:48pm but we received an email schedule changed to 2pm.  It was a great flight for one who sleeps 3 hours from when the plane is still on the ground...hahaha!  Flight was not full at all so we were able to move a seat down in our row. No TVs but if you download the current free United app you can watch from your device.  Leg room on this plane was great. I didn’t find it squishy and I’m a tiny person! Great crew, very friendly.  A meal can be purchased: a sandwich or cheese platter.  Landed in LA a little before 9pm. Flight was great. I highly recommend UA1205 departing KOA to LAX. Thank you United!"
Nov 2019,30,ORIORDANT,"I was not impressed by one of the attendants in this flight. She was bad mannered and rude. I have complained to United, they said they were sorry. The flight departed on time on 23/10/19 and arrived ahead of time. The ""food"" was terrible, if offered to my cat I am sure he would decline."
Nov 2019,40,A good flight,We left on time & got to our destination a little early. Service was great. I would fly with United again.
Nov 2019,40,Late flight was bumpy.,"The flight departed Houston two hours late due to a mechanical delay in Philadelphia. We enjoyed the club lounge during the delay. The flight, which we used reward points for, was quite bumpy due to moving air masses but otherwise uneventful."
Nov 2019,50,Best flight ever!,"The United flight crew and staff at the Kalispell airport were absolutely phenomenal. Weather prompted the airline to offer flight changes to another day free of charge (worked out well for our plans), however, the next day flight's takeoff was delayed per weather at our destination.The captain kept us updated as to what was going on during the 4 hour delay, she came out to talk with us personally and even spent time talking about her career as a pilot to a group of FFA high schoolers who were travelling to a national competition. The storm clouds over Denver left zero visibility, and yet the pilot landed the plane like she was driving a car - I never even knew the wheels hit the runway!!! Absolutely the best flight I have ever taken, even with the delay!!! Thank you United!"
Nov 2019,40,Marathon to Hong Kong,"Holy cow! This was a LONG flight - 16 hours. It's kinda manageable if you like to watch a lot of movies or binge watch your favorite TV series. Make sure you either get a window seat so you can crash again the wall (and NOT your strange neighbor), or, if you require the facilities fairly regularly, an aisle seat. The middle seats are a bummer (unless you're with your sweetie and he/she doesn't mind drool on their shoulder. Hey - isn't that one of the definitions of love). If you're flying economy as I did, try to book a seat between row 30 and 43 (44?) as you'll have your choice of lavatories. No one likes to wait in lines."
Nov 2019,30,Business Class was just “OK”.,"The food was excellent as was the service during the meal. After the meal had been served however, there was basically no service at all......just a “self-help/grab/go” cart at the front of the cabin, other than a meal just before landing. The toilet was cleaned a couple of times during the flight which was appreciated. The plane was an older model and needed some updating and I didn’t think the seat was comfortable but it had to be much better than coach. With that said, the flight was safe and we arrived on time in Houston so, applause for that!"
Nov 2019,40,Great flight,"The Dreamliner was so comfortable. The crew were friendly & welcoming. The food was good for a long flight, the seats were very comfortable"
Nov 2019,50,US Trip,Excellent flight. Newark a good airport to transit through if a little long to get to in rush hour  Comfy seats  Great choice of films  Decent food  Friendly service
Nov 2019,10,Never again,"Staff all angry. Not a smile anywhere except the pilot. Rude comments by flight attendants to passengers. Arbitrarily forced passengers to check even very small carry on bags with no explanation and when passengers got on plane, overhead compartments half empty. It almost seemed like an SNL skit. Have flown United for years, it has gotten progressively worse. Last nights flight was the final straw. Never again"
Nov 2019,50,no issues - all went well,"everything went very smooth. Boarded on time, on-time departure. Good service, friendly and helpful crew. Entertainment options were good, plenty to last the 15 hour flight"
Nov 2019,50,Smooth Effortless Most Satisfying Flight!!,"My daughter and I had a last-minute trip to Tel Aviv to scout out wedding venues. United Airlines and all the staff on that flight took fabulous care of us! The business class seats made a perfect bed, the movies varied and interesting, the food very satisfying and the overall flight great experience! We will definitely use United airlines on our next flight! We had heard nightmare stories about the other airlines that flew direct so we couldn’t have been happier! Thank you United!"
Nov 2019,10,Cancelled flight and price gouged for alternative one.,"I had booked a round trip flight on United Airlines from Staunton, VA to Chicago, IL. The return trip was cancelled and United said they could book an alternative flight two days out. All seats for other United flights flying to other parts of VA that night were supposedly full. When I looked online I did find a first class seat to Richmond that same night but for $996.00. I thought I wouldn't have a problem getting reimbursed since I stayed with United. To my dismay, United only reimbursed me $98.00 and gave me a $200 voucher to use within the year. I appreciated their efforts but I was still $698 short! United's price gouging for a cancelled flight shows a lack of concern for customer service and their willingness to take financial advantage of their customers desire to return home in a timely fashion. I am very disappointed in United and will look for other airlines to meet my flying needs."
Nov 2019,40,Easy trip to Boston and back for two weeks of fall color,"Economy plus was adequate for this 2 hour plus flight. Food? a cookie! We tend to bring our own sandwiches if we want to eat on a plane and did so on the outbound flight. Can't really complain about anything as this is air travel today. One note is that we hit the Cyclone Bomb (northeasterner) the day we left- it had started the day before. Our flight got out on time and we arrived early. Friends, who traveled with us, flew SW to Chicago Midway. They left fours late."
Nov 2019,30,Lucky to get home,"We were delayed overnight in Boston because we missed our evening flight the night before. Our connecting flight arrived ten minutes after our next flight left. So, we got a hotel and went to bed for an early flight the next day.    Unfortunately, weather was bad in Denver so we had to wait an hour and a half at the gate after we boarded. Then, after we pushed back we had another 2 1/2 hour wait on the tarmac. I must say the crew was excellent but sitting eight hours for a five hour flight is tough. In the end we were lucky because all of the flights after ours were cancelled."
Nov 2019,40,Feels like home,"We fly to Europe every year and the service just keeps better.  There's nothing like stepping onto the aircraft and getting a warm welcome, especially on flights back to the States.  I like the diversity of the crew.  The food has improved but the coffee is simply awful. Was it really Illy?  Movie choices are current.  Washroom needs more frequent cleaning"
Nov 2019,30,Quick flight back home,"United needs some personnel in Newark for customer assistance. Boarding was helter skelter.  Because of problems with the aircraft in front of us, we sat on the taxiway for a while, but the pilot made up most of the time, so a we arrived about 10 minutes late."
Nov 2019,40,excellent app and info about your flight,"the most relevant advantage is the information about the flight up to a minute before boarding. afterwards, the flight is as usual"
Nov 2019,50,Scary turbulence for last 1/2 hour,"Must have been Sully Sultenmeier in the cock pit, as he held the plane level in outrageous turbulence! The winds had grounded other planes from take off from Newark, NJ while ours landed on the short tarmac. Many on the flight near me were crossing themselves, crying out to their Maker, or hanging on for dear life. As a born again Christian, I knew my life was in the Lord's hand. Nevertheless, I did pray for the pilots. I also thanked him for the ""Best Ride Ever""."
Nov 2019,30,United Airlines London to Sydney,Punctuality fine. Staff fine. Food dire (I'm far from fussy). In flight films mainly old. Having to collect luggage at transit airport LAX a pain even if it was taken straight off you again! Come on folks pay LAX luggage handling company to do this you cheap stakes.
Nov 2019,50,Smooth sailing,"Great flight, excellent service. Everything was on time. Not always like this, but happy to say that my experience on this flight with United was great."
Nov 2019,40,Fast to the beach,"We have used this particular flight 3 times in the last 18 months. Leaves Houston at noon and we were on the beach with a drink in our hands at 3 p.m.! Always on time or early, flight crew outstanding and fun!"
Nov 2019,50,GREAT AIRLINE,"Have traveled on United many times and have always had a good experience. Always on time unless weather interferes. I require a wheelchair in large airports and they are always waiting on me. Their Customer Service is kind, considerate and always handle any small problems I have with ticketing."
Nov 2019,40,Quick flight.,"Short flight with United on the Las Vegas to San Francisco route. Only had hand luggage so used the automatic check in desk. Flight departed the gate on time, however a technical fault meant we had to wait on the taxiway before the fault was fixed. Flight was ok with decent enough on board service. Seats were comfortable. Arrival in San Francisco was delayed by 15 minutes, due to ground traffic. First time on an internal flight with United. Found the experience ok."
Nov 2019,30,Flying across country,"Typical airline. They are starting to act the bargain airlines. Everything gets charged.... a ""premium"" seat that isn't ""Premium"". It's just not in the last few rows. But, still in the back of the plane, but they still charge more for those seats. Charging for check in, charging for everything! The service is standard, the trip was standard. The arrival was on time, which is VERY important. Overall, very standard."
Nov 2019,40,Solid service,"We had an unexpectedly great flight on a 777. Premium economy on these planes is like business class 25 years ago. We had solid entertainment, decent food, and comfortable seats."
Nov 2019,40,Customer Service,"Our flight from Paris to Washington DC was cancelled and had to be rescheduled for the next day, CDG airport is a nightmare and we had to do a very long line in United to see how we were going to fly to our destination, they weren't expecting that many people but the service was excellent, not all the people were happy with the cancellation and some of them were really mad, United handled the problem very well."
Nov 2019,50,Very Helpful,"I had traveled to Nashville and then to Charlotte, to assist my aunt Boise, I mentioned that I would need wheelchair assistance for my aunt, United Airlines was so accommodating and was right there and wheel her to the gate and made sure she was comfortable."
Nov 2019,10,"United, you should be ashamed!","My wife and I have flown often on United, and before that Continental, for some thirty years. I fly often for business and I’ve accumulated over 500,000 miles in United’s frequent flyer program. But something happened last week that has made us vow never to fly United again.    My wife a ticket to London that included a seat in their new Premium Plus class on the outbound flight. Needless to say, she paid extra for this seat to enjoy the extra leg room and other amenities. However, two days before the fight, she received an email saying that the aircraft had been changed and she was now in a regular Economy class seat. No explanation as to why she was moved to a different class of service — and no offer to adjust the airfare.    We checked the seat map for the aircraft and saw that there were many empty and available Premium Plus seats. So my wife spent about an hour on the phone with a United representative who eventually understood what the issue was and moved her back to one of those empty seats in the class of service she had purchased.    Guess what — the next evening she received yet another email saying that her seat had been changed. Guess what — to regular Economy class again. We checked the seat map — and there were still empty seats in Premium Plus. So she called again and the agent said she could not be given a different seat because now it was less than 24 hours before the flight. So their rules allow them to move you from your assigned seat without warning but prevent you from correcting their error. (This time they did offer to give her not a refund but a credit for a small amount, a credit that one can only spend on more terrible United service.) She called again and spoke to a different agent who agreed to place her in the seat she had been in the previous day — and then didn’t.    Finally, I called the frequent flyer program number and complained on her behalf. This time they did agree to assign her a seat in the class of service she had paid for, but they couldn’t guarantee the assignment would not be changed again. Honestly, who would knowingly pay for a ticket with a guaranteed seat but accept that there really is no guarantee — turn up at the airport and try your luck. Not a great plan, since by this time the Economy section was completely full.    Why was this happening? The key to understanding this is that United now was offering to sell the empty Premium Plus seats for several hundred dollars more than my wife had paid weeks before. In other words, this was just a classic bait-and-switch operation. Yes, we’ve sold you a seat in this higher class of service, but if we can resell it at a higher price, we’ll bump you.    United has been slipping for years — the planes are often dirty, there appear to be more delays than in the past, the quality of in-flight food has gone from poor to appalling — but this fiasco takes the prize.    United, we’re done, and our advice to all other travelers is -- fly any other airline if you can."
Nov 2019,20,Plane almost crashed,"Emergency landing an hour into the flight from burning wires. We were prepped for safety and evacuation procedures. We were taught the brace position and had to use it for landing. People were screaming and crying “I don’t wNt to die!” We had the best pilot and bravest FA, but absolutely terrifying flight!! UA1130 on November 2, 2019"
Nov 2019,50,Enjoyable Flight,"Courteous flight attendants with a very informative pilot made the flight enjoyable and made the travel time ""fly"" by."
Nov 2019,10,No customer protection,"Had a flight from tampa florida to albuquerque new Mexico balloon festival. Uniteds plane had a mechanical issue that delayed our flight. They rebooked us on a different plane since we were going to miss our layover instead of rebooking our layover. The second flight had a mechanical issue and then the 3rd hit weather. They had no flight to get us to the rest of the way after, mind you, we sat on the tarmac for 2 and 1/2 hours. With the only option to fly home and completely miss our vacation. (Planned 4 months ahead of time) after all this and fighting several tours, hotels, and car rentals to get our money refunded. United gave us a partial refund. We never reached our location and we actually never even made it to a layover destination. They are thieves that do not respect their customers or honor their flights. Better hope nothing goes wrong with your plan or your losing your money and your trip"
Nov 2019,30,It got us there on time.,"Most important: It got us there on time.    Anything other than getting you there on time is secondary. So, three points for that. Like all flights, it was crowded and noisy. There were babies crying, both going and coming, which went on for hours, and while I can't fault the airline for that, it makes the flight pretty miserable. Other services, like the drinks and the no-food, were customary. All in all, pretty standard, not bad, and got us there on time."
Nov 2019,40,United,Service was ok - they did help me with seat assignment - and moved me up in the boarding line - both were helpful
Nov 2019,40,Getting there,"Flawless trip, but substandard food while watching the first class platters carried past to the galley. Gate person in Milan was helpful and he is the reason we would use United again."
Nov 2019,50,Flights from PIT to PEK,"The aircrafts were good and seats were comfortable. The flight attendants were very nice too. Since I don't have long legs, the leg space was no problem with me. Even the aircrafts used for the domestic flights were adequate. The restrooms were very tight and it could be a little challenge for big people. Most of the flight attendants were cheerful and served with a good attitude, except for one who had a long face."
Nov 2019,40,The best airline meal ever !,We were offloaded by another airline on to the 12 hour flight overnight with United  My wife and I had a centre row to ourselves and made good use of it.  This was thanks to a helpful desk clerk named Joanne Joy as we were preparing to go to the gate !  The meal that came at about 1.00am was superb. Hot and filling. Well done United.  The service was great and we had no complaints.
Nov 2019,50,United Express,"What a pleasure flying United Express into Plattsburgh New York. On time, pleasant staff smooth flight. I will definitely repeat this visit. Airfare reasonable and a direct flight."
Nov 2019,10,Terrible,Our connecting flight was slightly delayed. United Airlines refused to hold our next airplane a few minutes to let us get to the gate. Made us wait 9 hours in the airport for the next flight. Never will fly United again.
Nov 2019,50,Great flight both ways,The flights to Dallas from Chicago and back were both great flights. My son and I had basic economy and were seated together both ways truly appreciated that. The takeoff and landings were smooth on both flights also.
Nov 2019,30,Flight rescheduled,"Things went downwards right at the checkin counter. Staff were asking for volunteers to board Cathay Pacific and when asked about the reason were told that the flight is going to be an hour delayed. Spent 3 hours inside the flight that ended up getting cancelled. Initially the reason given was ""a new flight route needs to be drafted as Pak airspace was closed. awaiting further permissions."" Later on we heard that the crew scheduling was the actual reason since the crew were not adequately rested. Pilot did announce the flight got cancelled but no further instructions as to when the next flight will be. This gave rise to a chaotic environment at the airport. We were asked to collect our luggages and re-check-in on the next flight. Having said this, United were professional in handling the accommodation in a 4-star and getting the next flight arranged the very next day. This was my first time with United and so I would give them 'Average' as I feel they could have shared the information right at the start and I could arrange for other options. Good staff, good food and drinks along with an average infotainment system. Seats were ok and leg room was average."
Nov 2019,50,Professional service,"I have traveled the world extensively on many airlines, but I always find myself going back to United Airlines due to it’s amazing rewards program, updated aircraft’s and the professional flight attendants. They always have a way of putting a smile on my face and getting me where I need to in a safe and on time manner."
Nov 2019,30,Nice,It was ok I did like it not a lot though I liked the seats I liked the snack and the TVs it was a good flight it was my first time
Nov 2019,50,Overall Great Flights,Check-in staff was excellent - very friendly and caring - we needed a change in ticketing to go from San Diego through LA and then to Vancouver BC - handled well - excellants seats.
Nov 2019,50,Great Customer service,"The flight attendant from Rapid city to Denver was very excited that we took that flight she was very helpful with drinks and snacks, she even had a personality"
Nov 2019,40,Honolulu Club was really dirty,"Flight was okay but really the seats were kind of dirty, food and stuff between the seats. The worst was the Club at the airport. When we arrived, there so many tables with dirty plates and glasses. I couldn't believe it. I thought they were just short handed but when I looked at the side of my chair, it was filthy. Not I don't mean someone had just spilled, it was crusty and dried out crud. Worst ever. I understand that the club may be moving or remolded, and could really use a refresh, but no excuse to be unclean. Flight attendants were nice."
Nov 2019,30,all went well,Plane was packed. Our first stop was Mexico City for a 4 hour wait. Huge airport but  a very interesting place with people from all over the world. Time passed by quickly.  I found my new gate & boarded a smaller (5 seats across in each row) jet for my trip to the beach where the Manzanillo airport is situated with runways Parallel to the  Pacific ocean. I shared a cab with a fellow passenger for 300 pesos( $15 US) each.  It was a half hour cab ride to Melaque. I was at the Hotel Santa Maria & on the beach by 4:00PM.
Nov 2019,50,Best Flight Attendant,We had the most friendly and helpful flight attendant on this flight. Kudos to United. We stopped in two clubs at ORD and both were nice but food selection could have been better.
Nov 2019,50,Short but fine,Very short flight from MKE to ORD. Just really an inconvenience but the flight to Hawaii was actually less expensive than flying to only to ORD.
Nov 2019,50,Always outstanding,"As an almost 3 million miler with a United....started as Continental and stayed the loyalty for which I am very thankful. United employees really stepped up their appreciation for loyalty. I am blessed to travel, almost always, in Polaris class. You don’t want to land even after 15 hours."
Nov 2019,40,Good flight; bad connection times,"Flight from Burbank to Denver was fine. Gate at Denver to Moline was a LONG ways away! And connection time was too long (about 2 hours). Coming home: same thing. Nothing wrong with flight itself, but connection time from Denver to Burbank was LONG (about 3 hours)."
Nov 2019,40,to tight,"to tight to be all the way dawn to florida, also have to pay for luggage, may to expensive , will look for other options"
Nov 2019,20,United Airlines Travel,I travelled by United Airlines from Houston to Delhi in October 18.  The advantage of travelling through United is it's a direct flight from New York to Delhi starting at night around 10.30pm local time and reaches Delhi at 9.30 pm next day so you can take a uninterrupted sleep once take off. It's a 14 hours direct flight approximately.  Recently they have added Hindi speaking Crew members and announcements are also in Hindi to make you comfortable in case the American English accent is not very comfortable to you or any of your family member.  But United is much more expensive than many other airlines.  But overall it's it's okay.
Nov 2019,10,The most pathetic flight experience in years,"I paid up for the premium economy to get more legroom and the legroom was adequate.  That was pretty much the only positive thing on the whole flight (oh and hey, it was a new airplane...)  - The seats are so narrow that unless you are a dwarf out of United's design department, it is IMPOSSIBLE to seat two normal sized adults side by side without the one constantly bumping into the other. It felt more like sitting on the other person's lap. 20""-24"" seat width at best  - Comfortable? HELL NO! It felt like the steel the chairs were made of was simply covered with some vinyl to make it look different. Hard as a rock, almost ZERO recline and with not even the seat width being sufficient, you will be cramped into the seat in the most uncomfortable position anyhow, so no wonder you get out with pain in the back.  - ""Refreshments"" - Seriously F U > < Y O U United. A plastic cup of FRIGGING TAP WATER???? THEY REALLY DARE TO SERVE YOUR CUSTOMERS WHO PAY $600 FOR A 1 HR FLIGHT FRIGGING WATER THAT IS NOT EVEN BOTTLED??? THEY MUST BE OUT OF THEIR FU<>ING MID.    I highly recommend booking with ANY other airline and you will have a better flight experience than what they do to you. Even Allegiant's $30 flights are more comfortable than the crap United offers."
Nov 2019,30,No issues - easy flight,"We were off early to Atlanta Hartsfield from O'Hare and when we arrived at O'Hare, everything went smoothly from the initial check-in to boarding. The flight left five minutes early and we arrived in Atlanta approximately 17 minutes early. The staff at O'Hare was good and the flight was completely uneventful and smooth. We were on a Boeing 737-900 (twin-jet) (B739),"
Nov 2019,30,A really good flight,"As it worked out, we were supposed to fly out from Atlanta about 1800 hrs., but when we arrived at Hartsfield, we were advised that there was another flight leaving earlier that had been delayed and because it had been delayed, we could probably make that flight. We did and we were home a couple of hours before we would have been We were on an ExpressJet, an EMBRAER ERJ-170-200 (long wing) (twin-jet) (E75L). The flight was comfortable throughout. So, though the actual flight was an hour & four minutes late in leaving Hartsfield, we arrived at O'Hare 47 minutes later than the scheduled time. But we were at least three hours ahead of our original time. All, in all, a good day traveling."
Nov 2019,10,Left Stranded,"Flight pulled away from the gate and parked on the tarmac due to air traffic control instructions from Houston, 15 miinutes later it developed into a mechancal issue. Flight crew assured us we would be re-routed, and that turned out to be a lie. Had we taken the flight from MFE to IAH we would have been stranded without acccommodations. Departures offered were to destinations to Las Vegas, Chicago, et. a. with an arrival TWO DAYS LATER. No compensation or other arrangements offered by United. I've flown over 525,000 lifetime miles with United and no regard for a dedicated customer."
Nov 2019,50,Great flight,Good flight. We even arrived half an hour early. Luggage arrived promptly. Entertainment was good. We spent the time watching 4 current movies.
Nov 2019,50,Nice Flight,I like United. This flight I changed planes in Denver. The crew's did a fantastic job. Dinner served was good. Employee's were very nice. No trouble boarding. Plane was clean. I will fly with them again.
Nov 2019,50,Wonderful company - changed non-changeable ticket!,"I booked my non-refundable reservation to fly from WI to NM for a doctor appointment. But later the doctor appointment was rescheduled, and I needed to change the tickets. They did it, in spite of no change policy for the cheapest flight! Thank you guys."
Nov 2019,40,Decent leg room,This was a pleasant trip. Flight was on time. Service was pretty good. Surprisingly there was quite a bit of leg room.
Nov 2019,40,Older airplane,The flilght from AMS was on an older 777 model. The flight was pretty easy. The staff were friendly. The seats were ok as far as comfort goes. The entertainment was good but because the equipment was older it didn't work as well.
Nov 2019,30,Flight was actually early!,"Non-stop flight from Heathrow to LAX. No complaints about the flight other than the usual mediocre food, the inability to hear the inflight entertainment with the crappy little headphones they give you (buy your own expensive sound cancelling ones!), and cramped seating. The good part is that the flight actually arrived 1/2 hour early!! That meant 1/2 hour of not being cramped into a small and uncomfortable airplane seat."
Nov 2019,40,Surprisingly pleasant,"Prior to traveling to Chicago, I had heard all kinds of stories about the UA and was kind of dreading it. However, my experience was really good! From the polite flight attendants to tasty food to making sure we were comfortable, hydrated, not hungry - everything was really fine. Max points for the flight attendants!"
Nov 2019,50,United to Hawaii,"United did a good job of getting passengers safely from point to point. The gate agents and cabin crew were friendly. The flight was quite full which is typically the case these days but boarding was smooth. There is, of course, no dining experience in Economy but we were served snacks and drinks and were offered either a cup or the full can if the requested drink came in a can. There are snack boxes available for purchase and there is a reasonable selection these days. Entertainment is available via the United app; just be sure to download it before you board. Good selection of movies and TV available. All in all, a decent flight at a reasonable price."
Nov 2019,40,Helpful and nice,My only complaint is they didn’t help me find my gate for my next flight like they did previously. But I figured it out. They are helpful and nice. I will fly with them again
Nov 2019,10,Nice flight on United Airlines,"Flight was on time, boarded well, although economy, not a tight squeeze, friendly and accommodating flight staff, helpful."
Nov 2019,10,Don't take them to Hawaii,The attendants in Hawaii are awful.Charging for a bag being over by less than 1 lb. Harrassing my 5 yr old daughter by insisting that her American Girl doll was a carry on and we'd have to pay for another bag. On the plane was no better. Refused to let us sit together because one of the empty seats was a different class from what we paid for. Just all around horrible service. Won't fly them again if I don't have to
Nov 2019,10,This was the most cramped fight I have ever been on.,We flew round trip and it was horrendous. It was more cramped then I ever remember. My friends and I all felt the PTSD for weeks afterwards. The staff was very nice but understaffed. It was a space issue. Too little space for the number of people.
Nov 2019,10,What a mess!,"We booked a return from our cruise many months in advance and paid for Premium Economy thru Denver.  Weeks before our flight, we were rebooked on another flight departing 2 hours earlier and connecting through Newark.  Not only were we inconvenienced we were not booked into Premium Economy or Comfort Plus.  Two uncomfortable flights in basic economy and now we have to fight for our refunds of Premium!  Why, oh why do we fly United?"
Nov 2019,50,Love United Airlines,I've only flown First Class a few times on United and I must say the service is fantastic. We flew First Class going to C.R. and Economy Plus on the return flight. The service in Economy Plus was nice as well.
Nov 2019,20,Uncomfortable,"They continue to make the seats uncomfortable by reducing padding, restricting reclining angle, and narrowing them. Unconscionable. I hate flying."
Nov 2019,40,On time and good connections,"Like all airlines this side of the Atlantic, they are overpriced but, the flights were on time and even early in some cases. Very pleasant and helpful check-in staff. The flights were all jam-packed and the seats were pretty uncomfortable but, that applies to all airlines these days, unfortunately."
Nov 2019,30,Average,"We had happy attendants although the flight was half an hour late, aeroplane not cleaned and WIFI kept pausing all flight."
Nov 2019,30,Mixed experience - London to Washington,"Flight from London Heathrow to Washington was persistently turbulent which made the whole experience less enjoyable, although I appreciate this is not the airline's fault. Crew were not particularly friendly. Return flight was much better, crew were very friendly, attentive and efficient. United on-board meals need some improvement. If you like pasta in cheesy sauce or chicken in cheesy sauce then no problem but perhaps more variety and something a bit more nutritious would be a good option. Entertainment was good and seat pitch in economy more comfortable than others we have flown with. No delays either way."
Nov 2019,50,Very Good Flight,Good flight. Good entertainment system. On-time departure and arrival. Good service. Better legroom - but I paid extra for a seat in an extended legroom in Economy class.
Nov 2019,40,On Time,I normally fly United. One thing UA has improved is that fights are on time. The baggage arrival for business class was really fast. Still UA has not started offering Vegan food. High time they do it.
Nov 2019,20,Not great!,Ive travelled United a good few times and its not improved my views. Some staff are great whilst others dont interact well. They advise down loading their app to get WiFi or watch movies and it still doesnt work. Restrooms have been out of service on 2 recent flights.
Nov 2019,10,Unimpressed,"With Kona being such small airport I couldn't buy any lunch to take with me. The only thing I could buy to eat on the plane they ran out of on their flight from SFO. They don't restock in Kona. There was very limited entertainment and my sound only played music and sound effects, no voices...?? I don't recommend this airline."
Nov 2019,50,first class service no matter where you sit,"so nice to have the stewardess and pilot greet you! We went from USA to Italy and back. had a delay, but it didn't phase us because of the way we were treated."
Nov 2019,10,Unbelievably poor service,I have many miles and fly to Omaha every month. One month I tried to use miles to upgrade and the customer service people (in the Phillipines) tell me there are no seats available when there are clearly seats available. Unbelievable!
Nov 2019,10,United is the worst,On the flight could not get water. Could not get earphones. Was so ill and could not get assistance. I fly to Rome every month. Never again.
Nov 2019,40,"Return Flight was excellent - Economy Plus, Arrival flight was crappy - wrong terminal posted when I arrived.","Being 6'6"" Economy Plus is about the only way to fly with United. Great in flight entertainment as long as you have downloaded app before takeoff."
Nov 2019,50,Chattanooga to DC Flight,We arrived in plenty of time to prep for our flight. The Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport was clean; personnel was very helpful. The flight was very enjoyable and the United Air personnel served us very well.
Nov 2019,50,Not sure what this means!,"Gate service and check in service very good much improved. Congratulations to United. In flight customer service very good. Pilots kept us informed. Lots of drink service. Food/meal need different vendor - thumbs down. Eat before you fly, bring your own meals. Otherwise — was great!  A hui hou!"
Nov 2019,30,Murphy’s Law,"UAL canceled my flight 10 hours before a 7 am departure for a flight to Denver. Had to choose a flight out of Houston with less than a one-hour connection.    Flight was full with many electrical linemen from Louisiana headed for California to help with power outages. Flight was too heavy, so they removed luggage and one passenger. 25-minute delay.    Arrived in Houston with 25 minutes to get from Gate B to E (airport map said it is an 18-min walk) but the auto-plane docker over shot the gate, so we had to sit down so they could align the plane with gate. 15 minutes left to my connection departure.    I’m 70. If I had been less fit, there was no way to make the connection; and I ran up one escalator and a long flight of stairs, took the tram to Gate D, ran to Gate E and made it as they were closing the doors. Gave extra star because they waited for ME!"
Nov 2019,10,Reading is fundamental!,"Baggage handlers must not know what the big red tag that shows""PRIORITY"" means. United tells their passengers that their luggage will come off first, but United must have not given their baggage handlers that information. Pittsburgh NEVER has their priority bags off first. One would think United would give devoted passengers that one little perk, but I guess it's acceptable for United to say one thing and do another. The disappointment continues..."
Nov 2019,10,United Airline Sucks!!,"We had flown into Chicago on a nine hour flight from Vienna and were hurrying to catch our connecting flight to Birmingham. As we got to the gate we were told that the flight was delayed. Thirty minutes later it was announced that the gate had changed. An hour later we were told that the flight had been canceled. We were told to go to the United Help Desk (along with all the other frustrated passengers whose flights had been canceled)  FOUR hours later we got to the front of the line only to be told that the best they could do was fly us out the next morning to Houston and then later in the afternoon onto Birmingham. No apology or even any compensation - take it or leave it attitude. When I commented that I intended to take it to social media, the representatives reply was 'you do that'.  We were eventually booked on a late night flight into Huntsville, arriving at midnight. We then struggled to rent a car to drive three hours to Birmingham at our own expense.  To add insult to injury, our luggage had been lost in transit and didn't arrive with us. Once again, we had to stand in line at the Huntsville airport to put in a report. At least they were helpful.  We only heard back from a United representative FIVE days later to ask if we had received our suitcases. Lucky for them my husband had the insight to go to our local airport the next day and found out cases standing at the carousel. Not locked up safe in an office - just sitting out for all and sundry.  The worst part off this saga was the attitude of the United representatives in Chicago. Not at all sympathetic or helpful. The older lady at the counter next to us was crying and and incredibly upset.  I will never fly United again."
Nov 2019,40,Tough day,"This was a tough day for crew and passengers because of a VERY long delay. The flight was scheduled to leave SFO at 11:00 a.m.and did not actually leave until 3:45 p.m. The crew had flown from Boston, MA to SFO to replace the original flight and must have had an incredibly long day - but for the most part all the attendants were very professional, helpful, and friendly.    Understandably, United was trying to keep its passengers safe, but the late notice that the flight would be delayed - the departure time was changed three times starting at just three hours from the original departure time - made for a very long day. The overall feeling was that there was a general lack of communication between the mechanical crew and management.    The pilot was above board as to the arrival time - he made it with three minutes to spare! - and obviously was skilled.    I will continue to book United flights whenever possible and will encourage others to do so."
Nov 2019,30,United Airlines average for domestic flights,"United Airlines service to Orlando for a short Florida vacation is average for a domestic airline these days. I had no trouble with my carry-on in Newark, but I was forced to check the bag in Orlando for $30. The security line in Newark was very long -over 30 minutes - so give yourself LOTS of extra time before your flight. Otherwise, the flight was ok. Schedules were met and the flight attendants were reasonable."
Nov 2019,50,There is a difference here for sure,"First I need to clarify that I have flown just over 4 million miles in 23 years, and switched to Continental airlines when some time ago before the United merger. On this flight it was once again proven that if the crew is originally from Continental or what they call themselves lovingly as Ex-Cons, you can count on superior service. However if I manage to get a crew with lots of seniority on another flight the experience is obviously different.  I travel home through Houston many times each year and this crew is normal of the Ex-Cons. There is always friendly service and it is the reason why I switched after 2+ million miles with another domestic airlines. Airlines in the USA are not exceptional, but the service from the former Continental staff continues to earn my loyalty."
Nov 2019,50,2 Five Hour Flights Back to Back,Heading from Toronto to Maui required 2 planes. The regular economy section is not as jammed up as most other airlines so that was nice. The next level up with a bit more room was pricey but worth it for comfort. On all our flights the staff were professional and courteous. I’d recommend United for any trip and look forward to flying with them again.
Nov 2019,20,greed,"The new economy/economy plus thing is a greed tactic. Can't sit by your family unless you pay more. We got lucky since i paid for it all on my card that we were by each other going to cabo, but not on the last leg coming back. The Express planes now have more leg room than the bigger jets. We were so crammed into the seats, no leg room whatsoever and we aren't big people. I was actually getting very claustrophobic. This was a newer plane so it must be a new thing to squeeze in more passengers, as past flights with united were better. Maybe they got a new CEO? I would rather be comfortable and be able to move my legs than have a tv in the headrest. As a passenger I can bring something electronic to entertain myself, but I can't change the tight seat configuration unless I want to pay high $ first class. Very disappointing, Just when I was going to apply for the mileage card, I will avoid this airline if possible."
Nov 2019,10,Packed in like sardines!!,"Very budget style experience,fully booked aircraft,had to place rucksack under seat in front,very uncomfortable experience,not much leg room anyway,stewardesses unfrofessional,chewing gum,unhappily doing their job.food was garbage."
Nov 2019,30,"On Time, Easy Boarding, Cramped","Having a reliable plane, competent pilots, and helpful crew is first and foremost. These things all happened. Grateful for that. Also, flights were on time and uneventful - the best kind of flying.    Looking at particulars, overhead bins were too small for the bags they allow (on the smaller commuter flights) but I understand some planes are in the process of being retrofitted for that. I had no screen on the plane for the trip over so it made watching movies to pass the time more difficult. I had a screen and a newer plane on the trip back and it made a long flight seem much more bearable.    And we have surely reached critical mass on the cramming in of passengers. If you can afford business class or first class, do it. It’s not bad for a commuter flight or even an hour or two but nearly six hours of flight time coupled with another hour of boarding and waiting, etc. is pretty intense. We don’t have a lot of airline choices where I currently am but, given the choice, I would choose a more humane approach to personal space and comfort.    That being said, getting there safely and without ridiculous delays is the main thing and all that happened. Happy travels to you!"
Nov 2019,40,Non-frequent flyers,"The flight was delayed but left on the rescheduled time arrived on time in Houston. The airline failed to let us know that the flight was delayed three hours. The associate was rude when an inquiry was made about the new schedule. The meals were of poor quality and the same as the flight a few days earlier to Washington, D.C. We oped for the snack pack. I do not have much data to compare this flight with as I typically drive."
Nov 2019,50,Great flight from Wash DC to Rome,"Excellent Flight ... encountered delay upon leaving Rome due to mechanical issue... sounded very scary. Pilot was very helpful and told us the nature of the problem and the clever UAL workaround, which made us feel comfy enough to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. Even shortened the route and less of a delay. The food though is close to horrible; suggest bring your own food."
Nov 2019,40,Delayed but accommodating,I received a text message letting me know that the flight was delayed about 4 hours before. I was able to spend more time with my daughter and son-in-law as a result. Thank you United Airline.
Nov 2019,50,Upgraded to Business Polaris,"We purchased Economy Tickets for $700 roundtrip, then we upgraded to Polaris Business for 20,000 miles and $500 each way. This is a fantastic deal compared to the $8-11k roundtrip business class ticket. It was really worth it... 10-11 hour flight with ability to lay flat, have a private cubicle was great compared to the Cattle care service. The meals and service were great."
Nov 2019,10,poor service,"I've traveled to many places in the world and I am just shocked at how much the service at United Airlines has gone down. To have a 8 1/2 hour flight - no in flight meal, no in flight entertainment. No one comes around to even offer water after the first hour of flight. There were empty seats in the exit rows and rows with several empty seats and no one offers those to anyone. The man sitting next to me was very tall and cramped into a seat where every seat in the row was full - it would have been nice if they offered him to move. Will not pay the extra to fly United again - might as well do a cheap airline - you get no frills anyway."
Nov 2019,30,The main point is that the plane landed!,"Flew premium economy to Frankfurt and economy to Madrid. Able to sleep for a few hours which was important. Flight attendant gave us free spirits for first drink which helped me fall asleep quickly! Seems that there are more bathrooms now or at least fewer people in line. Lufthansa was connecting airline and there was no wheelchair at either airport. It had been requested and reconfirmed. However I did have the wheelchair on the return flights.I can't complain about anything because I used United miles so apart from taxes and premium upgrade charge, it was FREE."
Nov 2019,50,great experience,"Just great, although the seats were a litlle small, the check in process was smooth.  I had no problems at all, nice and helpful staff."
Nov 2019,10,"Understaffed, no communication","Early morning flight was 'delayed' (12 hours) because of mechanical trouble. We did not receive any notification. A lot of trouble to get onto another way later in the day, which was our only choice. Ended up missing activities we had booked on our vacation and lost money. Not the way I wanted to start my 25 anniversary."
Nov 2019,20,Not up to standard - shame on you,"Not up to standard. I'm not sure whats happening at United but this was the 4th flight we have taken with this airline in the past two weeks and on 50% of those flights there were problems with the personal entertainment systems, including missing plug jacks and defective armrest operators. To add insult to injury the one of the flight crew spilt tomatoe juice over my son, whilst the cabin was in darkness, and hoped to get away without an apology. Shame on you."
Nov 2019,50,Very few airlines are as compasinate as United,"Three days before my flight, my wife fell off a ladder and ended up in the hospital with surgery scheduled. I cancelled my flight and the lady on the phone kept suggesting that I rebook instead of cancelling. I explained what happened and the trip was to attend a convention she directed me to a web site to seek a refund. I filled in a single page questionnaire explaining why I cancelled. In less than 24 hours I got an email wishing my wife a speedy recovery followed by receipts issuing 100% refund of baggage and airfare back to my card. THANK YOU UNITED!"
Nov 2019,30,Reasonable flight but you have to pay for spirits!,"The boarding process was simple and straight forward, as a family of 5 they seated us together, which we have found not all airlines will do!  The seats are pretty standard, perhaps a little more leg room than I have experienced usually, but in economy, it's not much room. Thank god for having kids with us, to give the adults a little extra space.  The entertainment is really good, the videos can begin from the moment you sit down. The choice is wide and had some very recent movies, which I was keen to see.  The flight was smooth and the staff pleasant. The food was ordinary, not particularly good, airline food of years ago. They don't seem to have updated their food quality compared to others.  The biggest issue I had was that spirits were not complimentary, which I expect on long haul flights. I think they were USD$8 or $10 which I thought was ridiculous. So all the alcohol that was on offer was wine and beer, and the beers weren't a great range, and they didn't seem to have much of the better ones. This was really disappointing. I like to have a few scotches on my flights particularly as I don't sleep.  So all in all they were ok but the food and drinks were very disappointing.  If we hadn't got the flights in a Black Friday sale, I would have been pretty pissed!"
Nov 2019,40,Paid for extra leg room well worth it,Paid for extra leg room which was great as this also allowed us to take a case on with us each. Staff were lovely and we knew in advance food was not free so you could take on what you wanted or purchase snacks on board. Flight entertainment was included in price which you used an app to log onto before take off.
Nov 2019,40,Comfortable flight,"The flight was comfortable and the service was very good. I would give the food a B. This is not the best airline for international travel, but it is a good value for the cost."
Nov 2019,10,Left without a THIRD of the passengers,"Original departure 3:00. Every boarded and then pilot informed us that we were delayed 5 hours due to Chicago restricting air traffic. Ok, everyone off. Now departure is 8:10, then 7:30, then suddenly 4:55 with 12 MINUTES notice. TWELVE. The plane pushed back from the gate with 1/3 of the passengers NOT ON-BOARD and TOOK THEIR LUGGAGE. Inexcusable. Then the only gate agent disappeared for 20-25 minutes while 1/2 of the plane stood in disbelief, trying to figure out how to get to Chicago and how to retrieve the luggage the plane escaped with."
Nov 2019,50,First trip on UA to Cuba!,"Very pleasant trip and wonderful to be in Business Class. The staff was great and we had many funny laughs and not always like this on UA for sure.The food was ok , but as usual the wifi did not work. Smooth flight."
Nov 2019,10,"Chaos in the air and on the ground, and mendacity in the office","This was to be the last leg of our flight home: a 9:45pm takeoff, but no matter - home is home.    When we landed at JFK on the previous leg of our flight, we received an email from United, saying that the flight was delayed 2 hours because of fog at Newark. That was the start of the descent into chaos.    The car from JFK took us to Newark Terminal C - which is all United, top to bottom. It started out pretty well, self-checkin, short lineup, convivial agent. As she gave us our tickets, she said the flight was leaving from Terminal A, and because of the lateness of the hour, we should go there with our bags.    We arrived at Terminal A, to find a totally empty checkout counter, and one United agent. He tells us that oh, well, we should take our bags to Terminal C.    Before long, we had four people involved in trying to figure out what to do, all contradicting each other. It took a good 15 minutes for them to figure out what should have been a routine activity - i.e. checkin two bags.    Finally, we discover the truth. At 10:45 pm, an hour after the original departure time, I found out from the United agent at the departure gate (A26) that the aircraft scheduled for the flight had not yet left Rochester.    The truth finally came out. Instead of ""fog over Newark limiting the number of planes that could depart"", the aircraft was hung up in Rochester. The email that United sent us contained an out-and-out lie. It would not have cost United a penny to tell me the truth, but instead, it chose to lie.    I take a very dim view of corporate lying. Small lies lead to bigger ones, and they make for a company that I don't want to do business with."
Nov 2019,50,Weekend getaway,My wife and I decided to visit New York for a quick 4 days to see a couple of shows. United has special deals that you can find on their website. Our premium economy tickets were less than $300 apiece. We had to leave at 6am on Thursday and returned at 9 am Tuesday. The early flights were were worth the experience. The service was outstanding and everyone at United greeted us with a friendly hello and smile. Maybe going early everyone starts in a great mood. I highly recommend United.
Nov 2019,10,"Make America Lean Again, fly United!","I fly regularly to Asia from a minor airport, and my only “choice” is United. Even if you never try non-US airlines, you see easily that 1/many attendants seem to need to be attended to, and are not very willing/able to attend you 2/food is - always the same 2 options - plain terrible, with those terrible pretzels available as snacks in the back between meals. 3/the “friendly skies” are fake news.  I got an upset stomach several times in the last 10 months, and simply don’t eat anything on board anymore. Total rip off"
Nov 2019,10,Worst airline,The planes are always delayed and the excuse is always the same “ a mechanical issue with the plane” and the attendants show no sympathy and they are rude. They offer you old snacks and water but nothing else. This will definitely be the last time I fly this airline. BS
Nov 2019,40,United Rome to Washington D.C.,"I flew mostly U.S. to Asia routes on United, both business and economy class, therefore I am most familiar with United Airlines’ planes. I was surprised by the 767 that flew from Rome to Washington D.C.,the economy class seats are arranged in a 2-3-2 row arrangement, and quit roomy as compared with the Asiatic planes they used."
Nov 2019,20,Sad,"Usually try to avoid most American flagged airlines, but had no choice - the people (2) at check in were certainly lacking in any customer service - no greetings - no connection - no service . This was the beginning of a Long overseas flight and it was just sad on the check staff attitude to all who were checking in ."
Nov 2019,50,Brooklyn & Catherine Are AMAZING!!!,"Flying in United's new Premium Plus product was a first for me, and was a truly wonderful experience, as I love United's 787-10!    In addition to great legroom and seat width as well as large screens for seat back entertainment (all comparable to domestic First), the pre departure beverage was appreciated.    However, what really and truly made my flight and customer experience is the incredibly attentive staff- Brooklyn and Catherine were both absolutely INCREDIBLE, friendly, professional, and kind, and are among the best best flight attendants I've ever flown with.    Thank you United and Brooklyn and Catherine for making my experience so wonderful!"
Nov 2019,50,Wonderful Flight!,"Ken and Anthony were really wonderful flight attendants and I truly appreciate how helpful they were, and committed to the customer experience especially on such a short flight.    Thank you United, and thank you Ken and Anthony!"
Nov 2019,50,Great Staff- Thank You Gel and Selmina,The staff on this flight was simply fantastic! They really seemed to love their job and were highly committed to a very positive experience. Thank you!
Nov 2019,40,"Smooth flight, no problems","We opted to pay the extra for the Premium Economy and it was well worth it. This included many perks including the priority boarding, leg room, seat comfort and deplaning. Also the priority screening line. This was a long flight and the little extras helped make it more comfortable."
Nov 2019,30,Hope you don't have to go...,"Apart from the inflight entertainment at the seat not working (video but no sound), I broke my cardinal rule and actually used the restroom during the flight. I can't get over how narrow the toilet area was. As a woman, it's nearly impossible to ”clean up” without standing. Thanks for making an already uncomfortable cross country flight that much more uncomfortable."
Nov 2019,30,Poor communication,"Returning from an extended trip to Morocco, Portugal and Spain we were more than ready for our final flight from Chicago to Green Bay. Our 7pm arrival time had been changed to 10pm shortly before our trip. After getting through customs and grabbing a quick bite to eat we checked to see if there was an earlier flight to GB. We saw a 2:30 flight that had been delayed to 5:30. When we checked with an agent we found that there was plenty of room on that delayed flight. However there was not a full hour to make sure our bags would make the transfer. The agent did not check to see where our bags were. We were told that we could not go on the flight without our bags. After waiting more than four hours we boarded our flight and arrived in Green Bay. Our bags did not show up at the luggage carousel. When checking with a representative we discovered our bags came in on the earlier flight we had requested. It should have been easy to locate our bags and get us on the earlier flight. Think we will be sticking with Delta"
Nov 2019,40,"Flights good, and on time.","Overall very good flights. I have problems walking long distances and managing steps. I had a wheelchair waiting at DC where I changed planes. Nice employees and willing to help out. When making my request for a chair prior by phone a few days before my flights, the operator went ahead and assigned my seats on the aisle so that I would not have to walk over people. And, all the flights were on time."
Nov 2019,50,Nightmare Checkin,"6am to check in for 8:55 flight. Computers are down. How can you not have a back up plan? Lots of confusion.  Of course, this made the flight late. Most passengers had connecting flights—lots of anxiety  Hope I never have to fly United again"
Nov 2019,40,Lovely planes and great staff,Well our first time flying with united airlines. This was due to the callapse of Thomas Cook so had to have a indirect flight from Heathrow rather than a direct flight from Manchester. The flight from Heathrow to houston then to cancun was brilliant went very smoothly and the plane was lovely and comfortable especially the big on we went on for 10 hour. Staff was fantastic and food and drinks was spot on and was always offering us drinks which was lovely. Our flight back from cancun to Chicago was on time and staff Brill. The flight from Chicago to Heathrow was a little bit long as we had to turn back to Chicago 2hr 20min into our flight. Once back to Chicago got on a different plane but was on the ground for a very long time. We eventually took of and landed nearly 9hour later than planned but got home safe. This hiccup made our travel time extremely long. We left our hotel at 10am Tuesday morning and didn't get back home till 8.30pm Wednesday night we was travelling with 2 children who may I add did brilliant and staff did acknowledge that they did so well.
Nov 2019,10,Last time I fly this airline,"We were supposed to leave out on Oct 26, 2019 but instead we were told our pilots hadn’t had enough rest to we were delayed 3 hours which made us miss our connection in Chicago #1879 to Cabo San Lucas. So we had to either pay for our own room and fly out the next day or go home and fly out next day. We had 6 people on this itinerary and missed a whole day of vacation and hotel night stay in Cabo. Well guess what ? No one wants to give any money back or compensate us in any way ! It was a mess with 12 people in our group..... 6 made it.... 6 did not. We had transfers from the airport together once we got there and everything got screwed up thanks to UNITED AIRLINES! This will be the last time we use that airline !"
Nov 2019,50,Best Airline to fly to the United States of America,"Although the flight was delayed getting into London (due to bad weather in the USA), the captain and crew took special care of all the passengers and took the fastest route to land in Dulles. The aircraft was clean and the crew provided a seamless service. The entertainment system was awesome. The ride was smooth, bar few bumps due to weather condition. Overall, I was extremely satisfied with the flying experience and would recommend UA to all fellow travelers."
Nov 2019,10,Where would United Airlines be without passengers?,I’ll take the blame... I recently attempted a reunion with United... poor poor choice - DIA gate agent confirmed my thoughts by informing me customers are not important to their core business - I had my own suspicions (I say with the most sincere cynicism) but really appreciated her acknowledgment and confirmation - It’s why I ask ... “where would United Airlines be without passengers?” So good to know - finally!
Nov 2019,50,Ground staff and flight attendants were brilliant and very helpful,"We booked 6 flights from 7th October Dub to Washington, 14th Washington to Chicago 21st Chicago to San Fran 29th San Fran to Newark and Newark to Dublin. The last 2 flights were delayed and we were very worried , we might miss connecting flight. The flight attendants on San Fran flight due to leave 10.00 am 29th Oct. were esp. nice and made everyone on the plane feel relaxed and reassured . Even with the 2 flight delays , we had a very good experience, flying with UA. and its my pleasure to recommend them. Thanks from Maura . (Ireland )"
Nov 2019,30,"First class LAX to Honolulu, better than riding in cattle, aka coach, but NOT worth the money","The warm nuts are nice, but not worth the cost. The food was OK, but not worth the cost. The slightly wider seats were nice, but not worth the cost. The lack of screens on the back of the seats was definitely not up to first class standards. The chardonnay was fine, but I could have bought lots of cases for the cost differential.  Very nice crew.    If headed to the islands, save the money and have a stupendous dinner once you arrive in Hawaii or stay at a nicer place. (I wouldn't sit up front except that my wife really likes to fly in first class, and on occasion, I listen.)"
Nov 2019,10,Scheduled trip ended up late,The one and only time I will fly with express jet. The policy was great but the flight attendant held the flight up for an extra 30 mins because they did not know what they were doing. Would not recommend to anyone who has a connecting flight or has somewhere to be on time because the flight attendant can’t cordinate how to do there job in the correct order.
Nov 2019,10,Almost threatened to be chucked off the flight,"I have had 4 united airline flights in the space of a week. What I am writing about is the last one home.    Everything was going well. Got my boarding pass, not sitting next to my partner on the flight which isn’t a problem.    However I had a member of the United Airlines ladies come up to me and accuse me of sitting in the wrong seat. She came over as they had over sold the international flight. She had put 3 standby passengers to go in my row.  I politely informed her I was in the wrong seat or I had moved. I denied this and showed her my boarding pass. The showed I was in the correct seat. She was not happy and wanted an excuse to chuck me off the plane I had paid for a seat.  However the lady was adamant it had changed, surely I should of been informed this when I went to board the plane.  She still showing me a face like thunder when she called the desk outside to confirm my seat. Guess what it was correct.  This lady had double booked my seat with a standby passenger. I said I can move to one of the better seats down the front of the plane but she wasn’t having any of it. She angrily handed my boarding pass back and stormed off. No apologies or acknowledgement that she messed up.    If I had a choice I wouldn’t fly United again because of this incident.  One good thing the entertainment on board is pretty good."
Nov 2019,10,Worst air service I’ve ever experienced,"Canceled out flight. Couldn’t find us another one and then wanted us to spend 48 hours in two different places because they realized they booked me for a flight switch that gave me thirty minutes to recheck my bags.    Customer service is no help. I’m in a foreign country and can’t call anyone because service doesn’t work here. All in all, will not be flying United again. I hope you decide against it as well."
Nov 2019,20,"Teo Menus offer, one was” sold out”","Flight duration about 13 hours. This time I was satisfied because my display worked so I could enjoy the entertainment without problems (on another flight it didn't work and I had to share the headset with my wife and watch the same movie).  The surprise comes at dinner time. Arrived at our place, one of the two menus offered was sold out, so we had no choice but to take the remainder !! and so many others still behind us.  How can such a thing happen?"
Nov 2019,50,Great flight,"From booking to boarding everything went smoothly. Checkin was so easy and our flight was on time. The cabin crew looked after us so well, food and drink was excellent the only problem I had on the flight out was the jack for my headphones was broke therefore I wasn’t able to use the inflight entertainment but as the flight was full there was nothing the crew could do. But overall a great flight and would use United again."
Nov 2019,50,Great Trip,Wife and I take this flight several times each year and it is always a great experience. Crew is always very engaging and accommodating to our needs! Thanks!
Nov 2019,30,Don't pay for Economy Plus,"Crowded plane, average food and Premium Economy is simply what economy used to be before they squeezed in extra rows. The cabin crew looked tired and the food was bland. There was blood on my pillow. Not nice. The boarding at LHR is crazy, 4 different lines but we all go the same way at the plane door."
Nov 2019,40,Business flight,"Service was very helpful, I downloaded the United app which turned out to very helpful when return flights were canceled due to weather."
Nov 2019,10,Nightmare,"This was a flight from hell! packed in like sardines, the food sucked, inflight entertainment didn't work, 9-hour flight was longest ever. First time and last time I ever get on a United plane. Had I known when I purchased my ticket that the last part of the flight was getting on this crate I would have looked elsewhere. I fly Lufthansa which is a wonderful airline. United should take a lesson ."
Nov 2019,40,I have nothing bad to say,I would give it 5 stars if they didn't make passengers for checking bag. Flying international used to give free checked bags. Encouraging passengers to check their bags speeds up the boarding process. Who travels international without a bag?
Nov 2019,40,good service on united,"flew round trip on United, everything was on time and service was great. We connected in Houston in both directions and everything went really well."
Nov 2019,50,"Awesome flight, Service AND Crew","Flight was awesome as was the crew and service from Salt Lake City, Utah to San Francisco, and connecting to AMS"
Nov 2019,10,Truly Lousy Experience,"Truly awful. Consistently lousy. As a 2 Million Mile United customer, I have made this trip over thirty times for business in the last 8 years.... but with United it just keeps getting worse and worse. In my opinion, ANA is the best.... and more economical btw.... choice. Hands down, United does not deserve my continued business.... and that's why I've shifted over to ANA and Lufthansa for International travel needs. Sad..... used to be a great airline."
Nov 2019,10,Lost Customer,"Why United has lost me as a customer... I was flying from Orange County to Winnipeg through Denver. My flight left on time, I got into Denver without a problem, and actually arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. That meant I had an almost 3 hour layover. My flight landed at 2:40pm and my next flight was scheduled to take off at 5:23pm. However, when I got to Winnipeg... My bag was not there. Shocking especially considering the long layover time and the fact that I was flying first class (with a priority tag on my bag). When I did a bit of digging, I discovered that my bag wasn't offloaded from my first flight until 5:09pm... over 2 hours later!! My second flight ended up taking off earlier than scheduled-- 5:06pm. When I called the toll free number after filing a lost bag claim, I was told they couldn't even located my bag. Well, I needed it the next day because I was scheduled to fly to a remote lodge in the Arctic where the bag (and all my gear) would not be able to catch up with me. After being on the phone all day and tracking the flights into Winnipeg, I was told my bag would be on the morning flight as the evening flight was cancelled. Once the flight landed, I called to confirm my bag was on that flight. They said yes, I could go to the airport in Winnipeg to pick it up.    When I got to the airport, there were NO United representatives anywhere. I went on a wild goose chase to Air Canada, as they are partners. No one could help me there. I was taken to the United office-- no one there. I went to the lost bags office to the Air Canada desk-- they couldn't page a United representative or help me. They sent me to the information desk where I was told they could find someone to help me-- nope, I was told to wait outside customs for a United person to come out. Finally, some officers and a flight attendant came out. But they couldn't help either, and wouldn't help locate a United representative. I get it was the end of their shift and they work really hard and probably just wanted to get to bed, but they could have helped me for 5 minutes to get someone to help me. By now I've been in the airport over an hour. I wait by the door some more, and someone else comes out. He told me there was a phone I could call customs with. I call customs and finally someone was nice-- he told me he found my bag but no one else was inside to help me. He told me he'd find someone from United and he came back 20 minutes later saying he couldn't find a SINGLE PERSON who worked for United to help with this bag. Eventually, he was kind enough and processed my bag himself-- going above and beyond the care I'd ever expect from a customs agent.    As a frequent traveler, premier silver United Mileage Plus member, and a FIRST CLASS customer, I am shocked and disappointed at the lack of customer care from agents on the ground. They could not have cared less and constantly dismissed me. If I had not gone to the airport per the customer care support on the phone, I probably would not be staring at my bag right now. Sorry, United. I probably won't be flying anytime soon!!"
Nov 2019,10,Burned and burned again,"If I have a choice, I avoid United at all costs- even more after this trip. Pilot said they’d turn on the air since we were stuck on tarmac for a long time but he apparently forgot that little detail, so the Canadair jet became a hotbox. Flight attendant spilled coffee all over me and the tray, and didn’t so much as apologize after she covered me in coffee! Not nice, unprofessional and not even an offer of a napkin! Will avoid this grungy airline and its rude staff and fly better airlines."
Nov 2019,40,Long Flight in Economy,"Eight plus hour flights are a test of endurance and patience. This flight was quite full and there were few empty seats. Our plane was a 777 with a seating configuration of 3X4X3. Sat in a middle seat and slept very little. Young lady in window seat slept with her head on my shoulder for a couple of hours. Seat screens offered large variety of options, particularly movies. Served snack shortly after take off, then a full hot meal shortly thereafter. Very efficient and conscientious cabin staff served meals and beverages in good time. They offered frequent drinks of water throughout the flight. Flight was uneventful. Breakfast was warm and good coffee welcome."
Nov 2019,50,United Has Always Done All it Could,"United has always done the best they can on my flights, United cannot control the weather or what airport traiffic controlers area dealing with. Delays happen but I love the United App to keep me up to minute informed. This flight was on time, service was great and had no issues. I fly 35 weeks a year and realize that the ticker gate personel and flight crew are doing the best they can and it you treat them right it comes back."
Nov 2019,30,Too little for too much,"A trip for our 35th anniversary. The SEA to EWR flight was great in First Class from start to finish in every aspect. The lounge served probably the best Bloody Mary ever, really. And the lunch on board not bad. Arrived at the Polaris Lounge with 90 minutes to wait for our connection. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT CONSIDERING THE HYPE AND THE REASON WE DID NOT FLY WITH OUR USUAL BRITISH AIRLINES. Very little food was on hand and I should have known better but I did eat a bit of salmon and had a quick drink before heading to the gate. The salmon would try to swim upstream for the next few days. On board we were introduced to our coffins we would occupy for the next seven hours and we had high hopes. Unfortunately the disinterested cabin crew and overly warm cabin added to mediocre food service made this a poor experience. Access to the United Arrivals lounge and post flight shower at Heathrow was a plus but was tiny in comparison to other airlines. Ok, it sounds like I’m feeling entitled and being needy but having paid what we did I expected better from United. Further I have been a MileagePlus member since 1993. Our return was on Lufthansa from Frankfort in business... a much much better experience for less. I would suggest Cathy Pacific, BA, Air New Zealand or Lufthansa Business and Premium Economy over United...too bad."
Nov 2019,20,Why United Airlines has lost me as a regular customer,"The date was October 17, 2019. I left the hotel at 6 am to be at Newark Airport 2 hours before the 8:30 am flight. The flight was reports as on time departure. At 7:30, the flight was reported as delayed until 9:30 for maintenance. At 9:00, it was reported as delayed until 11:00. At 10:00, flight 934 was cancelled. I stood in line with other passengers to get another flight. First, I was told the next flight would be the next day! Then suddenly, there was a flight leaving in 20 minutes (it had been delayed 24 hours!) and I could get a seat, but it was at the other end of the airport.    I sprinted the length of Newark Airport. Got to the gate in time. The agent assured me that my checked baggage was on board. The flight left 3 hours after my original flight was scheduled. When it arrived in London, I was informed by baggage was not on the plane. It would arrive the next morning. This meant standing in line for 30 minutes to fill out missing baggage claim. I was told my bag would arrive at my hotel by noon the next day. By this time, my reserved car ride had been cancelled based on my original flight being cancelled.    I arrived at my hotel at 1 am, not the planned 10 pm. The next day, by noon, the bag had not been delivered. I called the United baggage delivery service. ""The bag will be there by 3 pm."" It was not. I called again. ""The bag will be there by 6 pm."" It was not. I called again. ""The bag will be there by 8 pm."" Unlike the previous falsehoods, this proved to be true. The bag did arrive. I invite you to count the lies that were told to me, starting with the gate agent.    The bag contained by business clothes for presentations I was in London to make. I made my presentations in my travel clothing. The bag contained my music and stage clothing for a performance the following day. It did arrive in time for that event. However, I was quite stressed for nearly 24 hours wondering if the bag would arrive.    I paid a hefty fare to fly business class. This is not the service I expected. United has fallen to the bottom of my airline choices, even though I have silver rating in Mileage Plus. Also, Polaris Class is not exceptional compared to other airlines. Business class on Alitalia, as an example, was superb.    It is my hope someone at United read this critique."
Oct 2019,30,Retrun Europe to US,"I don't get why United just can't compare with their code shares like Lufthansa. Flight attendants were ok, but they seem to disappear halfway through the flight. Can go aft and get beverages always. Arrive not exhausted, but not refreshed."
Oct 2019,30,late short hop hone,"Made last flight and was concerned about weather, but all was ok (a little bumpy, but I felt safe, and they flew as best as could be expected."
Oct 2019,10,Worst service ever!!!!,The attendant (one) was very rude!! Flight 1656. A passenger next to me reported a broken headrest and she jumped down his throat!!! He was just letting her know about the problem. Then they didn’t have enough documents for the flight to enter the country. No power supplies on the plane. I personally won’t fly United ever again!!!!
Oct 2019,40,Good flight,This was the first leg of a longer flight and we also flew Munich to Newark on the way home. The flights were long but the service was good.
Oct 2019,40,Nice,Nice aircraft. Nice staff. Nice seats. Nice complementary selections. Had a nice rest after a long night.
Oct 2019,40,Partner airlines,This was a partner airlines of United and was Skywest. This flight was on a very small plane and scheduled for 1.5 hours but made it 1.25 which was very good. 2x2 seating and very cramped. The earlier flight at 10:28 was a larger plane but was not able to stake any standbys!!!!!
Oct 2019,40,Quick Flight to Burbank,An alternative to flying to LAX and worth the trip!!! Flight was originally 1.25 hours but made it in 49 minutes. What a relief to get in early!!!!!
Oct 2019,50,efficient and easy flight,"We flew United roundtrip from St. Louis through Newark to Geneva and then Geneva to DC to St. Louis. The entire experience was great, all connections easy and on time and the flights themselves smooth with great service from all flight attendants."
Oct 2019,30,A Long Trip Home,United tends to book connections to close especially at busy airports like O'Hare! Though our original flight was on time we sat on the tarmac waiting for a gate for more than 30 mins. Had our connection not been delayed for 3 hours we would have missed it because the connecting gate was a 20 minute walk! Lesson learned!
Oct 2019,10,Can’t be worse service,"They staff are anger with everyone.  If wasn’t for a rush fly in SF, I would never ever book United. Avoid it at all costs."
Oct 2019,40,Direct flight from SFO to MEX,It was a typical flight from SFO to MEX. No frills and basic. Our family often flies with United on international flights and have no real complaints.
Oct 2019,40,Baltimore to Chicago,"Staff was friendly and boarding was efficient. The plane had new seats which is nice. Although it is a shorter flight, for breakfast both inbound and outbound, only muffins lacking any nutritional benefit were served. Just sugar, refined flour and fat. I would expect an option for yogurt, fruit, hard eggs - something decent. I have noticed a serious dip in the food quality compared to the competition which is disappointing. Also, an issue that may not be United's, but at the premier check-in at O'Hare there was no option for TSA, so even though it was faster we had to take off shoes, coats, sweaters and all the other from our carry on - so essentially we had to get redressed and repacked."
Oct 2019,20,No Customer Service,"Can't say enough bad about this experience --- round trip. No notice from United as to from what terminal the outbound flight was leaving. On the way back, no way to check in on line and pay for luggage --- had to do that at the airport. AND, while they had my Trusted Traveler number on the first flight --- it magically disappeared when I was coming back. Seriously? And heaven knows, no notification ""time to check in"" or ""thanks for flying with us."". True --- the flights left mostly on time and arrived on time and we didn't crash. So that's the good news. But I'm extremely unimpressed with their on-ground pre-flight service. Really ---- how did my Trusted Traveler number disappear????"
Oct 2019,20,United is Deaf to Customer Feedback,"United has become the behemoth that thinks it's too big to fail -- and too big to listen to customer feedback for that matter. When pricing out a ticket to virtually anywhere, United is virtually always the most costly option. Their rewards program is definitely not the easiest to use with a lot of restrictions and a website that lacks a true user-friendly interface.    Flying them is literally a pain in the butt. I'm not sure what model they are using to simulate the average person, but all one has to do is glance around the plane to see that seat sizes do not match up with the average American body type. And the cushions might as well be non-existent. I can literally feel the frame of the seat in great detail on the five-hour cross country flight. The leg room and knee room aren't sufficient for even small people. And the universal move to charge for luggage means that every overhead bin is stuffed and the boarding process is much slower and laborious. You did this to yourselves.    Service is another area in which they lag behind. While there are friendly, polite flight attendants, there are also plenty of battle axes with a chip on their shoulder who get annoyed with even the smallest service request. Case in point: on my recent flight I pressed the call button and asked if a flight attendant could throw out some garbage so I didn't have to step over the people in my row to get out. They have a visibly annoyed look on their face.    Get with it United. Many low-cost carriers offer far better customer experiences. When are you going to realize this and start treating travelers like customers and not passengers?"
Oct 2019,10,DELAYS,"First our plane was delayed heading down to Cancun, luckily we still made our connection in Houston. The main issue was flying back home from our Honeymoon. Our flight was delayed flying out of Cancun to Houston, which was making us miss our connection to Seattle. We were notified morning of, with very little time to figure our other options. When we got to the airport it was complete madness. When we finally got to the desk we were told there were no other options but for us to take the flight to Houston that takes off 5 hours later than original flight, miss our connection, stay overnight in Houston, then take a flight back to Seattle at 7 am. Ok, it sucks but fine things happen. What really pissed me off was we were not given ANYTING for our troubles. Didn’t give us a hotel in Houston, didn’t give us food vouchers for the money we would now be spending in overpriced restaurants, not even free checked bag. NOTHING. I have flown United in the past, always delayed. Never flying United again"
Oct 2019,30,New England visit,The airline staff were very helpful in helping me upgrade and everything was great until our plane broke in Washington DC. While we were waiting on a replacement the baggage handlers left our suitcases in the Pouring rain for hours sitting on the tarmac. Still waiting on a reply from United and probably will not hear back. Still up in the undecided if I would fly with them again.
Oct 2019,20,UNITED THROWS OUT ITS FREQUENT FLYERS,"As a 1.5 million miler and a 1K-it is sad to see how United is treating its frequent flyers in 2020. As a 1K miler, I fly over 100,000 miles a year, United has now let me know and other 1K members that are loyalty is no longer needed. Now instead of flying 100,000 a year, it is being based on how much money we give to United, not based upon the miles we fly. A horrible way to treat their most loyal customers. Until there is a revolt against United's senior management, they will continue to treat the customers that help keep United profitable like the bottom of the barrel."
Oct 2019,40,United Express,"This was a no frills, small plane (United Express). Perfect non-stop 3 hour flight from Louisville to Denver."
Oct 2019,50,Great trip,"It was a great trip from St George through Denver, and then on to Lincoln. On time flight, and plenty of time between flights. Great service from the SkyWest crews."
Oct 2019,20,Tightest seating in the industry,"Not sure any normal human being can sit in those seats. I was fortunate the middle seat was empty, otherwise I probably would have had to stand the entire flight. Stop treating people like cattle and provide a comfortable way to travel!"
Oct 2019,10,Pover,"United Club Lounge LA  Very poor lounge ,    United Airlines check-inn : staff stands there and see you struggling with check inn but don’t move a finn : useless staff"
Oct 2019,40,Indianapolis to Aruba,"Very good staff, boarding was easy especially the immigration being done in Aruba. Then the connecting fight from Newark to Indy was easy and had time to get a bite to eat at the airport in Newark"
Oct 2019,40,Efficient Airline.,"We traveled from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood airport to Vancouver via Chicago O'Hare airport. A good no-nonsense airline. On time operation, no frills, dry and efficient. Least hospitality. Clean washrooms, nice aircraft interior. If one wants safe and convenient travel this is the airline you will oft for."
Oct 2019,50,Great customer service!,The whole crew was so friendly and helpful! It was a great experience! We bought some of the snacks offered by United and they were good. The flight attendants served beverages throughout most of the flight.
Oct 2019,30,Delayed flight,"My wife and I were flying to Ontario for business. We had to change planes in Denver. The flight leaving Houston was very late, and we almost missed our connection. It was fortunate that our departing flight was at a close enough gate where we could make it in time. The troubling factor was the lack of support from the flight crew. Only one announcement was made, during the flight, to allow those with connections to depart first. I think more could have be done to assist. Some did miss their flight."
Oct 2019,30,Don’t Book Basic Economy,"Memphis isn’t a hub city for personal travel and it’s difficult to get a direct flight. Therefore when I do find a direct flight, it’s exciting. But do not book Basic Economy. I was informed that if I did not check my carryon bag at the ticket counter that not only would I have to check it at the gate, I’d also have to pay a $25 inconvenience fee. I was ok that I couldn’t choose my seat, but that whole forcing me to pay for a carryon suitcase was ridiculous. Otherwise, smooth flight, but foolish of me to book a flight that was scheduled to arrive at midnight."
Oct 2019,10,BACK SEATS WHERE LEFT OUT,"When it came time to order off the menu, the flight attendant said "" oh we are out of everything, when you sit in the back thats what happens"" So everyone in the back dod not get to eat. Me and my wife were hungry and we did not eat in the airport knowing we would eat on the plane. This airline needs to hold more meals so that everyone gets to eat and no one is left out."
Oct 2019,50,Good flight back home,"We had a good trip from Madrid back to Newark on UA50. The flight departed on time, the food was good as were the drinks and entertainment. We had basic economy and two seats, A & B, one window and other on aisle. We did have a minor glitch after landing when there were mechanical issues with the deboarding tunnel. We were stuck on the plane for about 20 minutes till that got fixed."
Oct 2019,10,United has gone completely downhill! I would give them a zero of I could.,"I have never been more disappointed in an airline. I had a short business trip Tuesday to Wednesday and every single plane was delayed! In fact, I had to get on an american airlines plane in order to make it to my conference yesterday because I missed my connecting flight. And again today both planes have been delayed. They supposedly have said each delay was due to maintenance issues! I can understand weather delays as that is no fault of the airline, but maintenance delays they have control over. I would suggest flying frontier or spirit veggie booking a united flight!"
Oct 2019,10,Worst airline for customer service.,They charge you for Carry on and if you want to sit together you have to upgrade which was higher than the ticket. Flight attendant talking bad about travelers with baby to other flight attendant.Will never fly them again.
Oct 2019,50,Cart ride,"We are an older couple and my husband has trouble walking...our gate was changed and without the help of Stephanie Johnson, (Supervisor Airport Operations) we would have missed our flight....Even though she is Supervisor, she jumped right in, got us a cart and drove us herself to our new gate.....thank you so much....."
Oct 2019,10,"Never, EVER again!","WORST AIRLINE EVER!!!!    In total for this trip we did six flights, four with United and two with American.  Before we left Sydney we were told we would regret our airline choice and no truer words were ever spoken regarding United, though definitely not with American.  The only positive comment I can think of about United is that they have a good variety of movies for in flight entertainment - and that was only available for the long haul sectors, the short haul, even though they were the best part of three hours each, only had entertainment available via personal device - a system which didn't work on either flight.  The following review is mainly based on the long haul legs of our journey, but applies equally to the short haul legs.  Firstly the cabin staff are rude, abrupt, unhelpful - everything you DON'T want in cabin crew, United deliver in spades! It appears to me that United only hires unsmiling cabin crew, because on my total of roughly 37 hours flying time with United, I never saw one flight attendant smile, say please or thank you.  We paid to upgrade on all legs to economy plus and on our flight home our row and the row behind us were completely forgotten for breakfast (and we were supposedly the first ones to be served) and when I queried where our meals were, we had to prove we hadn't somehow hidden our trays, garbage etc (and I'm talking ten people this affected) before the meal was thrown at us with a terse ""eat quickly as we are landing soon"" the only verbal acknowledgement.  Secondly the meals are horrific - and this from someone who doesn't mind airline food. Breakfast on our flight home was cinnamon toast with stewed apple and chicken sausage - I mean who would put that combination together? It was foul and inedible (maybe the steward that forgot to give us this meal was trying to do us a favour).  Thirdly the seats are horribly uncomfortable. I've never had trouble sleeping on planes and I am of average size, but neither myself nor my husband could sleep due to how uncomfortable the seats are and how loud the cabin noise. As economy plus we had more leg room and recline than standard economy seats so I feel immense pity for the poor buggers in the standard economy seating.  Fourthly the bathrooms are tiny (not unexpected) and after about an hour into the flight, terribly dirty and I don't believe they were cleaned throughout the entire flight on either of the long haul legs - something I have NEVER experienced on flights longer than four hours.  Fifth and final point, the cabin of the plane was dirty on both long haul legs with garbage and old newspapers under the seats from previous flights.    In summation, I have flown with many different airlines all over the world.  I am an easy passenger - I don't ask or expect much, just a reasonable level of polite attention and as comfortable a seat as one can reasonably expect. I always upgrade to economy plus or economy x or whatever the different airlines call it as I usually don't need all the extras that come with the thousands of dollars asked to fly business class as I never have trouble sleeping or eating on a flight, but I do like the extra leg room the small dollar outlay provides, so I don't think of myself as an unreasonable critic nor someone that only posts negative reviews - I like to balance the scales and give credit where due, BUT UNITED AIRLINES DOES NOTHING TO DESERVE ANY CREDIT!!!!  In complete honesty, if I were to win a trip flying United I would sell it off, I will never fly United again under any circumstance.    If I can add a quick piece about American Airlines, who were the polar opposite to United! Lovely, warm, friendly, inviting crew, comfortable seating, clean toilets and cabins. I will definitely fly American Airlines again."
Oct 2019,30,A320 should not seat 2 large men and me next to each other.,Thank God I was on the Isle seat because the two guys next to me took up all of their seats and extended it to my seat which only gave me 3/4 of my seat and i was hanging our into the isle. They had to push me back in my seat to get the beverage cart down the isle.
Oct 2019,30,"Quite a few seat changes, a delay, and then an upgrade to Premium Economy","After doing online checkin 24 hours before the flight, my seat was changed a couple of times apparently due to equipment changes. The original airframe that was to be my flight was delayed, so they put in a different 767-300 for my flight, but this one didn't have premium economy class, so I went from 32F to 18K. Then an hour later, United was able to apparently find another 767-300 with premium economy class to replace my initial airframe and then I was given seat 38F way in the back. I got online on my phone in the United app and was able to change back to 32F. By the time I got to the airport and in line to board with group 1, my seat was then upgraded to 23F in premium economy. What a pain to go through this back and forth. But ultimately, I was happy to be upgraded for my first time flying United Premium Economy. The seat is nicer and there's a better meal but for those using the overhead compartments, it's still the same old 767-300 overhead compartments where roller boards don't always fit and sometimes the luggage have to go in sideways resulting in 3/4 compartments; as well as the middle aisle compartments being a bit bigger than the window side compartments. Food was okay, buffalo chicken, a new one on me, basically chicken breast cooked like a buffalo chicken wing but boneless and with hot sauce. Additionally, these new premium economy seats have a bit less room underneath the seat in front of you, so, if you primarily use this to stow your carry-on shoulder bag, there's less chance of it fitting since the space is smaller due to electronics."
Oct 2019,20,SLOW BOAT TO Chicago,This flight is only 400 mile and takes 2 hours or average for 200 miles and hour for a E 175 twin engine Jet. But that is only the beginning if you have a connecting flight it a mile plus walk to get to your departure gate . Make sure you take your running shoes.
Oct 2019,40,flight was fine...slightly delayed,"the only complaint was the quality of the food in first class. it was a 4 hour, early morning flight, and the only meal in first class was granola and yogurt. I was disappointed that there were no omelets or warm options.    other than that, the flight was fine."
Oct 2019,50,AWESOME SERVICE,United took wonderful care of me and the flight time to Dc was reasonable. No delays while traveling
Oct 2019,50,On time and comfortable seats,"United Airlines has the 24 hour cancellation policy which is great when plans suddenly change, My flight was great, no complaints!"
Oct 2019,20,Pick up rescue dog.,"Late, late, late...both coming and going. Not helpful at all with rescue dog. Had to sit 6 hrs while waiting for crew to arrive, Will NEVER fly United again!"
Oct 2019,30,Nice flight to Denver,Nice Flight to Denver then a mile walk and train to get to departing Gate at Denver. This did us in and we just made it to the gate in time. Signage at Denver SUCKS!
Oct 2019,40,All good.,"Pleasant staff, good selection of movies, tasty food (yes!) and cleanliness in all areas. I've been flying United (Continental as they were known) for many years and will continue to do so."
Oct 2019,40,tight fit in coach but it was direct with no delays,"No complaints, offered snacks and drinks. We were very tight together which is to be expected but it was a short flight so no big deal."
Oct 2019,30,Too Small of airplane.,"This is a Very small air plane for the distance, single seat next on one side of the isle and 2 on the other. Very small seats and no room for putting a backpack under the seats. if your over 6 foot don't plan on standing up straight."
Oct 2019,10,Honeymoon delayed,"Please share this post. DO NOT FLY UNITED AIRLINES. Today was supposed to be the most special day for Eddie and Heather going on their honeymoon and from the first flight to the last flight United airlines employees and flight crew have screwed this whole day up. On the first flight the flight crew was late to work and their flight was delayed due to United airlines employees, they almost missed their second flight connection in Newark going to Jamaica. The flight that they had to rush to catch sat on the tarmac for an hour and then went back to the gate because the crew had a problem. This is the worst United Airlines experience ever but not the first bad experience with United Airlines personally. They will be 4/5 hours late arriving for their honeymoon in Jamaica all caused by United airlines employees. Personally I think United airlines should fire these employees because if those people don’t want a job or get to their job on time they don’t need their job! It’s not like they’re typing behind a desk they are messing with peoples travel plans, people‘s vacations, peoples connections and what does United Airlines do? They will send you a voucher for another flight with United airlines, after this experience nobody should fly United airlines. Very very horrible service very very horrible customer service. Just wanted to let y’all know"
Oct 2019,40,Great flight,"No delays. Attentive staff. You do not need to dload the app for inflight movies as advised in the departure lounge. Meals OK but no option to omit cheese when pre-ordering so limited choice. Salads were not fresh, but rest of meal decent. We also had coeliacs who were catered for well. Good movie choices and chance to sleep too. Exceptional checking in and baggage reclaim. No fuss. Thanks UA!"
Oct 2019,10,My First and Last Time Going On United Airlines,Worst airline ever! Seriously my family and I have been stuck in Tokyo for 8 hours!! We’ve been delayed at least two to three times and our flight got cancelled!! My whole family have been sleeping on the floor. My nephew is also sick and my grandma can barely walk! Literally this is the worst airline I’ve ever been on!! THIS WILL BE MY FIRST AND LAST TIME BEING ON UNITED AIRLINES.
Oct 2019,20,Sardine in a Tin Can,"Our mistake was that we booked ECONOMY with United Airlines.  They nickel and dime you for everything. One would assume you would get 1 free checked bag when flying from USA to Ireland. That’s a big fat NO! 1 checked bag for 1 way is $60. But wait, that’s not all.....if you want to ensure you sit together, you need to pay extra for your seat, minimum $68 per person per flight! So 2 people flying with 1 layover = $68 x 4 = $272 plus the 1 checked bag fee of $120 = $392 on top of the ticket price. Oh....but there’s more.... you get the pleasure of printing out the baggage sticker yourself, fastening it to the bag, dragging the bag to another counter and dropping it off. And of course you either printed the boarding passes at home or use the phone app ( which didn’t work at the Orlando airport). And to put the cherry on top of this messed-up airline you may squeeze yourself into seats that make a 9 year old child claustrophobic. Not even going to start with their “food service”.    Note: Flew direct with Lufthansa (Economy) from USA to Germany this summer (during high season) and not only was my ticket cheaper, there was no checked bag fee, no seat selection fee, didn’t have to check my bag on my own, the service was superb and the food was great."
Oct 2019,10,From Excellent to Terrible: my trip!,"Since my last trip flying United was excellent, I thought going to London and later from Madrid would be excellent. I was wrong! Pro: It was a great flight from Chicago to London, food was the best part. I wanted to try Indian food option and I picked that and the selection of food was great. Loved the chic peas with rice and all the goodies that came with the service. It was a great way to end with a mango ice cream! It was a smooth flight and everything was great.    That was the good part. Now, the horrible and terrible part. The flight from Madrid was a joke, a terrible experience. This is how it started... We were seated and suddenly something happened, we weren't informed until one hour later sitting in the plane that there was a device or phone in between the seats. Was there a device? They never found anything in 3 hours of search. Now common sense is that if they had a scanner they would have scanned the area for a device, right? But they didn't. I think United needs to upgrade on that part, if something like this happens, the hand scanners for searching or seeing objects would be h andy to detect where is the device or the object. Long story short, the flight was grounded, meaning canceled. It was a terrible show.    We were sent outside and imagine what was given for lunch... something the animals won't eat either: Cold sandwiches from the shop across. They could have given us a voucher to go to Burger King and just get something good. But no, they provided us with something terrible. It was horrible. You may think that these people who are working might have some sense of placing people in flights, but no. We were sitting, instead of getting connecting with other flight partners such as Iberia, United decided to send us to a hotel. Pro: The hotel was great. It was Marriott. Good choice. Imagine we were awake since 5 in the morning. The Marriott experience was great, good hotel, good food.    Next day, we were sitting in the plane again and then again delaying the flight for ""weather problems"" in the route. Wow, signs of terrible service were lingering. We sat for about an hour or more and they came up with an alternative plan which was insane as well. Finally we were in the air. Now, the airborne food service. I wish that or would like to ask United that they should train people well to handle and serve food better (especially in Madrid). We were given doggie bags!!!!! Imagine the food from the other day kept in these bags, the sandwiches were slabs of disgusting chicken, remember I picked the vegetarian option. And the food that was served to me, had a chicken breast, dry as a saw dust with dry rice, just was like animal food or worse. IT was a terrible experience from flight and food perspective. The only good part was the ice cream served.    Decision: Not flying United for a while. I hope the management would read this and improve upon or train better their personal. For now, United is discarded from my flying list, I would pay a little extra and fly another airline. Thanks but no Thanks United!"
Oct 2019,30,Best thing I can say is we had an early arrival,"We hadn't flown United in some time. This is was unusual route for us and United had the best price and time. We each only had a checked piece of luggage so we opted for Economy Basic and then purchased the checked luggage at airport. Both ways, they separated my wife and I. From Denver to Charleston they told us based on our ticket they had little choice, but at least tried to put us together. From Charleston to Denver they said there was nothing they could do. On the return there was another couple in economy basic that was separated. So, it leads me to conclude they separate economy basic customers on purpose. We rarely by seats on Frontier Airlines and they have never separated us. They told us to try asking people to move on the plane. On the outbound the person next to my wife chose not to move (two seats per row) which was his prerogative. The person next to me was a child across from her Mom and sister. Didn't even ask. On the return, the person next to me agreed to move. So we got to sit together. During boarding, economy basic boards last. The gate attendant announced, zone five-economy basic can now board. Are you kidding me? Kind of cemented my belief that United is discouraging people from buying this level of ticket. On board, I drink my four ounces drink quickly and asked for refill. I was told no. Couldn't hear the reason, but it didn't matter. I did like the entertainment choices and the flights ran on time or early. Flight attendants were the least friendly of SWA, Frontier Airlines and United. But were professional. Overall, they will stay in third place among my three options in Denver. United sent me a survey after the flight and I stated all this. Not a peep."
Oct 2019,40,Flight was mostly okay.,"Weather delayed it a bit. Staff is nice enough, not the friendliest in the skies though. Snacks were delish, stroop waffles! Leg room was decent, again not great. We got tvs on the short part of the flight and nothing on the long part, was strange. And there are bag fees. :-("
Oct 2019,50,Pleasantly surprised,"This was a first time flight with United and I had been warned to expect last minute changes and a not so enjoyable flight. But I was pleasantly surprised when none of that happened. The flight was great! It left on time, the seats were comfortable and the crew was friendly. I actually told the pilot as I was leaving that as a first time flyer with United I was definitely going to book with them again."
Oct 2019,10,Worst airline I’ve ever had the displeasure of flying with.,"We fly every year somewhere international, sometimes twice a year. This was our first time flying United that I can ever remember and it will certainly be the last. Their economy seats were the most uncomfortable seats I've ever been in. I understand economy isn't supposed to be that great but considering I do it all the time I know what I'm in for. We had to fly united as they were the only airline offering economy seats at the time and date we needed and ended up paying more than we normally do for seats that were worse than the cheaper airlines we usually fly on. The flight attendants weren't rude but they were short and not the friendliest. There were delays both going to Singapore and then coming home, both times causing us to sit on the tarmac 45 minutes and we almost missed our connecting flight coming home and had to leave baggage in San Francisco. We upgraded to economy plus coming home and it was only mildly better. Another ridiculous issue was that they couldn't get seats for us sitting next to eachother when i'd bought the tickets several months in advance to the flight. We found they'd split some other couples up as well and were able to do some in flight seat swaps with other split couples and at least got aisle seat next to each other. Every call to customer service I've made regarding all this has not been good, generally with someone who's english isn't the greatest and after promising vouchers and flight vouchers to make up for their shortcomings they still haven't sent anything as they promised. I'm so disappointed they're an American airline and it's sad that airlines from other countries are outdoing them in our own country."
Oct 2019,30,Typical Travel Issues,"Unless paying a fortune for last minute travel, all economy seats are pretty bad which is a shame. Higher costs, less comfort and less attention to detail. Would be great if all of the seats mattered regardless of cost."
Oct 2019,50,ERJ 175 More Comfortable than 737,"My outbound trip (UA 3477) on 10 Oct was on an ERJ 175, with return on a 737 on 17 Oct from BWI.    Even though the ERJ appears smaller from the outside, the economy 2 + 2 seating gave more legroom and seat width than the 737.    On shorter trips such as mine I would choose the ERJ over a 737 or Airbus every time.    My return flight (UA 1411) on the 737 was delayed 45 mins due to a mechanical issue. In something right out of the Discovery Channel’s “Air Disasters,” a warning light indicated the flaps would not deploy properly on takeoff. The pilot had the issue checked, it was resolved, and all was OK.    Boarding on both flights was efficient and quick, even though both were nearly full."
Oct 2019,30,Surpisingly good flight,"Our return flight from a trip to Italy was a Lufthansa flight on a United airplane. Surprisingly, the economy seat in the back of the plane had far more legroom than we experienced on other United flights during 2019. The meal service was slightly better than last year's international flights, too. The entertainment offerings were good and I actually watched two movies; usually do not do so. Maybe United is finally realizing that happy customers lead to more profits and long term stock price increases."
Oct 2019,30,Flight Crew Great...Ground Crew Not So Mich,"A repair had to be made on the plane before we could fly. Rumor had it that it was known when the plane arrived that morning, but the repair wasn’t started until after the last pre-flight check. We were left sitting ON the plane at the gate for four (4) hours. Not that the crew didn’t try to get us off, but the airport supervisor wouldn’t let us off. We were only given a small bottle of water and small snack bag. They repair was not approved. Then we were finally let off, had to collect all our luggage, wait for hotel (3 hours in line), bus to hotel (40 minutes ride), dinner at 10 PM, breakfast at 7AM, then be ready by 7:30 AM to return to the airport. Flight was rescheduled for 2 PM...why so early? Because it would take 2 hours to get checked back in, then go through security, etc. Finally we got in the air! But please...get a new chef for the food. And a salad should have more than a few pieces of wilted lettuce, and a few other veggies."
Oct 2019,50,Why the bad rap? My preferred airline for sure.,"I don't understand why United always gets such a bad rap. I fly a lot and for me direct flights is one of the most important factors and United seems to have more direct flights than any other airline. It also helps that they tend to come in less expensive too. I check multiple airlines when I book travel and United seems to always be the most convenient and least expensive.    I am also a fan of their app and texting notifications. The app works seamlessly for boarding passes and the text for flight delays and boarding updates are very useful.    For the most part the flight attendants are excellent and friendly. Every once in awhile there is one who is not in a good mood, but that true in nearly every service job.    The seats are decent. Not the best not the worst, just decent. But I am comfortable for shorter flights and OK on the longer ones.    The most consistent complaint I have is that often the headphone jack didn't work and therefore watching anything on the seat screens is impossible. But we all have our laptops or tablets with us so we find other entertainment.    Overall, United Airlines has been a good, direct and inexpensive airline with good communication."
Oct 2019,40,"Direct flight, on-time, not full","Pros: direct, left on time, arrived a little early, wasn't full so had and empty seat next to me.    Cons: I was sitting towards (but not right at) the back of the plane and I could smell the toilet (before we took off). Service was mixed: one flight attendant v good but the other appeared to be in a grumpy mood."
Oct 2019,50,Pleasant Flight,"Nonstop flight from LAX to Cancun. Upgraded to premier access for more leg room and early boarding (worth it for my husband with a bad back). Uneventful, which is good for a flight. I like that United let’s you pick your seat (important for people who need the end seat to get up often)! Inflight movie was fine.  Check in was easy at LAX, needed help checking in at the airport in Mexico though, employees there were happy to help."
Oct 2019,40,Good but not the best,"Check in at the Premier/Polaris desk was efficient and polite. Dedicated Polaris lounge which had great food service. Gate area was very busy and by the time they pre-load all the special groups, you are not really Boarding Group 1 anymore, but about group 5. The line for Group 1 gets longer all the time as they seem to use an upgrade to group 1 as a reward.  We always wipe down the trays, remote and armrests as soon as we board because they don't seem to clean the planes very well.  Amenities were laid out on the seats but one of the kits had already been opened and the toothbrush used, so obviously they didn't pick them up after the previous flight and distribute new ones.  Food service was fine even though the food is mediocre. They did offer snacks throughout the flight.  Flight departed and arrived on time.  Luggage was arriving by the time we cleared Passport Control and Customs."
Oct 2019,50,Decent room around my seat even in economy,"The check-in service was seamless. The flight was on time. Attendants were pleasant and helpful. There was plenty of room for carrying on bags with no extra charges, which was delightful."
Oct 2019,40,First time flight into Paine Field,"We were excited to be able to get a direct flight into Everett WA from Denver, CO. The airport is brand new, opened in April of this year! It was minutes away from our hotel. Flying out. Was even better, 2 flights out at 6 am means very few people in the TSA lines. Upgraded to extra legroom on the flight back."
Oct 2019,20,Terrible experience,"Flying from Boise, Idaho through Denver, Co, destination Orlando, Fl. We were delayed in Boise because of bad weather in Denver. Flight initially delayed from 1 PM to 3 PM. But weather cleared in Denver so the plan was to leave Boise shortly after 1 PM. Pilots were on plane, but flight attendents did not arrive until 2:15. They were notified at 1 PM that we were ready to take off. Due to the attendents arriving late, we missed our connection to Orlando, had to spend 13 hours in airport. United would not pay for a hotel, they said delay was an ""air traffic control issue."" This is a lie. The flight attendents did not arrive until 1 hour,15 minutes after they were notified. Boise is a small town, it should not have taken them that long to get to the airport. Sad to say, I doubt any airline is any better. We avoid flying as much as possible."
Oct 2019,40,Flying with United,"This was a long flight. Over 7 hours. I expected to be miserable but I am happy to say that my flight was not bad at all. Our plane was set up as follows: 2 seats by window, 3 seats in the middle, two seats by the window. We were in a 2 seat aisle and I had enough leg room to be comfortable and able to sleep. The selections of movies and other entertainment were quite good. I found the food to be tasty. All in all, I was happy with our flight and would choose United again. Best of all, both coming and going, the flights were on time!"
Oct 2019,50,"Amazing airline, surpassed expectations!","I was very impressed by United Airlines. I installed their app on my phone before leaving which meant I had all my boarding passes at hand. I had connecting flights on the way out and back and using the app means that I was advised of the departure gate before it was announced in the airport - very useful when you're connecting.    The staff were very friendly everywhere, from the ground staff at the gates to the flight attendants.    I had requested vegan meals and they were the best meals I've ever had on a plane. Wow. So impressed.    The choice of films was overwhelming, never seen so much choice before!"
Oct 2019,50,Awesome Staff,Great service from the counter staff. They helped us to retrieve my Mom’s checked in luggage due to Mom’s passport was inside that luggage and needed at the TSA. With no hesitations they immediately do above and beyond. Cheers to all the awesome staff👏
Oct 2019,50,Fab,Never flown with this company before - but would definitely fly again. Our experience from beginning to end was fantastic.
Oct 2019,40,A 7 hour delay on a flight from Denver to Frankfurt,"We had flight booked on Sunday, September 1, 2019 from Denver to Frankfurt, with a 7 hour layover before connecting to Salzburg. After boarding the plane in Denver, the pilots announced that there was a problem with a wing flap. Long story short, it took several hours for maintenance to fix the problem and then they needed to get a new crew (on Labor Day weekend). After a 7 hour stay at Denver International, we finally departed and arrived too late to connect to our flight in Frankfurt. There is also no United desk in Frankfurt, so we had to ask the information desk for help, who ended up calling United in the U.S. to rebook us. We arrived in Salzburg at 11:00 p.m. and the car rental place was closed. To United's credit, they did offer miles and a ticket credit, although I could not use the credit when booking online, and had to call United to be able to use the credit."
Oct 2019,10,Horrible service,No entertainment system (not broken just none on flight). No pillows or blankets. They had 1 small flute of champagne for mimosas. Distributed wrong declaration forms. Rude and snickering flight attendants. Why fly first at all. In coach seats had NO leg room
Oct 2019,40,An all day flight,This was an all day flight from Amsterdam back to Texas. I usually find when flying west I try not to sleep much even though this was a 10 hour flight as it helps me readjust my body clock.    Flight crew were good and by age looked quite experienced. Food was so so.
Oct 2019,40,Predictable in such a good way,"The only thing uncomfortable about this flight was getting from the gate of a prior flight arriving on a different concourse to the departure gate of this one. The check-in process was easy, the attendants very courteous and smiling and the plane was clean."
Oct 2019,50,"Great service, start to finish",This trip was set up shortly before we left Spokane but we were attended to like old friends. Top notch service from check-in to arrival. United employs professionals. We even got the exit row for a little more leg space.
Oct 2019,20,nobody really cares,This airline does not really care for its people. The check in was Ok but at the gate even for business class there was arrogance for boarding. I had asked for wheel chair but nobody provided one. on the flight there was complete non care - sometimes you feel guilty in asking for anything. The dinner and breakfast is served as if being served by robots with no human touch. I did not like the hospitality at all; i wonder what is it to travel economy ???
Oct 2019,30,Better flight than last one,"This was my connecting flight and it was a lot better than the first one. Other passengers made this a horrible experience. We were delayed 30 minutes because someone dropped their phone in the bin and maintenance had to come get it out due to fire danger from the battery. There were other passengers that were simply annoying. The movie selections were ok, not as up to date as anticipated. Both flights had some older stewardess that were really slow. The seats were not very comfortable. The deplaning process was the best part."
Oct 2019,10,Worst experience I’ve ever had,"I travel ALOT and this was the absolute worst experience I’ve ever encountered. I bought a basic economy ticket because I travel very efficiently (usually with a backpack), but because of this I was not allowed to even checkin online or at the kiosk because this airline wanted a human to “verify” I had no oversized luggage. To make matters worse, Because I could not at least checkin even as a “United frequent flyer member” i arrived at the airport almost 4.5 hours early and there was not one person at the United counter and the kiosk was disabled. I (along with several other CUSTOMERS) waited in line for at least ONE HOUR before anyone showed up. However, the kiosk opened about 10 minutes BEFORE any humans showed up and once again I could not use the kiosk as indicated I could do online, because a human had to verify I was not checking luggage. This process wasted 2 hours of my time just to get a boarding pass when I should have been able to do this online or even at the kiosk. The seat was comfortable enough and we arrived early so I was able to make my connecting flight without an issue. I was NOT happy with this process."
Oct 2019,10,Food was crap and seats were very uncomfortable,The seat was really uncomfortable that I thought I would literally pass out in-flight. I got a very bad back and neck ache when I arrived in Japan. The food was also terrible that I passed on the last one. I've had better food from other airlines even if it was economy.
Oct 2019,10,Worst Seats Ever!,"What kind of idiots approved the design of these seats!!!? That was torture! To have a concave seat is downright the worst design on the face of the Earth. We will not be flying with United again. The plane was a piece of junk as well. The flight attendant could barely close the overhead compartments. There were screws loose on plane door, we had to wait a hour and half to take off. People spend a lot of money to fly these planes and that's just a slap in the face."
Oct 2019,40,Very Good Flight,United has improved greatly over the years. I like the current boarding group process. The customer service is very good. The seat was comfortable. The service on the plane was very good.    United has generally improved on-time performance in my experience. Usually the landing at the destination is ahead of schedule.
Oct 2019,40,Shorter than the flight in,"Arrived at SFO from Burbank CA on a United flight, landed in the domestic terminal and walked directy from the gate to the international terminal without having to undergo the pesky and unneeded security check that is usually part of the connection process. Lack of staff? Late at night? Getting a better grasp of what is necessary?  Anyway, we found our boarding gate and went off to look for something eat while waiting to board. Right across from the gate was one of the best offerings. So, we got something there to chomp on.  Before boarding we underwent a security check at the boarding gate. Specifically for this flight. Staff handled it well.  The plane departed on time.  On board the crew was very good throughout the 13 plus hours we flew nonstop to Israel. Only fly in the ointment: instead of offering a breakfast at the end of the flight they served another dinner which had the same menu as the meal we were given shortly after boarding. A pity. Not terrible but a sign of poor judgement and lack of imagination. A bit more creativity would have left a better taste in my mouth.  The plane landed on time. Luggage came off the belt within a reasonable time. Ours appeared midway."
Oct 2019,40,Nice flight,"Its a flight, not much to say. The seats are very small, and not enough feet room, but I'm not going to pay extra for business class or first class. Other than that, everything was great."
Oct 2019,40,Haven't flown United in many years and was very pleasantly surprised,"I haven't flown United for many years. I'm a regular traveller to the US and years ago had a bad experience flying United (poor food, not great service, not great plane layout), so when I had a last minute trip to arrange the United flight option gave me a good price (lot cheaper than other options) so decided to give them a try. I'm glad I did. The overall experience was excellent, from the app for checking my details and checking in, through to the lounge and boarding. Everything worked really well. We were a little delayed leaving LAX but not so much that it affected my schedule. Staff were very frlendly and helpful, and the food and drink options were excellent. Business class seat was very comfortable. All in very pleased with the experience."
Oct 2019,10,"Really, really rude flight attendent ""catching a ride""","Sat next to what turned out to be a flight attendent who was catching a reduced rate of travel. He wasn't on duty.    He was in the aisle seat, I in the middle, my spouse in the wondow seat. Immediately upon sitting down I heard, ""you're touching me"" and variations of ""you're trying to touch me and you're leaning into me !"". Being a mental health practitioner for over 35 years I thought, ""a troubled person to vex my flight, ah well"". At this point let me say I have pretty broad shoulders and a 54 inch chest. Part time weight training. I arranged for him to have another seat by requesting help from a flight attendent. My row mate declined the seat. Instead he ""jiggled"" his right leg against me for about 2 1/2 hours. If you're a parent you know the answer here - ignore it and the children give up. It worked ! Unfortunately he decided to cough ""cupping his hand"" until his spittle flew in my face. Taking the high road I offered him cough drops. (Let me say I'm rarely this much of a saint. I heard comments from fellow passengers that I should have ""clocked him"". But what would that prove ?)    At flights end I offered my hand and related, ""Even if it was an unpleasant flight for you let's depart as friends"". He mouthed ""a**hole""(Let me say here I scored some MAJOR points with my spouse for my forbearance.)    His ""cough"" was evidently contagious. For me it became a viral throat condition which lasted throughout the two weeks we were in Ireland. Thankfully I appeared to be over it so I could return on a flight in good conscience. Not to be !    Returning home I went to my doc who related I was about to be hospitalized for pre-pneumonia. Instead we took an aggressive medication approach.    After a few weeks I can say I'm fully recovered. 5+ weeks darn it !!!    United Airlines - ""Putting the 'hospital' in hospitality !""    What's surprising is we were always quite close to the flight crew - in the last few seats from the back. They did nothing to help their colleague - nor we passengers."
Oct 2019,10,Stupid Boarding Process,United boards the economy paying customers prior to the economy plus so that the economy plus passengers have no room for carry on bags.    This is a scam they put in place to sell you priority boarding.    What a low life company.    I only use United when there are no other options.
Oct 2019,10,Horrible airline,I will never stray from Delta again. United has the absolute most rude employees ever. Spending too much money to have them be rude. They made me check a backpack on the way home but not on the way here. Just a way to get money. Be the last they get from me or anybody else in my circle if I can help it.
Oct 2019,40,Overall quite good!,"The first leg, I was very ill, after taking strong medication. I was leaving myself a voice note on the plane at the gate, when the attendant yelled at me for being on the phone, which I wasn't, it was in airplane mode. Otherwise, he and all the others were great. United has direct TV so there are a lot of movies and shows to watch.  The return flight, everyone was wonderful. I was bummed it was the same movies, but I was able to find something. I feel like American has a lot more options, and you can order when you want vs direct TV it starts at a specific time. We will be taking this same flight again in 2020 and I'll be happy to use United again then!"
Oct 2019,50,Great convenient service from EWR-NAP,Great and convenient flight from NYC area to southern Italy. Left Newark in the afternoon and landed in Naples in the early am and enjoyed another full day of touring and eating.
Oct 2019,40,vegas trip back,very nice flight back to boston from vegas. very spacious seating and comfortable.would recommend to other travelers.
Oct 2019,10,Horrid Customer service,"I travel very often for work, and am limited to airlines because my local airport is a United hub. I had to cancel a flight in July due to work schedule changes and received an email notice that i would be getting a refund.    I never received that promised refund.    After several calls to ""customer service"" where they make no attempt to help other than book another flight and charge you again, I have gotten nowhere. 3 promises to have a manager call me and almost 4 months later, and still nothing but excuses and avoidance.    I have booked over $2000 in travel since July and that means nothing. They want me to book ANOTHER flight woth them and use a flight credit ap they can hit me woth another $200 fee...this was admitted by ""customer service supervisor"". If i had cancelled within 24hrs of booking, i may have had better luck i was told...who books a ticket and gets wind that they need to cancel 24 hours later? I book weeks/months in advance.    Seriously considering moving to another area just to be closer to another airline hub.    WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER EXPERIENCED."
Oct 2019,50,SAN FRANCISCO TRIP,"Excellent flight no delay, on time departure and arrival, very comfortable seats with good services. Also direct flight."
Oct 2019,30,An average airline,"I can’t recommend this airline, as nothing separated them from all other airlines. They charge you for everything. Look around for other airlines, but if United is your only option then take it."
Oct 2019,10,Disappointing and Terrible experience - Be aware!!!!!!!!,"This is the firat time that i'm flying with united.  I must say that the behavior of 2 Stewards can impact a whole experience.  those stewards was assign in our row zone and their service , answers and behavior was absolutely disgusting - from ignoring , Disparaging answers and rudeness.    Be aware from booking this airline."
Oct 2019,40,Direct flight to Tel Aviv,"I didn’t fly with United for more than 10 years. And I was pleasantly surprised by service they providing now. Seats were comfortable, restrooms and arounds were clean. Food wasn’t bad as it could be. Flight attendants were helpful and friendly. But, selection of movies and TV shows was pretty old."
Oct 2019,10,United Airlines frequent flyers discriminated,"I am a 30 year loyal customer of United Airlines. I pay a lot on regular flights to build points on their Frequent Flyer program and also pay extra for United Airlines club. Twice this year when flying on “points” I got bumped from flights. When discussing with gate agents, their answer is “Well, you are flying on a free ticket “. Recently, I asked the agent if they were “discriminating” against frequent flyer members tickets ... and I got a shrug. I also nicely mentioned to the agent that the free ticket comes because I buy a lot of “paying” tickets. Once again, I got a shrug. I can only say that UA ads do not match the loyalty trust that should be of greatest importance in any business. I just booked next full fare First Class ticket on my next flight on another airline."
Oct 2019,10,DO NOT USE UNITED OR SILVER AIRLINES!!@,Had 530 reservation mco to hsv. Delayed n finally cancelled at 7pm. No alternative flights. Told to contact united for refund. United after 1.5 hrs on phone said contact silver airlines. Silver did not offer alternate route. United wanted next day MCO to Chicago to wisconsin to alabama. REALLY ??? NOT!!! AVOID.
Oct 2019,50,Friendly Skies,"My husband and I had a great flight. It was a long flight, but we were very comfortable and the flight attendants were great, even the food was good. They changed my husband's seat prior to our flight home, and I paid extra for his seat. I spoke to the agent in Rome and he refunded the money."
Oct 2019,30,I am a million miler pushing the second million and 1K for the last 15+ years,"Until Oscar Munoz took the help, it was a great and friendly airline. I've been flying it for a very long time. Usually, 20+ trips a year, many transatlantic or transpacific. Oscar and his crew have made it a money-making machine, where loyal customers, even 1K are not appreciated. Now, they are making achieving 1k next to impossible, focing you to either fly 54+ flights a year or spending 24,000+ USD. I hope Oscar will get fired by the board. My company is leaving United."
Oct 2019,40,"Borgheim, just the way we like it","Flight was uneventful, connections made no issue, bags arrived with no issues. Just the way it should be."
Oct 2019,10,Very bad service,Staff very rude and unpleasant. Not smiling. Not helping. No consideration for travelers and babies.
Oct 2019,10,United Airlines is Way Worse than Frontier Airlines,"My flight was dangerous!!!! United Airlines is way way way way way way way way way way worse than Frontier Airlines!!!! The employees at the check-in counter at EWR said I can't eat anything at the airport (not even at a restaurant post security) or bring any food or drinks onboard this flight to Beijing (not even in a carry on). The inflight meals tasted not only terrible, it tasted unsafe and was unhealthy, so I screamed really loudly when I took the 1st bite of both meals!!!!!!! The lavatories had poop everywhere (including on the door). This was my unsafe and worst flight experience ever. It was way (10000000000000000000x) worse than Frontier Airlines (the low-cost carrier). United is the most unusual airline in the world! Never fly on United! United wants to make me hungry and feel in danger!"
Oct 2019,50,Great flight,Friendly staff very helpful with everyone’s different needs pleasure to fly with them comfortable seats plenty of leg room
Oct 2019,40,Check directly with the airline.,"With all of the so-called ""discount"" Travel Aggregators offering ever-changing ""deals"" on flights today, the very act of booking one has claimed it's own part in the many miseries and frustrations of post 9/11 air travel. We are manipulated by mathematical computer algorithms that seem to have much more to do with hidden agendas and information harvesting than in genuinely offering the most convenient flights and cost savings. Case in point: we recently needed to arrange flights from Washington, DC to Cancun, Mexico and back to meet two other people for a holiday. After checking with several well known travel sites and attempting to weed through a kaleidoscopic deluge of dozens of mostly unsuitable times, terms and prices, I threw in the towel and said, ""screw it; United flies direct from Dulles to Cancun. Let's check with them."" What a relief. In minutes the airline provided a near perfect flight time at the best price with the least hassle. The others booked and re- booked through the usual suspects that we all have tried, and we were the only ones happy. Thank you United."
Oct 2019,40,Wheelchair user,"I booked this trip via American Express using my points. I called to confirm about two weeks prior to departing. Excellent customer service given to accommodate my husbands power chair and his extra non power chair. Seats given in the bulk head made getting on and off he plane my easier. My husband is paralyzed from the chest down, thus needing an aisle chair and much assistance getting into the seat. Every united employee that we encountered was very helpful and professionals. Baggage in Washington was a wee bit rough with his chairs. I realize they are heavy, but its the only way he can get around. He was hit by a car while riding his bicycle in 2001at the age of 45."
Oct 2019,40,"United, this guy is a happy camper!","Hello folks!    Let me first start by saying this review involves 2 flights, both on United. My first leg of the trip is from Las Vegas to San Francisco and second leg is from San Francisco to Singapore.    So here goes the first leg, the Las Vegas United ground staff was very helpful, kind and helped me check-in my luggage (I had 1) so that it will be on the connecting flight to Singapore from SFO. She had a little trouble but after consulting someone over the phone, it was good to go. The flight to SFO was on time and smooth, it even arrived 20 minutes early and I was happy about that.    Second leg is from SFO to Singapore, since my luggage was already (should be on the flight) all I had to do was walk over to the International terminal without going through the TSA check point. Flight was on time and boy it was a long flight time, I think it was 16 hours. I upgraded my seat to Economy Plus and am I so glad that I did that. It was money well spent especially for a long flight, that extra leg room sure made a huge difference! If anyone is contemplating an upgrade to Economy Plus seats on a long flight I will certainly recommend it.    The flight itself was uneventful, which is expected. I've flown United on international routes before and I must say the In-flight meal is still nothing to rage about. I suppose the people in the economy section will not have a good tasty meal. It's probably better to grab some sandwiches or sushi to-go before boarding and have that instead. The flight attendants were great, they were friendly, attentive and of course professionals. In-flight entertainment is as usual, tons of movies, music, etc to kill some time. I didn't sign up for in-flight internet because the price was in my opinion outrageously high ($40 for the duration of the flight) and what you get for that price is meager download speeds, enough to browse the web, send/receive emails without huge attachments, and that's about it. Not worth the money.    Finally landed in Singapore around 6:30pm - jet lagged, lack of sleep and hungry. Couldn't wait to check into the hotel and get some ""real"" food and sleep. Thanks for reading my review. November will be another flight on United, that will be to Tokyo and stay tuned for a review on that adventure. Until then stay well and safe travels!"
Oct 2019,20,Disappointed,"We tried to check in online the day before we left Bangor. However, it said we needed to see an agent. When we got to the airport we were told we would have to check our carryon bag because we were in economy. That doesn't seem hardly fair. That's why we took a carryon so we wouldn't have to wait to retrieve our bag at the end of our journey. Don't think we'll be flying United again if we can help it."
Oct 2019,40,Friendly return,"Effortless check-in at Geneva. Smooth boarding by sections and comfortable seats on a middle-aged 767 configured for international travel. With the exception of one male FA, whose skies were stormy, on-board service was excellent and the food was remarkably good. Hassle-free immigration and customs at IAD added to the pleasant experience. One suggestion to United: Please find a pleasant replacement for the ear buds that don't fit well and seemed designed to keep one from hearing the audio."
Oct 2019,40,Friendlier skies,"From lounge time at Dulles to a before-schedule landing at Zurich, the international flight was one of the best ever on United. Credit goes to the lounge personnel, the ground staff at boarding, the flight crew greeting and the service during the flight. Credit also to the 787, the pressurization to a lower altitude and higher humidity make for a much more pleasant journey--and little or no jet lag afterwards. Extra legroom was a definitely plus--as having no one in the middle seat. Food service was well-timed, and the food was quite good. (No jokes about airplane food after this flight!)"
Oct 2019,40,Good Airline,United Airlines is one of the airlines that fly out of the airport in Baton Rouge. The planes are comfortable and the flight attendants very nice. It is more convenient to fly out of Baton Rouge than driving an hour an a half to New Orleans.
Oct 2019,30,Cramped,"Unfortunately, I was stuck with my Government ticket and couldn't upgrade. With 24+ hours in an airplane I wasn't looking forward to this flight. Once we were in the air, I was further nickel-and-dimed by food and internet charges. Further, the food wasn't at all tasty and was served, though expensive, portions."
Oct 2019,40,"Smooth flight all the way, just what we have come to expect.","Started with breakfast and cocktails in the United Lounge - now we know the vacation has begun. Smooth flight all the way, just what we have come to expect."
Oct 2019,40,Gradually Getting Better for International Flights,The flight was on time and uneventful which meets expectations. The food is getting better on international flights (forget discussions about domestic flights) and is nearly on par with other European rivals. I booked through Lufthansa but was a United flight.
Oct 2019,40,Good and friendly.,"We completed 5 trips to New York to Chicago, Vegas, to New York back to Manchester.  All comfortable and I am 5'9in. The Chicago to Vegas had no TV Screens but did from Vegas to New York. Cross Atlantic the air hostesses were really lovely and kind.  Note you can't upgrade seats on app unless you have an American Credit Card and you must check in on 24 hours if you want the best chance of being seated together."
Oct 2019,10,Lost first class seats for no reason,"Four months prior, we booked a first class round trip to Honolulu on United. We’ve planned and saved points for years for this vacation. We decided to fly to Honolulu and then on to Maui so we could enjoy the pods and sleep during the 8 hour flight. Initially our Houston to Honolulu flight was delayed by 6 hours as they worked to resolve mechanical issues. We had to rebook the Honolulu to Maui flight twice because of the delays. Once we boarded ours trip was uneventful.  Upon checking in for our return trip to Houston we found that our first class seats had been rebooked to premium coach. We were given no notification of this change. We would not have authorized this. We want to know why United Airlines chose to change our seats without notification"
Oct 2019,50,A stunning rainbow-flavored sunset,"Boarded the short flight as a burning red sun was setting in the horizon. Long after it had gone off to brighten the skies further west, there was a wonderful afterglow which accompanied our plane alnost the whole way to SFO. Barely enough time for coffee and a tiny bag of pretzels befire we descended. A perfect ride. Departing LA via Burbank airport made the entire experience so much less painful than usual. Easy access from the freeway. No lines to check bags in or go through security. No long treks between stops along the way. Much like a country bus station or small train terminal."
Oct 2019,40,shockingly excellent experience on United!,"I live near a United hub so I tend to fly them a lot - most often the flights and service are sub par. However that was not the case with these two flights. Granted two of the flight attendants on the return trip were surly, they were the exception, so I am excluding them from my review.    Both flights were on time, my seats were comfortable and the food was acceptable. Most of the crew went out of their way to make the passengers comfortable and see to our needs."
Oct 2019,50,Good service short flight,Paid for First Class Service. It was good but on reflection costly considering we slept most of the way.
Oct 2019,10,Terrible and tasteless Gluten Free dinner,"Doesn’t matter the class, United doesn’t treat GF people at all:  The food at the lounges is NOT marked as GF, and there are very few options to choose from.  The food served in the planes ( all classes of service) is tasteless and none edible- no alternatives!!!, only dry chicken and tasteless rice!!!  The snacks in the airplanes mostly have Gluten.  United should learn from the other Star Alliance airlines how to treat GF people!!!!"
Oct 2019,10,Horrible Flight Attendants,"My experience with United Airlines was awful. My flight from Buffalo Int airport to Chicago International airport was horrible. The flight attendants were extremely rude. The younger woman with curly hair was passing out snacks and gave the Caucasian people extra snacks but when I asked for an extra snack she said in a loud irritated voice that she needs to get through the cabin first. Unfortunately the same plane and same flight attendants were in my second flight to Sacramento International airport from Chicago. And in this flight the male flight attendant seem miserable at his job my mother asked for coffee and then she asked do you have sugar and he said well you need to let me know if you want sugar and cream in a rude way. The flight attendants claimed they gave away all their earphones in the previous flight but in reality they did not even offer headphones in the flight from buffalo to Chicago. Also the flight attendant spilled water on my brother because she was distracted. Also, when the pilot spoke the speakers were low and it was difficult to understand him."
Oct 2019,30,Consistently mediocre,"Have not been having much luck with this airline lately. Premium economy seating that feels just like coach, an app that shows United Clubs & Lounges but don’t actually take United Club Passes, a flight that runs out food, a dead TV monitor, and now a dead power outlet. It doesn’t feel like I’m “flying the friendly skies”. If you really want to improve, I suggest you start by retiring those ageing 737s. The overhead bins are turning yellow."
Oct 2019,50,Flying United to their Chicago hub can be comfortable and efficient,The on time 7:05 am departure on a flight that is not overbooked is a good start.  It was a regional jet with adequate seating space. Flight was smooth and the cabin crew was courteous and provided pleasant refreshments. On time arrival at a nice terminal made for the flight to be a fine experience.
Oct 2019,10,No Frills - Flyer Beware,"We had the unfortunate experience of flying basic economy on United Airlines from New Orleans to Charlotte in early October 2019. We had never flown this class before and should have looked into it more before we booked. The night before the trip, we learned we didn't have assigned seats and if we wanted that , we'd have to pay a fee. It seems the airline purposely seats couples separately in hopes of having them pay the fee to be seated together. We also learned we couldn't print out boarding passes in advance and needed to check in in person at the airport. Then we learned we were not allowed to bring our small bags on board and had to check them for a fee of $30 per bag. Finally we were in the last boarding group and placed in the back of the plane. On the trip dow we took American on basic economy and it was much better. By the time you pay the fees for assigned seats and checking bags, I wonder if basic economy. If you're thinking of booking basic economy and have never done, consider the above negatives. Flyer beware!"
Oct 2019,10,Change flight without notice,"I purchased a non-stop flight round trip from Hong Kong to Chicago on 8/6/2019. The flight date is 9/28/2019 - 10/6/2019. The flight number was originally UA 896 and 895. I got the confirmation that day. Then, when I checked in at the airport on 9/28/2019, I was told the flight was changed to UA 864, 624, 2297 and 197. And it's no longer non-stop flight. They didn't send me any notice before that day. So I have to change my itinerary by a lot. I spent hundreds of money changing my connecting flights. They act as a child did some bad things and don't want the parents know that. Then when you know it, it's already toooooo late. I hate this stupid airline company. Will never chose it any more."
Oct 2019,30,Good & Bad,"Positives  - Able to choose seats while booking  - Flight crew was nice  - Fair rates for our trip  - No delays and arrived earlier than expected to our destination.    Cons  - Checked bags = extra fees! I think at least one checked bag per customer should be included in the airfare.  - Check in agents (both ways) are some of the rudest I've dealt with. I feel for those who are new to flying and have to deal with those attitudes.  - No WiFi onboard  - The first plane needed a good cleaning, the second one was just a little better."
Oct 2019,20,Low budget airline,"I flew from Melbourne Australia on Qantas to LAX then transferred to United airlines to fly to Chicago. The staff were unfriendly and the seats were hard and had very little room. Food and drinks are not included in the fare so you have to pay extra.  When we arrived and picked up my luggage, they had caved in the side of it and had broken the wheels off of the biggest bag.  I would not fly with United again.  Qantas was great but United was well below expectation."
Oct 2019,30,Wow! the seats got bigger!?!,"Here goes: I've been flying on United since 1978, almost exclusively. Over most of that time I've been very satisfied. However, on this trip there were a number of notable observations.    First, my doctor told me that I had to lose 50 pounds, or ""else"". And when I did, he told me on my next visit that I was the only patient who ever listened to him about weight loss. So when I got on my first flight out of Boston, and all the subsequent connections to Amsterdam, I was shocked at how much bigger the seats had gotten. I asked the stewardess if they had changed the seats, and she said that they have remained the same size for a long time. So, guess that was another benefit to losing weight. As I'm also old, I've shrunk a few inches from my normal adult height, so there was actually enough leg room - which was a first for me, having lived most of my life on the tall side.    Second: I told the stewardess that I was allergic to peppers. She told me that she had no idea what was in the food. So I chose the chicken, thinking that the pasta option probably had red peppers or hot peppers in it. I took one bite of the chicken, and found that it tasted like it had been basted in peppers. I got sick. Seems there should be some better way to treat passenger allergies, especially when you tell them about it.    Third, our flight out was two hours late, so I assumed we would miss our connection as there was only a 2 1/4 hour layover in between. Fortunately, our connecting flight to amsterdam was also delayed, and we managed to get on board. There was a 115 mph tail wind, so, even thought we left a hour and a half late, we actually arrived on time. Never mind that we had to sprint over to the departure gate, which was a fair distance and put us totally out of breath.    Fourth: The flight leaving Amsterdam was also 2 hours late, which meant that we would definitely miss our flight back to Boston. We thought. We arrived in Dulles, sprinted through immigration and customs, only to find that our flight to Boston was also delayed 2 hours. So we made it. Then got the last bus out of Logan on our return to New Hampshire, arriving at around 1 in the morning. (which was 7 in the morning in Amsterdam, whose time zone we had adjusted to). This meant that we had been traveling for 23 hours straight, and were exhausted.    The good news: The bottle of scotch that I put into our checked luggage made it through unscathed. Good thing too, as it was a kind that was only available in so-called ""travel retail"", and still cost US$140 for a 700cc bottle.    What do they say: Travel is an adventure. Although we didn't have to reschedule our original flights, adding the extra two hours going and coming was a royal pain in the butt. I'm not sure if anyone else is doing better these days, but perhaps I'll try another airlines next time. So long United. (This after 41 years of loyalty)"
Oct 2019,40,So many changes and not so great!,"Obviously, all the airlines have cut the seat size and space you have in each row. Now, even the pockets barely will hold a candy bar, let alone a phone or drink. And hope you don't have someone in the middle taking up their space and yours, even after paying extra for a better seat. Flight was delayed and with the exception of having some information on my smart phone, the gate agent gave no indication of what was happening."
Oct 2019,10,Like being sardines in a can. A lot of added costs: luggage and seat assignments.,The seats keep getting smaller and the traveling experience is no longer a pleasure. It makes going somewhere overseas a chore when it used to be an adventure.
Oct 2019,40,Fly the friendly skies,"Very relaxed flight from IAH to AMS. We boarded early and the flight left early as well. All in all, we arrived 45 mins early in Amsterdam.  There was WiFi on board all the way ($).  Good cabin service - the only thing I didn’t like was the meal - I always take the chicken but for once I decided for the pasta - big mistake, way too cheesy!"
Oct 2019,40,Nice transatlantic flight,"Our Untied flight was very nice for standard economy. The seats were comfortable with average leg room and reclining. The best part was the entertainment with personal seat back screens and an incredible choice of movies and programs to watch, as well as a USB outlet to watch/listen to your own or keep your device charged. The meals were typical, but fairly tasty. The crew was pleasant and offered extra drinks/refills."
Oct 2019,20,Changed seats without warning,"Beginning of week when I started my trip I made sure our seats were together. Soon as I got the green light to check in I did so. Only to find our seats not only changed, they were no longer together. We are in seperate rows, I no longer have an isle seat, and no one would fix or give me answers as to why they couldn't fix it only that they wouldnt. Then they made me check my undersized computer bag. I'm going to be livid if my $1,400 computer is broken on arrival."
Oct 2019,50,Best Non-Stop Service in the World,"From booking the flight to deplaning in Honolulu, United Airlines offered the Best travel experience We have encountered! Agents at check in, in Newark were beyond helpful, friendly TSA staff, and Excellent agents at our gate and that was before we even boarded! The flight crew was wonderful, friendly, and well trained. Customer Service is Again Top Notch at United and Employees are Happy! We took off Early and landed Early in Honolulu! Definitely will be returning customers! Winning"
Oct 2019,40,Pleasantly Surprised,"We have not flown with United Airlines for many years but now I will look to fly with them again. We flew from Vancouver to Denver to New Orleans then flew back a week later. Of the 4 flights we flew premium economy on 3 legs. Those three flights were very very comfortable with lots of leg room and space. The 4th flight we flew regular economy and this was a big mistake and my sole reason for giving a 4 out of 5 rating instead of 5 out of 5.    The regular economy seating was uncomfortable, small, no leg room at all. I'm a short person and regular economy is normally okay for me but not on this flight. It was awful. My poor husband who is tall, had his knees jammed into the seat in front of him. We won;t make the mistake of flying regular economy again. Premium economy is not that much more money but it's sure worth it.    The flights themselves, impressive. Every flight departed and arrived early or on time. Not a single flight was delayed or late. Can't remember the last time that happened. The cabin crew were all very nice, friendly and accommodating.    We will definitely fly with United again but only in premium economy."
Oct 2019,30,Seats and leg room smaller?,"Seems like the leg room in First Class is smaller on the 737;s now and lets hear it for the sized of the bathrooms. Difficult to use and the handy capped or full size people cannot get in at all it seems. Want entertainment, better bring your iPad or phone oh yes and one that has an ear set as well as power plug in ????  Then if you want to use internet be ready to pay for that privilege as well. Drinks are served, hot nuts in thumb sized bowls, No cans of beverage and the glasses are small. Then there is first class food service--- seriously I do not think it would get any worse. On intrastate flights it is just bad. Now Polaris intercontinental that's fairly acceptable but going within the US there is no first class food. Cost of tickets for cut rate service is still the same. The staff are nice, friendly and it's not their problem. It's cheap airline service that is the issue. n fact sort of bad for one the staff as at his size I'm sure he could not use the restroom as well."
Oct 2019,10,No Value for Money,"Once again (we flew this exact same trip in March), the first class experience on United is ANYTHING BUT first class.    1) First class tickets (hugely expensive compared to any other class), will not get you into the airport lounge. First Class means nothing at the airport, in order to use the lounge you must be a member of a club and pay around $500 a year for membership.    2) First Class does not board first, frequent fliers and club members board first, no matter their class of travel.    3) The first class seats were filthy, grimy (see photos) and I had to get rid of garbage from the seat pocket and wipe crumbs off of my seat.    4) First Class was separated from the rest of the airplane by a half curtain (see photos).    5) When the flight attendants came around and asked what I wanted to drink, I asked for a glass of water, it never arrived. I asked a second time.....nothing.....when the meal came I asked again and got a glass. After the meal I asked for another glass of water, useless, no water ever arrived."
Oct 2019,50,Last Flight of the Night,"United Airlines EXCEEDED my expectations when I flew to Queretaro, Mexico for the Thanksgiving long weekend in Oct 2019.    After numerous Flight Delays, I didn't know if I was going to actually get to Queretaro or not & because I've never been to Houston before, I researched & studied the map of the Houston Airport knowing I had to transfer to a different gate & catch my connecting flight to Queretaro.    It was a welcome relief to discover that because I was on the last flight out to Queretaro & because I wasn't the only passenger that was arriving via a delayed connecting flight, United Airlines waited for me to arrive ... now that's Customer Service.    With my feet burning from running, it was a huge relief to see everyone on board & waiting for me PATIENTLY.    I will definitely fly with United Airlines again!"
Oct 2019,10,Charged for 1 pound overweight,Worst customer service ever. These employees have no clue. United obviously hasn’t implemented any new training after all the incidents they’ve had over the past few years. Our bag was 1.5lbs overweight and the agent said we had to pay $100 or take out items. So I took out a pair of shoes and our bag weighed 50.5 lbs and the agent said it’s still overweight. You can pay $100 or take more out. Absolutely pathetic. The agent was so arrogant and rude. Worst experience.
Oct 2019,10,They suck,Don't get a layover flight. The pilots are always late and they will just change your flight even though you could have made it to the one you already had and then they treat you like garbage at the new flight they give you. Its their fault you missed your flight but they don't care. Doesn't matter what your missing now. Oh and guess what? Your new flight? Yeah thats late too.
Oct 2019,30,average,"Long flights should have friendly staff but its the opposite..flight crew doesn't look like enjoying their work.. food was not good, movie selection is ok. cleanliness need to improve"
Oct 2019,40,Brisbane to Maine USA,Smooth flights. Were very helpful with baggage and holding flights for me as stopovers were extremely short. Clean and staff very good.
Oct 2019,50,Very underrated They are very good,"United were a very pleasant surprise Wrongly one tends to think of them as just another airline for Grans Atlantic flights but they more than matched the competition with service, facilities and care. All at a good price too"
Oct 2019,40,Fly me to Calgary,"This flight, leaving at 9:30 AM, was fine. Ticket handlers and flight personnel were all smiling and friendly. Seats were okay, but like all airlines I’ve flown, they could give you another inch or so of space.  Had no problems in Calgary.  All in all, a flight I would take again."
Oct 2019,50,Brilliant,"The outbound flight was very full. This did not stop the flight attendants being totally polite and professional. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Legroom in economy was reasonable. Food was excellent. Im fussy about red wine. However the wine served was amazing.In flight entertainment was outstanding. Return flight was less than half full which was an added bonus.  To the people who have given bad reviews, all I can say is either put your hands in your wallets a bit deeper and move further up front.  Well done United airlines. You knock spots off other well known airlines who wanted loads more money for the same journey 😊"
Oct 2019,20,Glad it was only 2 hours,Second disappointment in a row. What happened to 1st class? UAL should look at how most international airlines treat passengers in business class and try to do the same in 1st class.  Food - not great. Selections - not great. A pillow or cushion - not on this plane. There was a blanket - thin - not much help.  Nice cabin crew - helpful to my wife who was flying with an injury to her foot.
Oct 2019,20,So this is first class? The hot towels were good. The captain - she can make an announcement,"Not impressed by the facilities of this old 757. Drink, wine and beer selections were not impressive - seat was OK, meal was not impressive, the entertainment system did not exist except on my I pad,  This is like economy 15 years ago in a larger seat.  Not a cushion or pillow on the plane and the blanket was about twice as think as a typical bed sheet.  Cabin crew were good, nice service - friendly people.  The captain did the best job ever of making announcements - it was possible to hear and understand her. United should make her a trainer."
Oct 2019,10,Terrible service on economy - go with Delta or done other airline,Apparently with the economy ticket they do not allow you a carry on bag  They charged me $40 to check it in  This is the same carry on that I took on the Delta flight (economy ticket) from Chicago to Orlando without being charged    I will do my best to avoid United in the future and would recommend the same to all
Oct 2019,50,Polaris Class was wonderful !,"I paid the premium and flew United Polaris business class from San Francisco to Zurich nonstop in the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Before I took my seat, my vacation had begun. In San Francisco, United opened a new Polaris Lounge. The lounge is only open to passengers holding a Polaris class ticket. Everything you might ask for, and more. I recommend that you give serious effort to arriving at SFO hours early just to allow the opportunity to enjoy the lounge. The formal dining room is a twenty to thirty minute wait, but so worth it.  The flight was clockwork elegance. The comfort of the cabin, attentiveness of service, quality and amount of food and beverage exceeded expectations."
Oct 2019,30,Two Recent International Flights - Economy Plus - KNOW GOING IN,"I was in economy plus for two trips recently between CLE and PEK. The entire experience depends on if the middle seat is open on a three-across row. When it was, the flight was tolerable. When the row is full it is nearly impossible. There is no room, the seat cushions almost non existent and the food looks and tastes like slop. MAKE SURE YOU EAT BEFORE UNLESS POLARIS! It is a little better heading from Asia back to the US. I don’t think things will get better unless the gov steps in and sets some minimum standards.    I am only rating this as “average” as the flights left and departed on times. They did loose my bag once but it found within 72 hours."
Oct 2019,50,Viking Cruise on the Rhine,UA70 departed EWR on time and arrived in AMS on time. The flight was uneventful. The flight attendants were courteous and helpful. The complementary wine was a nice touch for happy hour and dinner.
Oct 2019,20,Economy = Sardines,"Even though a United flight may have a bit more amenities than say a flight with Southwest Airlines, I would much rather fly southwest. I couldn’t even enjoy the personal tv on the headrest in front of me. We were packed in so tight, way tighter than a Southwest flight, that the person next to me kept changing the channel/volume on my tv. It was to no fault of their own, we just had no where to even rest our arms. Aside, from the tight fit across the isle, the seats in front of you are also really tight. The last time I felt this crammed in a plane was when I flew one of those super cheap airlines to Vegas (horrible).    In conclusion, even though Southwest may not have all the bells and whistles that these other airlines offer, I choose comfort over features! I suggest flying Southwest."
Oct 2019,30,Nickels and dimes,"We wanted to break up our flight schedule to/rom France, and United offered the best schedule to accommodate our needs. It is disappointing that they want to charge you extra fees for limited carry-on luggage allowances. Then the food is minimal and marginally palatable, to say nothing of being nutritious. Next time we break up our flight schedule we will make arrangements on a different airline."
Oct 2019,20,Changed plane = disappointing flight,"Our return flight from Italy was a total disappointment due to United’s changing the plane used for the flight.    When purchasing our tickets, the seat selection indicated a side by side configuration for business class. And, that was what we had on the trip from the US. But, for whatever reason, the plane actually available for our return only had a single seat arrangement and no side by side seating. Consequently, with an aisle between us, and the seats themselves offset in alignment, we were flying isolated from each other.    Yes, the seats themselves were comfortable. But who needs to spend several hours in flight basically alone?"
Oct 2019,50,"On time & smooth, good flight","The main thing with any flight is smooth boarding, leaving on time & arriving on time and united met all that criteria this time."
Oct 2019,40,on time,I have never had any problems with United. They are always on time and courteous. They seem to be the least expensive as well. I will use them again.
Oct 2019,50,Very good service! Friendly staff,"It was our first time using United and we absolutely loved it! The service is very good, the staff is friendly and very accommodating. I regret not upgrading to economic plus to have a little more space, but it was still very good. Both flights arrived earlier than the scheduled time, overall we had a good experience and will definitely be traveling with them again."
Oct 2019,40,Honest Opinion,"Recently flew First Class from San Diego to Cancun via San Francisco and Houston, Return.  Check in at SD was effortless. First flight to San Francisco was a dream of a flight, Two flight attendants to cater for 20 passengers, food, drinks and snacks were provided for such a short flight. San Francisco to Houston was on a 777-200 with fully flat seats, I did not make use of the drinks or snacks on offer but I did manage to sleep all the way to Houston, Third and last flight to Cancun, again two flight attendants to cater for 20 passengers, breakfast was very good and the following service throughout the flight was first class. The exact same can be said for the return flights.  All flights departed on time and arrived ahead of time.  Great airline with very happy personnel.  My only complaint would be to ask the question why domestic first class passengers cannot use the first class lounges.    Would fly with United again for sure."
Oct 2019,10,WILL NEVER FLY AGAIN,"this was the worst customer service I’ve ever received in my entire life. I will never fly United again, I would rather pay an extra 500 bucks to fly a different airline."
Oct 2019,30,"Oh United, what has happened?","Polaris lounge at 0700 in the morning was utterly delightful, not overcrowded and with a charming and smiling front desk crew, and a great offering inside, lots of seating options and a sit down restaurant. Could not be happier with the lounge.    But goodness me, what on earth has happened to United, we were flying Polaris class back from the USA to London. Check-in and boarding was friendly and efficient and then that is where the service became inconsistent. We were lucky and had a nice pair of Flight Attendants working our aisle. I could not help but notice the opposite aisle was staffed by a man and a woman of a certain age, who for 7 hours plus could not crack a smile to anyone, not even each other. The only time I saw the last smile was as we left the aircraft in London.    I try to walk a mile in someone shoes before making a judgement, but given we had such a polite and friendly pair on our side the aircraft what on earth was so awful on the other side that the two F/As looked like they would not have p*ssed on you if you were on fire.    Really United, I used to fly United all the time and this was the first time in years. not sure I want to again.    Also the Polaris cabin felt cramped I have been in many premium cabins and was excited to try Polaris. i felt it just didn't deliver.There are better ways to get to the US. Pity."
Oct 2019,10,Completely unwilling to provide help,"My husband and I are currently on our honeymoon. We were delayed by 3 hours at JFK international airport due to wind conditions. Being the cautious traveler that I am, I tend to book additional time between flights incase there are delays like the one we experienced. UNFORTUNATELY, when traveling internationally with United Airlines, they require that you arrive one hour before the departure time of your flight if you are checking a bag. My husband and I arrived 50 minutes before our flight. We were told in the most rudely imaginable tone possible NO. 10 MINUTES TOO LATE. This resulted in a 2 day layover in SFO which we made the best of by seeing family, but the absolute refusal to help with only 10 minutes of difference given the circumstances is inexcusable for a company as large as United Airlines."
Oct 2019,10,TLD,"Ok been flying United for ever.  1k means nothing, anymore it’s just a baseline as far as they are concerned. 30 years with the airline. They don’t care.  Don’t count on star alliance lounge anymore.  Don’t could on even trying for any possible upgrade.  Gotta pay a big co pay along with miles.  Italy airport it you are not flying Business class then you CAN NOT use  The star alliance room anymore!  Looking for a new airline!"
Oct 2019,40,on-time flight with great flight attendants,"Most importantly, the flight departed Chicago on time and arrived SFO earlier than the ETA.    The flight attendants were super friendly and attentive with great smiles, making you feel the trip is awesome.    I am not a big fan of the new menu featuring fresh items at UA. Only 4 choices."
Oct 2019,30,A Really Uncomfortable Flight,"I thought the addition of a direct flight from Chicago to Redmond would be a terrific benefit and a big improvement over a connection in Portland or elsewhere. Unfortunately, I can't say that's the reality. The plane they use is smaller (not sure exactly what type of plane but 4 seats across), the seats are incredibly stiff and uncomfortable, limited meal/snack service, and no power ports. This was one of the most long and uncomfortable flights I can recall in quite a while. I'm used to flying the Bombardiers out of Redmond, but only to Portland or maybe as far as L.A., but flying on such an uncomfortable plane all the way from Chicago is pretty rough. I think each person needs to weigh the benefit of the direct flight over a connecting flight that allows you to stretch in between flights. That said, the crew were very good and had to deal with a medical emergency just before landing. They were professional and very efficient in dealing with the delay in deplaning."
Oct 2019,30,"Airline is ok, service not what it used to be.","Airline has lost its service culture, they changed my schedule from SJU TO YYC to an absolute ridiculous tour of the USA, what on earth!!!. I must admit on the return flight the staff in YYC was very helpfull and made better arrangements for me. I have used this airline since Continental and it is just not the same anymore."
Oct 2019,40,THE FLIGHT AND ON TIME,great right on time taking off from vegas smooth flight not too much leg room but we got to destination save and early than schedule
Oct 2019,20,Flight Took off early w/o me,"My United flight landed at the Newark airport three minutes before my connecting United flight was boarding. I made to the terminal to be told that my flight was allowed to depart early. The United counter clerk had an attitude and couldn’t understand or didn’t care that I was upset by this decision. I will never book with United Airlines again. Their customer service is awful, I have had better experience with their competitors."
Oct 2019,10,Family visit,"On the way to Houston I sat in a window seat on the right side of the plane, which I had to pay extra. On the way back I sat at a window seat on the left side of the plane. I did not get up until arrival on both legs of the trip. Mostly because it is too much of a struggle to get in and out of the seats. The air system was not blowing at all on the Houston to Boston trip at my seat. The seats are so uncomfortable I don""t know why I had to pay extra. I""m sure that United is not the only airline that has no problem squeezing extra seats on the airplane with total disregard for the comfort of their customers. I was entertained by the announcement as we taxied to the gate... ""Please remain COMFORTABLY"" seated until the seat belt light....."
Oct 2019,50,Great trip to Germany,"The trip was long ( 8 hours 15 minutes ) pleasurable and enjoyable . With the warm professional service of the stewardess , the trip seemed shorter than it actually was ."
Oct 2019,10,Canceled Flight,"I would ideally never fly on a United flight again. We were tying our shoes, preparing to get picked up to be driven to the airport by a friend on Friday around noon, when we got causal text messages that our flight was cancelled (no explanation) and not to worry, they would fly us out the next day.    We were originally supposed to fly into Rochester, NY for a wedding (taking place on Friday evening). We quickly called United but they took their time finding a ""solution"", time we didn't have. After a very prolonged conversation with United, we were able to get rescheduled onto a flight into Ithaca, NY, in order to not miss a family wedding that we had planned to attend for months.    As a result of the cancellation and flying into Ithaca, we were forced to rent a vehicle and drive from Ithaca to Rochester, NY, in order to make it on-time. Additionally, due to the delay by the United customer support to reschedule us onto the flight into Ithaca, we had to resort to bring our car to Dulles and paying for long-term parking.    While on the phone with United to reschedule our call, they assured us that they would reimburse our parking and rental car costs. I am always hesitant to take the word of customer service employees because they aren't the ones that ultimately help you at the end of the process (thus they have no skin in the game) but I trusted United on this one, which was my mistake.    Upon turning in our receipts, they gave us $150 vouchers to fly on United AGAIN. Vouchers, to use the same service that continually didn't deliver the first time, is not the same as reimbursement. Those vouchers do not help me pay the parking and rental car bills and they are not what I was promised.    I fly constantly for work and based on this experience, which should have been a simple hour-long flight, I will be avoiding United at all costs."
Oct 2019,40,Easy and Pleasant,"If you are willing to speak up about an issue you will more than likely receive a solution.  Do not be a complainer, be a complimenter and calmly and briefly describe your issue."
Oct 2019,40,Good International Trip,"My wife and I returned from visiting a couple of European countries on United 47 from FRA to IAH. Check-in was smooth and the flight, while long, was enjoyable. The food service was very good and the flight attendants were friendly and helpful. I like flying United and the other Star Alliance members."
Oct 2019,40,"On time, great check-in and updates, great price","My check-in and customer experience is always great with United. This flight was on-time, pleasant and the meals were actually good :). That being said, some of the older flight attendants definitely get grumpy quickly and create a less welcoming environment. Overall a great flight at a great price."
Oct 2019,30,Looking a bit tired,"Compared to the other flights we've made in the past few weeks, this one was staffed by tired looking flight staff - there were few smiles or signs that they were enjoying their roles. It probably didn't help that every single seat was filled and we were asked to checkin handluggage (not too many people took up that offer). The plane looked tired and frumpy. I guess it's to be expected when you consider the huge number of passengers United shifts each year. Thankfully we sat at the back of a galley so had heaps of leg room. Seats are your bog-standard economy width - had a large passenger sitting next to me, who spilled over onto my seat, was squished for the entire 11 hour flight with no where to go. Food was ok. Impressed with how staff kept the toilets clean and nice smelling; they were used almost constantly for the entire flight."
Oct 2019,10,There is no viable Customer Service at UA,"On 10/5/19, I flew South Bend, IN to Chicago, to get a connecting flight to Newark. Flight 3847 had a mechanical issue and was late arriving SBN, and more than 2 hours late into ORD (only a 20 minute flight), so I missed my 7:20 PM connecting flight to EWR, the last flight of the day. I was using ""Miles"" to fly and that caused me to be discriminated against in my attempt to get back to EWR, despite being a Million Miler Flyer (a result of being a loyal CO/UA customer for 35 years). having a Gold Card for life, and being 70 years old (hence not looking like a typical young revenue passenger). I was denied a hotel room at ORD, made to fly to Dulles on a flight arriving just after 12 AM, and made to sleep at a gate in another terminal for a 6 AM flight to EWR. I have tried to contact UA Customer Service several times to complain, but have been ignored, given 5000 miles to be quite, and refused the number of a CS Supervisor to discuss my treatment. I told them to take the 5K miles back; they couldn't even do that right. I fly first class, round trip to Europe several times a year as a revenue passenger, but that doesn't qualify me to speak to UA CS. I hate this airline since they took Continental in a merger because all the professional service is gone. Fly a European Airline if you want to be treated like a human being. I will only fly UA if I have no other option and will hold my nose while doing so!"
Oct 2019,30,Felt cramped with legroom,"The flight was fairly uneventful. But I have long legs, and it was very cramped, since I was in a middle seat."
Oct 2019,40,A great flight,A great United flight for a change. Service was great. Food still sucks but servciec was great! Flew to Haneda airport for Tokyo.
Oct 2019,50,flight,flight was packed as usual . pilot and flight attendants could not have done more to make my two grandchildren welcome. had one same attendant on return flight and she again was over the top
Oct 2019,40,"""Good Service but an older aircraft""",The flight was delayed for about 2 hours even before getting to the airport and that process needs to better improve. Otherwise the flight was ok. Flight date was 10/14/2019. Bog to IAH 12:14am
Oct 2019,40,Good economy,"Economy class is OK, and the aircraft was relatively new. The flight between Vegas and San Francisco is short but the seating was comfortable."
Oct 2019,50,Lemons Into Lemonade,"Due to mechanical difficulties, our flight from Guatemala City to STL via Houston was delayed over 5 hours. Now, I am thankful anytime a carrier chooses to take care of a mechanical problem before leaving the ground! The flight made it impossible to make our connecting flight in Houston to St Louis so we got to spend the night in Texas! The airline could not have handled it better. They provided a light meal at the gate, gave each of our party $30 in travel vouchers for food and put us up at a very nice Holiday Inn Express. I am so happy we did not have to camp out in the airport. The employees were so helpful and we were well taken care of in a bad situation. They followed up by giving each of us a $50 evoucher to be used in the next year for another flight."
Oct 2019,40,Basic but did the job,Did seven flights in all over three weeks recently. The International flights did the job but meals basic seat leg room thought a bit small. They came round with beverages regularly. The five internal flights were again OK but any food had to be paid for and didn't look that appealing. One of our flights was delayed but give them their due did everything they could to help us catch our connection. Would use them again but not one of my favourite airlines.
Oct 2019,40,Good First Class,"This was a good 4 hour flight. I’m not sure that the small aircraft seats are that comfortable and think that for the price, United should upgrade their seating."
Oct 2019,40,"Service quite good, aircraft on the older side","Economy plus class is quite ok. I had an emergency seat, so the space was good. The difference either airlines was that there was no footrest, which helps when you try to sleep. Entertainment program had some new titles, so comparable to other major airlines. One thing while booking was that no Economy Plus/Premium was shown online. So, I could book this class only at check-in. Food was average, service was good."
Oct 2019,20,united airlines,this is horrible service. my flight is delayed 7 hours for something they can’t fix. every 2 hours they will say it is delayed another 2 hours. it is now 3 in the morning and i was suppose to be gone at 9 at night. i’m never flying with them again
Oct 2019,30,"The Friendly skies, not so friendly","I have flown dozens of flights on United over the years. This flight was typical -- there is a crowd of passengers trying to get to their seats with little assistance from the flight attendents. The flight crew must have forgotten that they are working for ""the friendly skies."""
Oct 2019,20,Honolulu to Saigon via NRT,"Ok so this is going to be a mixed review. Booked HNL to SGN for two people. When we looked at our seat assignments booked on the same record locator, we were not sitting together. When I went to look our only choice was to upgrade. We upgraded to economy plus and when we got on board it was actually premium economy (hence why the $140+ plus upgrade per seat). The eats were great with pull out leg things and special headsets and overhead bin specific to premium economy. However flight was delayed due to crew issue. It would have been nice to get more info; even the flight attendants seemed annoyed. Flight left about 2 hours late after the ""crew problem"" was rectified. We got a granola bar for our troubles. On the return, seats were the same problem, wife and I were separate again. Since we were satisfied with the upgraded going out. I decided to pay again so my wife and I could sit together. Seats were about $120 and $110 each for the upgrade. But a total bait and switch from United. In Narita I decided to ask UA customer service if it was premium economy again and she said they don't have that service NRT to HNL due to plane and only that service on the outbound. What a joke! When we got on the plane the seats were a bit bigger/leg room etc but not like the seats we had on the outbound. Total scam. Even the TV screen was smaller and the touchscreen was terrible and the type where you feel like someone is tapping your head from behind. Feel super taken by United. Food just meh on both legs; jenky bathroom equipment on the return flight. You would think if you upgrade especially at over $100 a seat you get priority boarding or better food, etc. Total scam"
Oct 2019,40,flight to Rome,Flights were on time. Flight attendants made as comfortable as possible. We were served dinner which was pretty decent for airline meals.
Oct 2019,40,Easy flight,"Went to London two weeks ago, traveling on United Airline! Was able to choose my seat which gave me plenty of room on the aisle. If it wasn’t for the guy getting up almost every 40 minute, the flight would have been better! I like this airline because it doesn’t charge you for everything and it’s very comfortable."
Oct 2019,20,Cabo Trip,"The plane was an older plane, where they offered DirectTV, but the channels get getting disrupted. The seats were not that much more space than economy and they actually ran out of the selection of snacks and then was offering just pretzels. The seats didn't have any USB connections and were not that comfortable at all. Personally, it was a waste of money to upgrade."
Oct 2019,40,Not a good experience!!,"I changed my airlines preference hoping it will be much better compared to American Airlines....Sure enough.... I was wrong.I have always flew with American Airlines and I have never experienced any type of delays like this!! United Airlines created a mess....they keep texting...delays after delays not to mention they keep changing the times 3:15....4:15...5:30.....4:45....5:30....4:05....5:15....5:20...4:05......6:30...It was a mess...everyone was freaking out...not knowing where to go, etc."
Oct 2019,40,"Good flight, using points","Nice two leg flight from Raleigh/Durham (RDU) to Toronto (YYZ), with a change of planes in Newark (EWR). Good 53-minute connection, which was easy to make. United's lounge has a newly renovated salad bar, light refreshments and bar service.. located near security."
Oct 2019,40,Not like it used to be,"Had to take United Airlines to O’Hare for a meeting at an airport hotel.  There was a time United had the A1 gate at BWI and a club. They were pushed out when Southwest Airlines took over first pier A and now A&B!  United is relegated to a few gates st the end of D and no more club at all.  On this trip passengers had to go all the way to the international terminal (E) to go through TSA and then hike all the way back to the end of D quite a hike.  On the return trip, at O’Hare, and although I had TSA Pre-Check and Premier Access I, and others I might add, was herded to an interminable line with all the security tasks. Shoes, computer out of bag, belt off, etc. Not a TSA call, a United employee call.  Made up for it though with a nice “old fashioned” during the flight. Oh yes on the way over there was no old fashion mix for the bourbon. You’ve come a long way DOWN United from the days of Gershwin and “Fly the Friendly Skies”!"
Oct 2019,30,Polaris Not Worth the Price,"On our recent round trip to Paris from Newark, we did not find the $4500 per ticket price a good value. The seat configuration was just OK and attempting to lie down on the flat seats was akin to squeezing in a too small coffin without the lid.  Service on our outbound flight was poor which contrasted sharply with the very attentive service on the Paris to Newark flight. Food was just airline food. The interactive seat back entertainment service functioned well.  It should be noted that the special Polaris lounge in Newark was superior and much less crowded than the general, United lounge. No Polaris lounge exists at Charles De Gaulle."
Oct 2019,20,First flew with United 30 years ago and nothing has changed.,"Despite paying for a Business class airfare from Washington to Los Angeles to connect with our International flight on AirNZ (Star Alliance member), we were unable to use the Washington lounge, or Club Lounge, as we do when frequently flying other partnership airlines on Star Alliance and OneWorld. It was pointed out in the LAX Star Alliance Lounge that we had been ticketed as Economy, despite checking in at the deserted First Class counter in Washington. The woman said that if she didn't deal with United airlines complaints she would have nothing to do. The female crew were scruffy and unkempt and the food horrid, except for the frozen strawberry ice cream. The seats were excellent but the screen was too small and neither of us could hear, even with the sound turned up. The movies were ghastly American rubbish so it really didn't matter as my book was much more entertaining."
Oct 2019,20,Not As Bad As Frontier?,"Four flights, round trip. Through Houston each way. Three flights on 737s. The most uncomfortably crowded aircraft in the world. The seats were too narrow and too close together. No padding in the seat. Although the seats were supposed to recline, all that does is make things worse. They've cut the size of the trays in half because there is no longer room for a full sized tray.    The controls for the seatback audio/video were on top of the tiny armrest and you cannot put your arm down without changing the brightness, volume or something else.    All airlines seem focused on cramming people into smaller and smaller spaces. I used to enjoy flying. NO more.    A horribly uncomfortable experience."
Oct 2019,40,Very Good Flight,"Flight was on time both in route and return trips. Despite snowy weather on arrival at Denver International, the flight to Durango was only delayed about 30 minutes till the heavy snow stopped. The return flights to Louisville were comfortable and arrived ahead of schedule but had to wait approximately 20 minutes till the ground crew finally guided the aircraft to a parking gate. Luggage was also delayed at the carousel and signs at the baggage area did not indicate the location. Smaller aircraft are used for these flights with restricted legroom. Space is small for carry-on bags in the overhead compartments. There is room under seats for a backpack as long as it is not over-packed."
Oct 2019,50,American Airlines - Great Airline,"I had a great flight going to DC - it was a full flight and I was hoping I could get upgraded to 1st Class - nope. It's ok, It was really enjoyable and the attendants were super. The trip back to Nashville 3 days later was crazy - the flight was over booked and then about 15 of us had to check our carry-on's at the last minute. The attendants were rude and seemed like they were rushing to hurry up and get done. Overall, it was a good experience. I'm giving 5 stars because the attendants on my 1st flight were so great!!"
Oct 2019,50,AWESOME in-flight amenities!,"VERY affordable flight! Beverages and snacks provided graciously (at no additional cost), at least 3 times during the 2.5 hr flight! BETTER SERVICE THAN FRONTEIR!"
Oct 2019,40,Relatively painless,Flight to Chicago lay over was okay. Seats not too bad. Flight from Chicago to Paris was much the same. Was able to watch a movie or two. Flight attendants were great!
Oct 2019,40,Good flight but had delay,"Good flight but long delay in Newark--plane was sitting there but the crew had not arrived. Good news is that they made up some of the time on the way to Montreal. Also, we had good leg room as we had the seats in the emergency exit aisle."
Oct 2019,40,Love the overnight Kona to Denver Flight,I have flown this route many times and the flight is always on time with great service. Enjoy having the flat bed on an overnight flight. The layover is just long enough to grab a quick breakfast at the United Club. My only suggestion is that the dinner choices need to be updated as they have been the same for what seems like years.
Oct 2019,10,United Hotels program a farce,"We fly UA often but on Lufthansa since it's the international carrier. I book through UA which has been fine, no issues. My issues is with UA's partnership with HOtels.com. After booking some flights the United Hotels offerings came up so decided to try again...(had one other unproductive try earlier in the year). The lodging I booked offered 1,750 MileagePlus awards, but when I entered my number it was rejected because the system kept inserting periods after letters and numbers. Support told me the system had issues all day and to call back and they would attach my awards account. NO ONE at the Hotels.com or UA MileagePlus knew anything about anything. Call here, call there. Worse, UA doesn't mention or address this partnership anywhere on the website.Total ruse. Buyer beware..."
Oct 2019,40,Good to be Back home,"The flight over to Lisbon was great, small layover in DC. The flight from DC to lisbon was excellent, great service! If possible try and get a direct flight, personally I am not a fan of layovers, but overall great trip!"
Oct 2019,40,Uncomfortable,Flew from Manchester to New York flight good adequate leg room. Then flew new York to Washington flight good. Last flight Dulles to Dublin smaller plane leg room minimal. Throughout all flights flight attendants helpful and friendly. Security staff at Dulles airport not very helpful. I am slightly disabled and walk with a stick. I was asked to remove my trainers. When I asked was there a chair I was told no. There was a chair the other side of X-ray machine. A friend needed to untie laces because stick had already gone through. No consistency people on other belts let through with shoes on.
Oct 2019,50,Grand Junction to Denver,"This flight was a good experience.  I arrived at the airport early and decided to check if there was room on an earlier flight. The agent checked, but didnt find any. As I was going through security, the agent from the check in counter found me and told me I was moved up to the earlier flight. Finding me was easy in this small airport.  I arrived at the gate and found that the plane was larger than expected, which made carrying bags on much easier.  The flight departed on time and was a very pleasant experience."
Oct 2019,40,We got where we were going safely and with our luggage,"We flew on United from Boise to Boston. The crew and attendants were efficient and friendly. We were delayed leaving Chicago because of bad weather in Boston, but that is not the airline's fault. Flying is not like it used to be on any airline, so the seats were small, the food service was a snack and beverage. They have added a strupfwaffel to their choices. We had a late boarding group so they checked my carry on, on the way back for free. Suitcases currently cost $30 each way. On the return flight we were delayed by our plane not getting into Denver and had to wait more than an hour extra for our connection.I do like having a seat assignment."
Oct 2019,40,Smooth,"Overall a stress free journey, two points, one being minor:  1. Unable to check in online via the app or with the automated service at the airport due to being Canadian PR instead of Citizen, had to seek assistance from a staff member who helped out.  2. Hot water was tepid and no milk on the flight to be offered with a cup of tea, only creamer which is abhorrent."
Oct 2019,10,Poorest airport service I have ever experienced,"Recently, my wife and I had a very poor experience while departing Hilton Head. I had purchased two First-Class round-trip tickets from IAD to HHH. On this clear morning on May 20, 2019, on our return flight, our aircraft (UA 6129) was schedule to depart HHH at 9:30AM on flight First Class direct to Washington Dulles arriving at 11:09AM. At 7:01AM, we received notice that UA 6139 was delayed and would depart HHH around 10:22AM and arriving at IAD at 12:01PM.    I checked via the UAL mobile application on my iPhone at our hotel just after reviewing that notice. We then departed to the airport to ensure that my wife and I arrived at least an hour prior to new boarding time so that we could check our two bags and my golf bag. I had checked the UAL policy beforehand and was aware that we need to be at the airport at least 45 minutes before departure.    When we arrived, I observed outraged families speaking with a Mesa supervisor who had denied their boarding. This was the same flight as my wife and I were on. We entered the Premier line (which did not seem to make any difference to Mesa as everyone was using it so there was a wait time) and the same supervisor (Christine) told us we were not allowed to check our bags because we did not meet the minimum of one and a half hour arrival prior to the flight’s departure. I attempted to have a discussion with the Supervisor and she would have nothing to do with engaging and simply walk away. As one might imagine, I was flabbergasted and many other passengers were extremely frustrated.    I mentioned to a Customer Service Agent (CSR) that my wife and I has already checked in and had our boarding passes. At that point, for some reason, the CSR told my wife that she would be allowed to board but refused to process our bags because of the direction she had received from Christine. A nearby Mesa Team Lead then instructed the CSR to book me on a later flight and let me take all the bags and allow my wife to depart now on the schedule flight with no bags. As that seemed like the only solution at this point, since they told us that they couldn’t get both of us on the afternoon flight, I agreed and was booked without my wife who now boarded with a vacant seat next to her. As I now had my wife’s suitcase in my possession, I was charged for the “extra” bag. So, for $150, I was able to bring my extra bag with me. I asked about running the bags through the TSA baggage screening, and was informed by the Mesa lead (it was marked on the back of her safety vest), that they would not accept that bags until at least four hours prior the flight. Wonderful. So, I look my bags and sat in the airport for another 30 minutes and then passed the bags through the TSA baggage screening.    I would request corrective action be taken with your regional carrier, Mesa Airlines (d.b.a United Express) operating out of Hilton Head Airport. Specifically, I request retraining the Supervisor and Team Lead on the proper passenger handling procedures when checking them in and getting them onboard the aircraft. Currently, my observation was the supervisor at that location, who operates a what appeared to be a very well running team on the ramp, applies the same methodologies to handling passengers, more like cargo    As a side note, while I was sitting waiting past the TSA Checkpoint, a frantic mother who was attempting to get on a flight was boarding caught my attention because of the elevated level of noise. She appeared to be the last person to board a waiting flight. The same Mesa supervisor had just closed the door to the ramp. The door to the aircraft had not closed yet. What caught my attention was this woman screaming that it was not her fault that she was late to the gate and her family was onboard with her items and everyone vacation would be ruined. The woman departed the gate area only to return that the Mesa same supervisor then let her board the aircraft. It would have seemed much easier to let her board the first time, in my humble opinion, and not have every passenger witness that exchange."
Oct 2019,50,United airlines long haul flight to LAX,"I had not heard on United airline’s before our holiday to California.  We booked with Tui.  I booked our seats on the plane well in advance on the united airlines app, it was easy and straight forward to do.  We flew economy which was comfortable.  Whilst on the flight we were offered a complimentary drink just after take off which was a choice of hot beverages, soft drinks and a selection of beers and wine.  Shortly after we were offers a snack and a bottle of water.  Following that we had our first hot meal of the flight.  I pre booked the vegetarian option on the app, which was vegetable Thai green curry with a roll and fruit and another bottle of water.  It was delicious. Throughout the flight we were offers drinks  The next hot meal was a breakfast roll with cheese, snacks and fruit and a vegan cookie  The seats are comfortable and included a pillow and blanket.  The on flight entertainment was very good with a large selection of films and shows to choose from.  All the staff are very helpful and approachable.  I thoroughly enjoyed my flight and would highly recommend using this airline.  I will definitely be booking again with them on my next long haul flight."
Oct 2019,20,Going on a cruise,"No choice in airlines, the trip was a group cruise arranged by others. I quickly remembered why I don’t choose United Airlines when booking my own travel. Lines were long. Airport agents made mistakes. Seats on the airplane were tight and uncomfortable. Not a good experience."
Oct 2019,50,Red Eye Flight,"Flight(s) on time both in Phoenix and Washington D.C.. Only a two hour layover at Dulles. Baggage was waiting when I got to New York. For the money, this was one of best flights I have booked. Would definitely use this flight again."
Oct 2019,40,Friendly Skies with United,"Founded in 1926 as Varney Air Lines, United has since gone on to be recognized as the third largest airline in the world, as measured in terms of fleet size and route network. Despite its longevity in the world of aviation, it hasn’t been all roses and sunshine for United. In the last few years, this airline has had a rough time with regard to its public image and customer satisfaction. My own experience, on the other hand, has been positive. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that I don’t fly United very often (this was my first flight with them in 7 years) but, be that as it may, I’ve never had an issue.    My recent flight from SFO to DFW is a case in point. While SFO was hectic as always, the boarding experience at the Gate went off without a hitch. I was “upgraded” to “Economy Plus” for whatever reason (hey, I won’t argue) and so was able to board a little bit earlier than if I’d been stuck in cattle class. Because I was seated in one of the first rows of “Economy Plus” seating, it didn’t take long for me to sit. One of the benefits to being relatively close to the front of the aircraft is you don’t have to stand a needlessly long time while the lemmings in front of you try to cram as much baggage as possible into the overhead bins (yay!). My seat, while the standard width (17.7”), did have a bit more leg room than your typical “Economy” seat (34” vs. 30”), which was nice and made for an overall comfortable flight.    The flight crew was very friendly, but seemed kind of amateur-ish when it came to reading the safety demonstration protocol. The lead flight attended just read verbatim off a sheet; you’d think they’d have it memorized by now . . . unless they’re new? Anyway, that little gripe notwithstanding, I found the crew to be most pleasing. The pilots were especially informative and genuinely sounded like they were enjoying their job.    I’ve flown on United a whopping five times over the last 7 years, including their “Shuttle” subsidiary. Some flights were better than others for various reasons but, on the whole, I’d rate United as a “very good” air carrier. They’re definitely not, as Wired would suggest, the “industry leader in the abandonment of basic decency.” That title, I think, is best reserved for Air Canada. United’s on-time performance has been good and their pricing for domestic travel has always been attractive."
Oct 2019,40,Flight in Economy ok but First Class Excellent,"Flight from Houston was delayed to weather but no one announced it EVER. When you ask staff at boarding gate they said""We will notify you when we are boarding""! Also experienced first time in a very long time having to walk OUTSIDE to board plane. Never would have believed this of a big airport like Houston. Flight to DC was without incident. Flight back home we booked First Class. It was EXCELLENT!"
Oct 2019,20,Quite the experience,"Our family began our European Vacation on flight 1564 from Boston to London with a connection in Chicago on flight 931. Arriving at Logan hours ahead of schedule, we had already received 3 texts from United about flight delays. The next text was a cancellation due to storms in Chicago, causing panic as we hurried to the service desk. They were able to get us on the next flight leaving shortly, luckily. We were given evil looks by one flight attendant as we switched seats to make sure our young daughter sat with us. On the connecting flight 931 from Chicago to London, there were 5 more delays due to a lack of crew members and excessive traffic on the tarmac. This caused our 6:30 PM flight to not actually depart till 10:00 PM. Dinner was promptly served at 10:15 PM. Once on the flight there were no issues and we reclined comfortably. We arrived in London just about 3 hours behind schedule. Seems that United has some real scheduling problems and is unable to get flights departing on time."
Oct 2019,50,Economy is Economy is Economy,"No complaints. Long flight, cramped seats, good movie section, tolerable food, acceptably clean cabin & bathrooms, pleasant staff."
Oct 2019,10,My last UA flight.,"Our departure was scheduled for 11:15.  There were 3 check-in stations available, with 2 agents working.  The lines were long.  As we got to approximately half way to the counter, one of the agents left her station.  When we were next to last in line and the couple behind us was scheduled to depart in fifteen minutes, so we allowed them to go ahead of us.  When they got their boarding passes the remaining agent left her station and told us she had to work the gate and would return in about an hour.  Our flight was scheduled to depart in about an hour.  In about forty five minutes another agent opened the counter.  When we checked-in we told our flight was cancelled and we were put on another flight departing at 1:15.  (my personal opinion, based on speaking with other passengers in line was that UA had combined 2 under booked flights). She assured us we would make our connecting flight in Newark to Orlando with no problem.  The 1:15 flight left the gate on time but did not actually take-off until around 2.  When we did land in Newark, we immediately went through immigration, went directly to baggage claim, waited for our bags, cleared customs and went directly to re-check our bags.  We were told we would not make our flight and we needed to go to customer service.  At customer service Emerol was able to get us on a 7:00 flight to Orlando but not in first class.  We accepted the flight.  Due to weather, the flight was delayed until 8:00.  Just before boarding, we were given our first class seats.  By the time we got home, it was after mid-night. I believe if our original flight was not canceled we would have made our connection and been home on time. All-in-all, I was very disappointed in United Airlines service in Quebec City."
Oct 2019,20,AVOID FLYING INTO CHICAGO OHARE FROM INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS UNLESS YOU HAVE 3 HOURS FOR LAYOVER,"Flight to Frankfurt was great and no issues. Crew did a fine job.  However, The return flight from Rome international to Chicago Ohare was horrible from a standpoint of the service we received from the airline. On board we were given declaration forms to fill out regarding any foods, or perishable items that we needed to declare before we arrived in the US. The flight attendant did not give me one so I asked her for a copy. She told me that I don't need to worry about it and I did not need to fill one out. I thought that was very odd.  We had allowed for a 1.5 hour layover time in Chicago between our arrival time into Ohare and then our departure flight back to our home in the Midwest. The runway was so torn up at Ohare that it really looked like the entire perimeter and interior of the runways had been boomed from above. Pills of dirt and concrete everywhere. Once we landed we had to taxi for 22 minutes before we even arrived at out gate. After that, then you wait for the plane to off load. We were then told that due to the massive re-construction of the airport and it facilities that we would have to take a city bus from the airport terminal back to the check in gates for the airline. This is after you collect your luggage and then have to go through customs again, which is normal. The only problem is, they had one TSA agent working the counter for the declaration booth. There must have been 400 people standing in line from a all direction waiting for that one man to let them back in so that we could drop off our luggage again for the next leg of the flight. Dropping off the luggage was a joke and poorly handled to say the least. We were told to just leave them by a single attendant and she would make sure they got on the right flight. Guess what!, out of the two pieces of luggage, we only made it back home with one. I have no idea how that happened considering the 2nd piece was sitting right next to the one piece of luggage that did make it. OK, now were all taken out of the security loop and put into a city bus for a 10 minute drive to Uniteds' main check-in gates to go back through the entire check in and again go back thought security. By this time we are only 3 minutes from our flight closing the doors to the aircraft. We had to cover the entire length of the terminal wing running just to make it on time. I arrived first and told the attendant that my wife was just behind me. He told me that he is closing the door now and we would have to book on another flight. I explained to him that the reason we were not on board already was due to the airports and the airlines mishandling of the whole procedure. He told me that was not his concern. Bye the way, He was trying to close the door 1 minute before the monitor said it would close. the other attendant told him to stop closing the door and to wait for my wife, who arrived 1 minute behind me. The first attendant was not happy at all that he was over-ridden and told to wait until my wife arrived. We did not make them hold the plane any longer than what was posted so no one on board was delayed or inconvenienced. As it was, when we got on board, there were several others who were heading to the same town we were that did not make it on board in time. The next flight was at 9:30 Pm and that was several hours away.  OK, Long story but I have a purpose behind it.    1). DO NOT FLY INTO CHICAGO OHARE AIRPORT FROM AN INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT IF IT IS NOT THE LAST LEG OF YOUR FLIGHT!!!    2). UNITED NEEDS TO TRAIN SOME OF THEIR STAFF BETTER AND TO TEACH THEM HOW TO HAVE A BIT MORE EMPATHY FOR ITS SO CALLED VALUED GUESTS."
Oct 2019,20,Poor Flight from San Antonio to Tuscan AZ,My flight was delayed for 1 hr and 40 minutes from San Antonio to Tucson not a great flight. The leg from Houston to Tucson was not that great. The crew was not that friendly and it took 30 minutes to get my bags when we landed.
Oct 2019,10,waste of time,"Yesterday's fight was so typical United... as Management is SO FULL OF THEMSELVES:  1. WiFi didn't work properly...ever  2. legroom is totally cramped; canned sardines have more freedom of movement  3.the good news was- we landed 25 minutes early; the bad news was- we sat there for 25 minutes 'waiting for the gate to be available.' The Pilot said he 'called 4 times for assistance, but to no action"". I suspect they also have radios and, while in flight, SOMEONE knew the plane was expected early. Or is the Ground Crew SURPRISED when a plane shows up?!?!?  4. I received the obligatory survey email... and it didn't work at all... or maybe they ONLY ACCEPT SATISFIED surveys.. probably don't get many of them...  Best advice to united: get better or go away"
Oct 2019,40,Good service,"We flew non-stop for 10.30 hours. Seats were very comfortable, service was good. We flew a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, 3-3-3 configuration. Entertainment was good, plenty of movies/tv-series and documentaries to chose from. Cabin crew was very friendly and helpful. Entertainment system had the Do Not Disturb option. And a Wake me for diner. Very handy!"
Oct 2019,40,Good Direct Flight From Washington DC,On time departure and slightly early arrival. Pay for the additional leg room....seat back screens are too small. Service was fine...I rarely eat airplane food so can’t comment on that..overall would recommend United to international flights
Oct 2019,40,Dulles to Boston Logan without a hitch!,"I had a wonderful flight from Dulles to Boston Logan and return flight a few days later without any hitches. The flight was smooth, service was good and my bags made it both ways without any issues. Both flights were on time leaving and both arrived earlier than expected. All in all a better travel experience than I usually have on any airline."
Oct 2019,40,FLIGHT CREW WAS VERY ATTENTIVE,"The flight crew was very attentive. We were an hour and thirty minutes late leaving the gate because the airport would not allow the plane to pull away. I missed my connecting flight in Newark and United went out of there way to help me get home to Houston asap. Flights were full everywhere because of the ASTROS and Yankees game that night but they routed me through Atlanta and then to Houston!! Thank you, United!!!"
Oct 2019,50,AMAZING SERVICE ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👏👏👏👏,Thé 5 stars is for Claude Aline only who is such an excellent asset for your company.  We never found on United Airlines an employe so gracious and so professional like  Claude Aline.    You definitely need to improve the food on Polaris .. we are always very disappointed by the taste and the quality of the food....    Hope to travel again with Claude Aline ..!!
Oct 2019,10,Delayed baggage,"I flew from Florence to Houston with two stops (Frankfurt and Philadelphia) last Sunday.  All the three flights where late but I managed to make it.  My bag didn't arrived. It was left in Philadelphia.  On Monday after several calls to the Baggage Resolution Center I've found out around 6:00pm that the bag was finally on his way to Houston. I've received a text this morning saying that the delivery was schedule by 7:00am.  At 12:00pm, still waiting for the delivery, I've called the Baggage Center again and learned that the bag was probably going to be delivery within the next 2 or 3 hours.  Unbelievable!!! I'm very disappointed.  There is no attention to customer's needs and a total lack of communication.  Very stressful!"
Oct 2019,50,Dulles to Dublin - GREAT!,Great flight from Dulles to Dublin. Economy Plus seats were great. Flight crew was friendly and attentive. Meals were pleasant. No major issues during the flight. Minor issue with the in-flight entertainment system; it rebooted shortly after take off and took forever (over an hour) to work its way back online to each screen. Landed on time. Customs in Dublin was easy. Luggage was quick to appear.
Oct 2019,10,Actual worst airline ever,"Horrible customer service, no help at all with flight changes and cancellations, HUGE change fees for reservations. Don't care about their clients in any way and only care about money. Worst experience with an airline I have ever had."
Oct 2019,10,"The flight was decent however the seats, windows were dirty. The service was below average.","I purchased my initial ticket which I cancelled within the 24 hour time frame! I was told I'd receive my money with in 2 weeks or so by a fellow rep there. However I was declined my refund & was told I didn't call and request a refund. I also was told Id have a ""credit"" with them that I have to use with in a YEAR. I was robbed ! After purchasing a second ticket with them thinking I was in good hands ! I cant believe these people really have the heart to rob someone off their money. The manager there stated she would not go back & pull the call. She stated there will not be a refund point blank clear, even after I was TOLD I'd receive my money in cash. For those that need to cancel a flight please take record of the name , the time you called & also submit a refund ticket online for your records. They are a scam when it comes down to OUR refunds!"
Oct 2019,10,Celebrating Engagement,"United is awful. We ended up getting seats separate from one another despite buying them together. What kind of crap is that? We are flying internationally and have to sit with strangers for our 4 hour flight. We now refuse to fly united, ever again and will ensure our large network of family and friends follow suit."
Oct 2019,50,Zurich to Dulles,"Really nice plane, 787-8. Configuration was good with enough room for a tall guy (6'4""), didn't feel like my knees were getting crushed. The entertainment system had plenty of good choices. Food was good as well. Nice flight."
Oct 2019,50,Hawaii,"We used United for our round trip to Hawaii. We flew from RDU to Newark then nonstop to Honolulu. The return trip was Honolulu - Los Angeles - Washington,DC - Raleigh. All flights were on time. The United app was great. We were provided texts to our next gate with estimated walk times. We were also able to use mobile tickets. The app is a must if you fly United."
Oct 2019,50,Great flight Best Landing EVER,My biggest complaint about United is that they are inconsistent with their service. I have flown to Hawaii twice and am currently in Guam in the last thirty days. I am happy to report that their service has been consistent for the better on the last three trips. I flew business class for both flights to Hawaii and back and I did not get the upgrade on my current trip to Guam. The service was friendly and everyone seemed to enjoy their jobs. Our flight home from Hawaii on our second trip was cancelled because of the typhoon. United got us rescheduled as soon as possible with little stress for us. I highly recommend United Airlines.
Oct 2019,40,United Used to Better,"United did an ""ok"" job. It has never been impressive as of late though. I was happy that there was enough overhead cabin space for each of my family members (4) suitcase. I was not impressed with the fact that we paid extra for the legroom. (We were in the back of the plane on the way home & it didn't seem to be much of a difference.) The onboard entertainment (screens in the back of the headrests) were quite poor. Not only did they have to reboot it twice because many screens weren't working, but my son's screen stopped working all together. Good thing he could just look over at mine.  On a slightly different issue, back in the days when I used to fly with my parents in the 70's & 80's, United used to make you feel special that you were going to Hawaii. There was the flight attendants' outfits (Hawaiian themed), macadamia nut snacks, and even an onboard game (Half Way to Hawaii). It just had the feel of extra Aloha on board. Today, you wouldn't know the difference between this flight and one to Chicago as it feels like every other flight across the country. I miss the old days."
Oct 2019,10,Love to break up families with toddlers,Booked a row for my wife son and I. The air line moved out seats with out telling us. Put my wife 2 rows back and changed the seat from a window to a middle. Moved and aisle seat to the middle for my son. The attendant was rude and told me to figure it out on my own on the plane. Great business model to break up families with young kids.
Oct 2019,40,"Comfortable, easy flight","The flight was relatively short, smooth and comfortable. The ongoing issue is with pitch - distance between seats."
Oct 2019,10,Excessive Change of Flight Fees & Excessive Delays,"1. United claimed they had discontinued the direct flight from SFO to BNA and rerouted me through Chicago. This caused a 3.5 hour delay in the return flight.  2. There was a 4 hour delay in Chicago which caused me to miss an important meeting.  3. The guy pushing my wheelchair in Chicago was extremely sick with the flu. I caught the flu from him and had to return early. In order to change my flight, I was charged an additional $1,110. This was absolutely ridiculous. This was a lot more than I could have purchased a direct flight from another airline. I will never fly United again!"
Oct 2019,10,Small connecting flights seem to be a big issue.,"My husband and I were recently travel to and from Tokyo, and we don't normally fly United airlines. Normally we use Southwest or a different international carrier.    What was going to be a smooth flight from Buffalo to DC and DC to Buffalo on the way back turned into a nightmare.    Mind you. The people that work for United were all great! That's was never the issue. The issue is that all of these planes for the small connecting flights tend to need maintenance A LOT. . .    Long story short our flights were moved around so much that our DC to Tokyo flight turned into Buffalo to Philly to San Francisco to Singapore to Tokyo, and our return flight from DC to buffalo was delayed as of right now. I am still currently sitting at Dulles airport waiting for my flight to Buffalo that was originally scheduled for 5:45pm."
Oct 2019,10,Terrible experience,"Traveling United has been the worse experience EVER! They are never on time and always full of excuses why and their stories change. First it was the pilot coming from another location, then it was an oil leak and now it’s a brake pad! At least keep the story straight. Never, never, never travel United unless you don’t mind it may take you 24 hours to get to your destination even if it’s across 2 states! Absolutely ridiculous!"
Oct 2019,40,United did a great job,"United from Athens with a stop in Zurich was great!  Planes were on time and clean, comfortable and had good movies    Everything was perfect until we landed at SFO and had to wait a full hour to park at the gate! That was terrible management but the rest was great!"
Oct 2019,10,Worst travel experience -EVER,"Supposed to arrive in San Jose by 10 AM on a Saturday (by flying out of Cedar Rapids at 6 AM) but due to technical issues with the plane and then a terrible job of handling time and scheduling, it took another TEN AND A HALF HOURS to get to CA. Did not arrive until 9:30 PM. To add insult to injury, United broke our suitcase.    Over the course of the morning waiting at Cedar Rapids, we got 15 text messages about constant delays, gate changes, and cancelled flights but nothing was consistent and we had to keep updating family on the change in plans.    The trip home ended up being just as terrible. Called customer service to complain that the original flight that we bought had had a 3 hour schedule change--we were supposed to get back to Cedar Rapids at 8:20 PM but would not arrive now until 11:30 PM.    This is the worst airline and if you're ever trying to get anywhere on time and stress free--do yourself a favor and never fly United. I won't be doing business with them anymore."
Oct 2019,50,Best domestic flight.,"We travel all of the world include domestic area also. United domestic flight service was improved! Staffs are so friendly, two times free drink service and snack purchase service. We are frequent user so they provided special service and up grade also. We definitely use this airline as much as we can. Please try It. Online check in recommended."
Oct 2019,40,Choosing your seats doesn't always work.,"We went to California for a family party last weekend. Everything was terrific, the flight out, the party, the food however the flight back had an issue. They changed the plan and the seats we had chosen were changed due to the plan's configuration. My wife, who has a fractured toe, wanted an aisle seat. We were put in the middle two seats of a 4 seat row. It was inconvenient but not life altering. Our goal was to make it home in the time we had allotted. We accomplished that. So just be prepared if an airline changes your seats, just roll with it. At least they got you on your flight."
Oct 2019,40,"Cheap, On Time, Comes with Snack","Flight to Denver was on time and flight back to Boston was actually 40 minutes early! First plane was equipped with PTVs, though I did not use mine. Seats were reasonably comfortable, and prices were very affordable, especially considering I purchased my ticket a week before the flight. Checked baggage, seat reservations, and even additional carry-on do cost extra, so you should factor this into the overall cost. Personally, keeping price constant, I would not hesitate to fly United for domestic US again."
Oct 2019,20,Always dreadful.,"What is there to say? The seats are cramped, the plane was hot. For whatever reason, we seemed to have had a ‘woke’ pilot who gave us an informative talk before takeoff about how much fuel we were going to be ‘burning’ just to the ‘end of the runway’ and comparing it to car travel. Sorry United, I didn’t have a spare 6 days to do the round trip drive to TX and back."
Oct 2019,10,United airlines,"This airlines a joke.  First flight delayed an hour and a half due to crew needs rest time. That’s faa mandated, but it means they were maxed out time wise, then my connection flight has a issue with the brakes. They fix it and taxi out for the 2 time and then say they need to return to the gate again due to crew member will time out.  I fly southwest a lot, never had this issue. I flew United and had it twice in the same day. And, the flight time was a half hour flight!  Sat on the gate way way longer than the flight  Lesson learned, I will never fly United ever again.  Weather delays, mechanical issues I get. Running flight crews that close to maxing out I can’t.  So good by United."
Oct 2019,50,Great service ありがとうございました,"My flight was canceled due to the big typhoon struck Japan. But UA staff was so kind as to let me know the options from them. So I could fly to NY at the earliest. The hotel I stayed there was so greedy to hinder my rebooking, but UA was not.  電話にて、台風の影響による日程調整で大変お世話になりました。どの方もとても親切なスタッフで、シートに空きがでたら自ら連絡してくれました。一方で宿泊したホテルはExpedia経由であることを理由に、意味不明なメッセージを送ってきて日程変更を拒否、とても深いな思いをしましたが、それに比べてUAはとても親切でした。"
Oct 2019,50,Great flights to the Denver area and Philadelphia area,"All four flights I had went great and I didn't have any issues. The flight attendants were courteous and nice. The drink and snacks as always were the same as any other flight, and some of the flights had screens in the seats and you could watch Directv for free. Over all it was a great trip"
Oct 2019,50,Excellent service,"From bag check to arriving into SFO, every step of the way was pleasant. The cabin crew displayed amazing class in the face of childish behavior in our fellow passengers.  I don’t know how they tolerate the ignorance of so many fellow travelers.  The service was professional and attentive.  Very pleasant flight home. Will rebook without hesitation. We have found our last few flights to be consistently impressive.  Nice job United."
Oct 2019,20,Hated it.,"Two of the flight attendants were not friendly and were rude. My original booking was to fly ANA from Chicago o'hare to Narita but United changed my itinerary at the last minute. After 13 hours, trash was overflowing in the bathrooms and floor was wet. You will never see this on ANA which I have flown many times. Food was not great and only in small portion. There was not enough snacks only some left over Japanese rice crackers. I would rather pay a little more and fly ANA or JAL than fly United. Unfortunately I have another long flight coming up with United in a few weeks."
Oct 2019,50,Friendly Staff,From the help I received at check in until landing the service could not be faulted. At the boarding gate the gentleman there had a sense of humour and willing to help with carry on. Flight staff were also frindly. Would fly United again.
Oct 2019,50,Night Flight,"Despite nearly an hour weather delay at Dulles, arrived on time. Cabin crew are great, even the food seems to have improved."
Oct 2019,20,Terrible service and seats in business/first,"I travelled internally from EWR to FLL and must say how terrible the whole experience was. The check in was dis jointed, no lounge for passengers (apparently not for internal now) seats were uncomfortable and surposed to be first (more like business) not a real selection of drinks (we wanted sparking water) and no choice of snack just a veggie wrap ...... We paid over $300 bucks each for a one way flight for what ? And A to B trip. Staff did not go out of their way with smiles or help. I don't think I would use United again."
Oct 2019,40,pleasant experience,I recommend premium economy. We didn't know any better. Seems worth the money for the space.otherwise try to pay extra for the bulkhead.
Oct 2019,30,Latest United Flight not good/Economy tickets are not worth it,"We had flown United before and were happy. But this last time was terrible. We did the economy and I guess I did not pay attention. Economy is basically your seat and the area under the seat in front of you. You cannot bring a carry or you get charged for the carry on. So when I got my email confirmation I saw that I was not allowed a carrry on. And I could not afford to pay extra so I had to stuff the items in a backpack. Not fun.    Then when you go to check in, since you are economy you have to go to the ticket counter to get your boarding pass. You cannot check in online. So when I went to the ticket counter the lady walked me over to the kiosk. Then I had to wait for her to come to the kiosk to verify that I only had the backpack and no carry on. She asked me if I had a carryon I said no only the backpack and then in a stern voice she restated that carryons are not allowed and if I had one I would have to pay extra.    The whole experience was frustrating and disappointing.    The flight attendants were the only highlight as they were friendly.    We will not fly United again. Sad because we had in the past."
Oct 2019,50,Uneventful and Safe,This was a routine business trip from Portland to Denver and then Denver to Detriot. United is usually my preferred airline and they didn't disappoint. All of my flights went off without a hitch. Crew was pleasant and the flights were enjoyable.
Oct 2019,50,Surprise in the Skies!,"UA's ""Basic Economy"" doesn't seem like much different since I flew last years. Except that in-flight entertainment--& I don't mean the flight attendants' dancing thro' turbulence! Both flights had WiFi accessibility so make sure you have a full charge for your devices! There's lots to choose from TV shows to movies, even documentaries. Made the time go by quickly.  Warning: Do NOT take another seat if it's vacant and in the next level up from Basic Economy...or you will be charged more!"
Oct 2019,20,Not allowed to combine weight and poor attitude,"When we flew from London to LA we had no issues combining our weight of the cases, but coming back we were told we couldn't do this and had to stand and repack our cases and put things in carry on. Just a pointless exercise and a ploy to make extra money. I could probably deal with that on another day but the 2 people we spoke to were so rude. When we had finally sorted it the lady at check in was more interested in chatting to her friend and eating her sandwich. Then for good measure she literally threw our cases on to the luggage belt. Didn't even acknowledge we were there.  The flights were OK, seats were small and uncomfortable. Not really what you would expect on a long haul flight. Food was a bit touch and go. Movie choice on the entertainment was quite good though.  I would fly United if I really had to but I would probably try to use a different airline solely based on the attitude of the customer service and check-in staff."
Oct 2019,20,"Held Me Up For Bag Issue, Caused Me To Miss My Flight","Let me preface this by saying I had a good experience on the way to Los Angeles. It was the trip back that was unpleasant.    I tried to check myself in at the airport since I couldn't do it online due to their policy of having to check that I indeed had only one bag and not a carry-on for the economy fare. I did this on the way to LA with no fuss, so this wasn't surprising. However, when I waved an agent over, she said that I had to place my bag in some very small box. If it fit in the box, she would check me in. I placed my bag, but it fit on top of the box and didn't go in. I hadn't had to do this on the way there and there was literally the same things I traveled to LA with. This was a business trip and I didn't have time to go shopping to add to my bag, and it was snug with my laptop, clothes and a pair of shoes.    So, I had to empty my bag, making multiple attempts to make it fit in their small box. When I finally did, I waved another agent over and showed them it fit. However, now I had passed the point of check-in at the kiosk. So, I had to go on a line that the agent placed me in to complete check-in at the desk. I was annoyed, but it seemed everything would be fine. I was the only one in line. This was an early morning flight, so it wasn't yet packed with people.The desk agents only took care of people in the line next to me. After a few people were helped, I stepped up and asked when I would be assisted. I told my situation and found that I was placed in the wrong line. Again, the original agent had placed me there. I hadn't walked to it on my own.    So, I asked where I should go. I went to where they pointed and walked up to a guy who wasn't helping anyone but was doing something on the computer. Right away, he looked as if he couldn't be bothered. I told him the situation and he tried to flag down the agent that saw my bag fit. He was unsuccessful so I went to get the agent myself. The desk agent asked the other agent what my situation was. Mind you, I had already told him. He completely disregarded everything I said. The other agent confirmed my story. The desk agent then took my ID, typed something into the computer and informed me that he couldn't help me because I had passed the point of check-in and needed to be rebooked on another flight. He said there was nothing available for 8 hours. He walked away right after saying this. I couldn't believe it. I had been through this ordeal for an hour at that point, and was now being told I was going to miss my flight and had to wait 8 hours for another one. So, I rejoined yet another line.    Thankfully, another agent saw what transpired and flagged me down. I approached the desk again and she took my information. She searched through the computer and found 1 seat left on a flight 5 hours away. So, not 8 hours like the other agent had said. I thanked her and waited the 5 hours for my new flight. Interestingly enough, I reached the gate just as my original flight was leaving. The worst experience I've ever had with an airline, which speaks volumes as I've used Spirit before."
Oct 2019,50,Very accommodating/,The flight was not so packed and I was in the middle seat between to very large people. The attendant spotted this and asked if I would like to grab an end seat which was available a few rows up. Ty for your expertise to better a customers Pleasant flying experience.
Oct 2019,50,Thank You - Amy 2 from United,With protests going on in Barcelona over the past week my wife and decided to take the train to Madrid and fly home from there. Airport closures and flight cancellations were frequent. We contacted United as directed through United app for changes at no charge due to the situation. The first gentleman we contacted was not very accommodating but in the end put us on a flight a day later than our planned return. While on the train to Madrid my wife called back and was lucky enough to get Amy 2 who went above an beyond looking for the best option. She found a flight on the same day of departure with a connection through Frankfurt. There was a significant charge as it was a Lufthansa leg from Madrid to Frankfurt connecting to UA Frankfurt to Newark. My wife explained that we were not doing for fun but out necessity due to the civil unrest in Barcelona. Amy placed us on hold and came back with a no charge to change approval. We could not have been happier and cannot thank Amy 2 and United enough!!!!
Oct 2019,50,Friendly service,I don't fly very often. The staff was friendly and helpful which made the trip less stressful. I packed light so no additional fees or charges.
Oct 2019,30,Pleaseant flight,This was our return flight from a multi-week stay in Europe. Flight was on time and pleasant. Our only disappointment was that our United Club membership was not accepted in the lounge. It is a mystery to us as to when it will be accepted.
Oct 2019,40,Great Business Class,"The only thing wrong with flying from Phoenix to Barcelona is that it takes WAY too long to get there!! We flew first class/business class and our only complaint is that we had to take 3 flights - to Denver, to Washington DC, to Barcelona. Wish we could have cut that to two flights. Had free access to the United Lounge at each airport which was really nice - comfortable seats, free food and drink and wifi. All flights were on time and arrived on time."
Oct 2019,30,Avoid out of CLL,"I found the United agent to be condescending. Granted, I was screaming at her because I missed a flight that hadn't taken off yet. I was cursing the situation not her. I was definitely not threatening the airport. There were no other passengers in the area. Her threats to have me escorted from the airport by security were not called for. Then she reminded me not to miss the rebooked flight. I told her it was not possible to miss at this point (already here and where would i go at this point) and I got it. She said I obviously didn't get it because I missed the first flight.    Seriously??? That was rubbing salt in the wound and really unnecessary!!! I know I made a mistake. That's still no excuse for a ""professional"" to throw it in my face!    I flew to BCS or to Houston and took Ground Shuttle to BCS eight times in 2018. I will avoid United at this airport like the plague from now on. (I still like United in general, just not this agent at this airport. The airline refunded the upgrade to first on my flight out of IAH because my rebooked flight didn't have a first class seat available).    Ground Shuttle (CLL to IAH or reverse) is a terrific service and doesn't take that much longer."
Oct 2019,40,Vacation,Chose United for our Mexico trip. Well taken care of on coming and going flights. Plenty of room for our carry on’s. Would fly with United again
Oct 2019,50,Great flight,The security was fast n friendly all United staff was friendly smiling and helpful. Flight was on time.actually early arrival..  Direct fast flight from Orlando to NJ..  Would recommend this flight to anyone who is flying..
Oct 2019,40,In canes I’d delay not so many rights as with European airlines,We have good expierience on board but after a 24 hours delay and emergency landing we had no right on a compensation . So this is something to take into consideration when you are European and choose an American airline  As goodwill gesture we received coupons for a next flight but it wa food will not a right and we had not good expierience with emergency landing in the night and very poor assistance on the ground
Oct 2019,20,Business Class cubicle same width as Coach,"These sleeping cubicles are the most narrow I have seen on an airline. I would rather have just the standard wider reclining seat. No compartments to store anything. Every item must be in the overhead to takeoff and land for the entire business class. Perhaps the poorest design yet? Breakfast to Hawaii was continental or Quiche. Some of you may recall the days of the beautiful menu served meals, and Hawaiian flight attendant dresses. No more! 2200$ round trip for virtually nothing."
Oct 2019,40,Departed On Time & Arrived Early,"Departed on time and actually arrived early, can you imagine !    This was one of the few flights I have taken lately that was not totally full. My wife and I had a empty seat between us, how WONDERFUL."
Oct 2019,30,"Ok, But Better Experience on Other Airlines","Flight was a very good deal due to the low price I found on the web. Staff have been much nicer on other airlines. I asked for a window seat, but was told I had to accept the computer assigned seat as I had purchased a cheap ticket - something that has never been the case on any other airline I've used. Only free food was one small snack and beverages. Food was available for purchase at a reasonable price but I didn't purchase any."
Oct 2019,40,Departed and Arrived On-Time,"It departed Houston and arrived Vancouver on time. That is all I expect of an airline and this flight fulfilled my low expectations. This is a long, long flight. Almost 5 hours flying time.    Take note: the flight was totally booked and overhead space was not enough to accommodate all passenger carry-ons. Many bags had to be checked for lack of space. Seats are small, snacks were limited to one small package of pretzels and one small serving of soda. Inadequate over head space is always an issue now days.    As you might guess I am not a fan of airline travel. Airline service is poor and the TSA hassle is even worse."
Oct 2019,50,United really came trhokugh for me!,wonderful flight no issues. First time flying to Europe. United reallystepped up for me after an unfortunate situation last Spring. Thank you!
Oct 2019,50,Tickets cost a little bit more but definitely worth it,"This was one of those flights where everything went right. The tickets cost a little more than I had expected (this is because we often travel in budget airlines). The extra money was well spent. The service was excellent, we were impressed by how much leg room we had, the inflight entertainment and food were so much better than we are used to in budget economy. The flight took off on time and landed half an hour ahead of schedule - our bags were even waiting for us when we got to baggage collection. We really enjoyed this trip."
Oct 2019,10,UNITED AIRLINES HNL TO MNL: IMAGINE A LONG BUS RIDE IN THE 1970s,"United from Honolulu to Manila with a short layover in Guam: Made the trip multiple times..work purchases this ticket. I don't continue to relive this hell by choice. This is without question the worst trip you could make on any US air carrier.  1. HNL TO GUAM: The trip is roughly 8 hrs. The plane is a Boeing 777 that has been reconfigured for additional seats (less space - less comfort). Unless you are in business, you have no monitor.... so no on-board entertainment. United advertises there is on-board entertainment, but thats a half-truth. IF you bring your own tablet, or smartphone and are able to connect to their on-board streaming system that is difficult to connect to, not reliable, and will from time to time during every trip blackout due to 'satellite' complications. Bottom Line: There are no monitors and there is no direct service. So for this trip, plan on staring at the person's head in front of you. Flight Attendants: The only time you will see a flight attendant is when they come through selling sandwiches and drinks.... oh yea -- an 8 hr trip with no meal service. In short, the flight attendants are only available to you when they are vending food similar to a ballpark / stadium vendor.. except at a much higher price than you would pay at a ballpark.  2. GUAM TO MNL: 3 hr. trip. I believe this to be the oldest operating plane in the United fleet. Extremely limited on overhead storage and always packed.  Seats have about 2"" of cushion -- uncomfortable! Upgrading to Business is a joke -- its a wider seat that doesn't move? Get Burger King before boarding... what is served is over-microwaved and of terrible quality.  3. Alternatives for HNL to MNL --  a. Philippine Airlines. Its a direct flight and cheaper. The Customer service is not good, but absolutely better than United Flight Attendants / Service.  b. Delta HNL to MNL via Japan. Cost you a few hrs more but the customer service, entertainment, and comfort of travel are FAR SUPERIOR and worth it."
Oct 2019,40,Trip was uneventful,Just pay a little more and do a small upgrade so that you can sit with your other traveler and somewhere nearer the front.
Oct 2019,30,"Nothing special, unless you are Global Services","It’s our hub, so gets you where you need to go, bu5as a1k million miler plus, it doesn’t matter    Not the cheapest and not always the most friendly to deal with. I find the crew is usually friendly,as well as the gate staff."
Oct 2019,40,Straight flight to Aruba,Both of our flights were smooth and we arrived early. My only annoyance was the boarding process. It was chaotic. Passengers were herded onto the plane in a very chaotic way. We were two rows behind first class and were boarded last. The zones were very random which took longer to board everyone on the plane.
Oct 2019,30,The wheelchair parade,"For different reasons I fly to Lima several times a year and I only use United. I am 1K and have a few perks that make my travel more comfortable than if I used other airline. Recently this flights going and returning from Lima have been delayed for more than an hour at a time, for many reasons. The service is Ok, the food in coach and even in Business First jus edible. But what takes the cake every time I take this route is the great number of wheelchairs that parade ahead of anybody into the plane. I have asked some of the users of this service and even airline staff and I have been told that travel agents in Peru are quick to recommend to request wheelchairs to anybody that wants to board ahead of all the passengers, regardless of handicap. In fact that way they get first selection in bin space and also they board with their extended family and usually excessive hand luggage. One time I counted 42 wheelchairs in one single flight. My wife has called to my attention that many of the ladies in those chairs wear high heels, no good for somebody that requires a wheelchair! Obviously these people take advantage of the good will of the company, but it is in direct detriment of all other passengers. I have written United many times commenting on this abuse and suggested that they could reduce the number of abusers by just asking for a bona fide medical certificate, limiting the number of pieces of hand luggage they could carry and perhaps boarding wheelchairs last. Nothing has been done."
Oct 2019,30,UA 2039,"United Airlines is the General Motors of air travel. A letter grade ""C"" experience on the standard bell curve and that's perfectly OK. No complaints here. The boarding process was smooth. Legroom for my 6-foot frame was just restrictive enough to make me wish I bought a higher-priced ticket. The food options were ordinary. The plane arrived on time."
Oct 2019,20,They have limited the lounge in Malpensa to Business Class,"I am disabled and am a Gold Mileage Plus member. I therefore fly with them as they give access to their lounges due to my Gold status when I fly internationally. I was therefore shocked on this flight to learn that United has limited lounge use at Milan's primary airport (MXP) to Business Class only. Therefore, I was put in the position of not being able to use a bathroom because you cannot leave bags unattended and I am unable to carry my bags (which include medical equipment) to the restroom from my gate. Just one more slap from the ""unfriendly"" skies airline at least as far as disabled customers are concerned."
Oct 2019,50,The flight crew was great!,This was a great flight back from Rome. The flight attendants made us feel welcome and comfortable. The pilots did their best to keep us out of turbulence and kept us updated. We landed on time and attendants warmly said goodbye as we left the plane.
Oct 2019,50,United Airlines,"United Airlines consistently manages to meet or exceed customer expectations from the in flight entertainment to overall customer service. Faithful to its luxurious Chicago roots, United manages to always with little gestures enhance customer experience. Flight experience is nothing but a peaceful ride from coast to coast, flight attendants consistently show high degree of professionalism, and the Pilots show the quality of service via flight experience. It is just very peaceful flying United Airlines. In my opinion, it is one of the best airlines consistently so from the financial crisis days of 2002 till the present time. One of the most admirable companies."
Oct 2019,50,Great crew,Nice plane with real Polaris seats. Great crew. Friendly and attentive service. Good food and wine. Arrived on time.
Oct 2019,30,U.S. airlines,"When it comes to flying, unless you can afford 1st class, there is little to talk about.  Mediocre comes to mind when you consider seating ( lack of room or comfort ), service, or lack there of, entertainment, or food. Yes, mediocre."
Oct 2019,40,Uneventful which was good,I do have have Premier Silver Status which allows to a free upgrade to premium economy on day of check in if available. I did check but all upgrades where middle seats. My wife and I already secured the few seats the had only two in the aisle. The aircraft seating in economy is 3-4-3 but suggest you grab a seats with two next to each other.
Oct 2019,30,Subpar flight,"Usually United flights aren't that bad. Just what you would normally expect from an airline today. But this flight was below average. The staff was friendly, but not that attentive. While passing out earphones, the flight attendant just stopped. She had done about 2/3 of the plane. It wasn't that she ran out of them, just stopped."
Oct 2019,40,Good flights this time,"1st leg was to Denver, I didn't have much time when we arrived so I had to hurry & take the tram to my next flight. We did leave Medford later than anticipated due to some issues. 2nd flight into DFW was great, no problems at all."
Oct 2019,30,Not so good flight !!,"The airline could not help it, but to have a screaming child in the seat in front of you for a full 2 to 3 hours is a test of patience. My guess is his ears hurt him from the pressure. poor kid needed ear planes.That is something parents may want to get for a small child.I know the pain from experience .Plus I had another child next to me across the isle throw up! Oh yea worst flight ever for me.Hope it doesn't get worse next time or I may be crashing yet !!"
Oct 2019,40,On time,Travelled with no check in luggage. Got mobile boarding pass. Security line was not long. Boarding promptly done. Flight left on time and arrived about 30 minutes early.  Courteous and friendly staff. Nice and smooth flight.
Oct 2019,30,UA870,"Before I start - just letting you know I chose an aisle seat. Obviously I've watched too many TV programs that could make one nervous of flying ... and, consequently, the thought of trying to scramble out of a squashed [space between seats] situation amid potential chaos didn't appeal ... Actually - it amazes me how ruling aviation ""bodies"" even think the minimal space is anywhere near safe in an emergency ... anyhow that's not my gripe here.    Moving on ...    Dreadful environment. I fully acknowledge the greater deal of this flight is in a night sky. But ... stepping into the bat cave at 10.30am and thereafter very little light until landing the next morning at San Francesco was my worst nightmare. Either the mob I was on board with hated daylight or they simply did not know how to control the ""dimming"" windows, OR, who knows, maybe the crew took charge just wanted us all pacified. In any event the darkness for 13 odd hours was horrible. In fact I wondered how the crew managed a whole shift in a dark cabin. Maybe I missed something but we seemed to have the same people for the entire trip. Perhaps I was in a coma at some stage while fresh personnel were ""on watch"" ...    However, having said this, the crew where very pleasant and professional.    The flight itself ... well - a 13 odd hour flight in an economy seat is what it is (and for 165cm person it's fine). Got me there just the same as those in the pointy end even if I was a little more tatty around the edges. But the daylight at SFO was my greatest reward on leaving the plane.    Cheers and happy flying 👍😁"
Oct 2019,40,Trip over seas,Flight was comfortable considering the hours it took to get there. The blanket and pillow were nice to have on each seat.
Oct 2019,50,Smooth Flight,"We had a very smooth flight with United Airlines. I downloaded the App before boarding because I like watching movies during long flights. It wasn't a direct flight from Los Angeles to New York. We have layover at George Bush Airport in Houston. We had a little over an hour before our next flight, but I suggest if you have small little children, book a direct flight or at least 2 to 3 hours in between connecting flights so that you're not in a rush to get to one side of the airport to the other. Both connecting flights served mini pretzels and drinks. Planes were pretty new and doesn't smell like vomit. Coming back, our flight got delayed@LGA and almost missed our connecting flight at Chicago O'Hare. Most of the passengers that has connecting flight was running like crazy not knowing that the flight going to Los Angeles was also delayed!!! So yes, when the airline suggest to download the APP, download the damn thing. You can always delete it after. Having that information, saved us from sprinting from one gate to the other!!! Overall, we got a pretty good round trip fare. We also got a free carry on luggage, and one free personal bag which is pretty awesome!"
Oct 2019,30,Be careful if you have connecting flights,United has close to 100 gates in Denver. ELEVEN MINUTES TO RUN 71 GATES TO CATCH A CONNECTING FLIGHT!!! YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING!!! They scheduled this flight connection way to close. The gate agent would not call down to our connecting flight to tell them to hold the plane for nearly a dozen passengers. Otherwise an ok airline.
Oct 2019,30,Friendly service,"Friendly attendants and the flight was on time. Since the flight was not fully booked, it was very comfortable, allowing passengers to move about a little more freely than usual."
Oct 2019,20,"Uncomfortable, cramped, crowded, no space for bags in overhead lockers.","Small cramped seating, not enough leg room, no complimentary food and drinks on a five and a half hour flight. United is a full cost airline that should be a budget carrier. The staff were friendly and did their best with the conditions."
Oct 2019,50,Good trip,Overall it was great.. the personnel was very kind and helpful .the flights were in time .. everything was as I expected to.be. I have flown with UA other times and my experience with them is very good.
Oct 2019,30,First class flight to Dulles,Good flight from Newark to Dulles very bumpy towards the end but arrived more or less on time after leaving late. Comfortable seating. Service good but restricted by the weather issues
Oct 2019,40,Excellent Polaris class flight to Newark,"Polaris class (enhanced business) flight from Lima to Newark departed more or less on time and arrived early. Great food and wine, good movies, good service comfortable seats. What more could you ask for? Nothing..."
Oct 2019,50,Sensational,I flew LA to Sydney on the B787 and it was the best flight I’ve ever taken. The plane is brilliant. The seats are excellent. Comfortable. Service was great. There was nothing I didn’t like. Highly recommended.
Oct 2019,40,Homeword bound.,"When we checked in at the gate, we received new boarding passes, our original seats were in three separate rows, all windows, our new seats were the E in the same row, one across the aisle."
Oct 2019,10,"Horrible service, horrible airline!","United is in my opion the worst airline in America. We rejected a cheaper flight and paid more to reach our destination early and now we're stuck in Newark waiting for 4+ hours on the same late flight we were trying to avoid because they had a delay in getting us here and then left without us. Oh and the best part of it all is that the connecting flight left EARLY even though they knew we were here on our way over from another terminal. I have had issues with United for years, however, out of lack of options (and against my better judgement) we were forced to book with United again after having avoided them for years. The flight from Austin to Newark was delayed and we got to Newark where we landed and deplaned in a completely different terminal from the connection and had to run to catch a shuttle only to be left at the gate and have a rude agent tell us we need to go to customer service (again they left early). Then the customer service agent rebooked us but told us they can't deal with anything but rebooking. Oh wait! Then, while we were waiting, another set of people dealing with a similar issue came by and started yelling at another agent who offered to give them a refund! (Photo evidence attached). Don't fly United people. This is thier M.O. and they keep treating their customers like trash because we keep giving them our money and allowing it. Even when they're not dragging people off planes or having drunk flight attendant meltdowns they're just horrible! #BoycottUnited"
Oct 2019,20,Won't fly United again,"Horrible experience with United. First they kept us on the tarmac for about an hour and half for technical issues. They only served water.  Rows are cramped, flight attendants are rude, you need to use your own device to watch movies etc.    For every leg of our trip there was a technical issue that kept us in the airplane and tarmac for over an hour. Why can't they fix the issues before we get on the plane?    Food is horrible. Served the same exact thing on each leg."
Oct 2019,50,Belgium cookies Biscoff (Lotus) ... and friendly service,Flying is again better as it is now again with service of a small snack and drink on short distance ...
Oct 2019,40,Efficient flight,"Since I have silver status, I was able to get economy plus within 24 hours for free.  A seat in the aisle opened up, so the passenger next to me moved over. I then had 2 seats.  Movies were great.  An issue in Newark was that our gate was occupied, so we sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes. Not great as we were in the aircraft for 10 hours. Very annoying. I was ot a happy customer."
Oct 2019,30,Unpleasant flight attendants,"On our first flight, we had a tight connection and asked the flight attendant for assistance. He dismissed our concerns even though we had taken off late and were told we would have a long taxi upon arrival.  On our second flight, even though it was a longer flight and the airplane was 2/3 empty, the flight attendants did not offer refills or water after the first ask. In my opinion, they were just being plain lazy...how hard is it to move through an empty airplane with water service?"
Oct 2019,50,Ahead of Time,On time? No. Pleasant trip that brought us in to Chicago a half hour early. Fort Lauderdale airport easy enough to navigate but food prices outrageous.
Oct 2019,50,Business trip to Singapore,"My flight was great. Comfortable seating, quick stop in San Francisco for less than an hour and off we went to Singapore. The cabin was very cold initially but when I asked an attendant they quickly increased the temperature to a comfortable level. We arrived early on schedule. Same experience on the way back."
Oct 2019,20,changes not communicated to the travel truthfully,Unit airlines did not disclose to travelers traveling from Redding through San Francisco to SLC that the runways in San Francisco were under construction and travels had to go by bus to San Jose to fly to SLC.  then worse is the return flights were all cancelled with no notification and everyone had to be rebooked sitting in the airport for 6 hours and ended up in Sacramento with no way to get back to their personal vehicles which were at Redding airport 3 hours away!    Very bad business...  No apology or compensation.
Oct 2019,40,Good Service and on time,Overall it was good - a little rough but not their fault - they handled it well. No delay's - good service. Wish they have TV's - it was nice to have wifi for sure.
Oct 2019,40,good flight,"Boarding was delayed, but we ended up landing early. Flight was smooth and crew was good. Only wish I could have used some of my 200k plus award miles to upgrade to business class."
Oct 2019,50,Nice Surprise,I have not flown United for several years as their customer service was not very nice. Nice surprise! I had a wonderful trip. The plane only holds 50 people so it was full...The stewardess was great. Kind and thoughtful. 1 hour20 minutes. trip included drinks and a snack. She spoke to everyone. Very professional. Made a rough bumpy trip a breeze’.
Oct 2019,50,"Upgrade your seat, it's worth it","Not sure if my seat was considered First Class, Business Class, or something else, but I upgraded my seat from O'Hare to Albuquerque and back again about 5 days later. Well worth the $179 it cost me each way. Seats were MUCH larger, I had leg room, and a console between me and the personal next to me. I had a hot towel to wash my hands with, an actual snack (fruit & cheese, a veggie wrap) instead of a small bag of pretzels. I paid no fee to check my bag. Drinks were served in this section before we even left the ground while others were making their way to the back of the plane. The bathroom was at the front of the plane - not all the way in the back - and it was shared with 9 other people, not 70 or 80. This was the first time I upgraded my seat and I plan to do it again. I highly recommend it. Spoil yourself."
Oct 2019,50,"very professional all the way. organized, clean, safe","I use the mobile app for everything . United stayed in touch the whole time until the flight ended. Everything was very clean . Friendly flight attendants. Good snacks, on time. All of United resources are there to use and very good."
Oct 2019,20,Not nice,"We got to the Burbank airport two hours prior to the flight only to find out after sitting down at the gate that our flight to San Fran was delayed an hour. We caught our connection in SF only because our flight to Chicago was also delayed 90 minutes. The 757 that we flew to Chicago was ancient and and felt like it had ten extra rows of seats. It had no entertainment on the seat backs and the seats were the most uncomfortable that we had ever been in I am 5’6” and my knees hit the back of the seat in front of me. I can only imagine how uncomfortable anyone taller than me might have been. The airlines charge top dollar even for economy class and this plane was not worth one tenth of what we paid. I would never fly United again if at all possible. By the way, we missed our connecting flight to Syracuse in Chicago so we got to spend an extra three hours in Chicago. Oh boy!"
Oct 2019,10,Bad flight,"The flight back to Sao Paulo was the worst flight I ever made, the entertainment system didn't work, the flight was delayed three hours to leave Newark. Then the commander says, ""You have the ability to watch movies via the app."" But what if the phone battery runs out? The electrical part (where we would charge the phone) was not working either. It's nine hours of flight without entertainment, difficult right? What saved and lessened the feeling of disappointment was the crew who were good people, with a sense of humor and welcoming."
Oct 2019,50,"Quincy, IL to Las Vegas roundtrip","Super convenient. Quincy is a very small airport only one airline, only one TSA line. Only one plane. And it only went to Chicago (but from ORD you can go anywhere.) I hear next year they will have flights to both St. Louis and Chicago."
Oct 2019,50,Vegas Baby!,Awesome flight. Arrived before due time. Smooth flight. Very friendly staff. Plenty of room for carry-on bags.
Oct 2019,20,"Tight, Uncomfortable Seats and DELAYS","The flights were on smaller regional-type jets... but the seats were very narrow and uncomfortable. On our way to San Antonio, we stopped in Denver. Due to crew availability issues (so they said), we were delayed leaving Denver by an hour and half. On our return flights, we stopped in LAX. We were delayed for over three hours for (crew and replacement aircraft). Additionally, in our section of gates, every flight was suffering lengthy delays due to crew availability. I've never experienced these delays from United before."
Oct 2019,40,Smooth and on time,"Nice flight, it was on time, the economy plus seats were fairly comfortable and the onboard entertainment was very good. The crew was friendly and helpful. The entertainment system controls on top of the armrest are easily compromised, not sure where else they could put them?"
Oct 2019,50,on time and smooth!,on time no delays and smooth trip all the way!! Nice staff and comfortable travel! The flight was not full so we got to move seats for extra room. Very nice!!
Oct 2019,50,Satisfied,Our flight was a pleasant one. Thank God there are many viewing options on these long 13 hour trips! The food was good and the flight attendants were professional. I recall how smooth the landings were.
Oct 2019,50,"Smooth flight, arrived a bit early","After taking the flight to Europe in Economy, we decided to upgrade to premium economy (economy plus) for the return trip. I'm sure there are good seats in economy, but ours on the outgoing flight to Europe (back of the plane) were not so great. Noisy and it seemed to us, those seats were smaller. Despite not having much choice left in meals on that flight, it was overall a good flight. Flight attendants were great. On this, the return trip to the US, we enjoyed more leg room and just more room overall. Our seats were right behind first class so we had more to choose from in the meal service. Eating on a plane is never great (all those little packets to tear into!) but the food was fine. Our flight attendant noticed that my tray table had a definite slant to it and provided a pillow so that my table would lie flat. NIce, thoughtful touch. The free in flight entertainment tends to run to old movies and TV shows, but that was fine with me. I enjoy a good rerun. And of course I did spend some time napping as well. On board WC was clean. The one assigned to our cabin was midship and was more spacious that those in the back of the plane. Electronic communication from United to my IPhone was super. I like being kept up to date and their comms worked beautifully. We like United and would fly this airline again."
Oct 2019,50,United Airlines - an excellent experience,"I have not flown to the USA for 16 years and that was with another airline.    The booking procedure was straightforward and efficient.    My daughter had booked seat 43K on both the outward flight (UA949 - LHR to SFO) and the return flight (UA930 - SFO to LHR). Although this was the seat allocated to me on the return flight, on the outward flight I was allocated a seat in the middle of the middle row of seats! Not the end of the world but disappointing.    The UA staff at the airport were brilliant. They helped when I needed to process my passport and eticket, when I booked in my suitcase, at the boarding gate and when I boarded the plane.    The flight crew kept us informed during the flight, e.g. turbulent weather and the need to sit and fasten seat belts.    The flight attendants were friendly and efficient. The food was excellent and I was kept well hydrated.    You may say that they were only doing their job but in my eyes they made my trip stress-free and very pleasant.    If I ever fly to the USA again, it will most certainly be with United."
Oct 2019,50,Smooth process!,"We did another international flight with United. Boarding was on time and efficient. Leg room was good, service was good, food was... airline food... key thing is we arroved 40-minutes early and we didn’t have to wait on the tarmac for an open gate! Deplaning was efficient and crew was professional."
Oct 2019,50,Back home,This was a great flight. The configuration of the first class section was really conducive to sleeping. Too bad this was an afternoon flight from London to DC and I really did not sleep at all. The service was great for the 8 hour flight.
Oct 2019,30,Customer service was a nightmare,"I recently booked a flight to Italy for a family wedding. Since I’m unsure about online booking I called the United Airllines Milage Plus. From the get go this was a nightmare. I booked the premium economy with customer service. All seemed good until the next day when I realized they didn’t get my passport info. I called back and was told since the name on my reservation (the name on the reservation was the name on my credit card, which doesn’t have my full name, which is hyphenated) wasn’t the same as the passport, I would have to cancel and rebook. And I would lose my money. After several calls the one rep finally said he’d put a note on my reservation. The day before I left I received an email to request my boarding pass. Since the name on my passport was different I was denied so I called the customer service, and was told I had to go to the airport. I was advised by several reps, all in the Philippines, that I could be denied boarding because of the passport being different than the reservation. I was also told my connecting flight in Frankfurt would deny boarding, and if I didn’t board that flight, my reservation will be cancelled and I’d lose my money. I called the airports and they said there would be no problem. On the flight over, I had two pieces of luggage...one included in the flight, one I paid $100.00. 8 had no problem on the flight from SF to Chicago, Chicago to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to Bari. However, as soon as I arrived in Bari I received a text stating the SF airport runway would be closed on my return flight Sept 10, so I had to call customer service and change my flight to either before Sept 8, or after Sept 26. The customer service stated I would have to change the date or cancel my return flight and reroute to another airport. I called my husband who called the airport and they said no international flights have been changed. A friend even checked the dates of the return flight from Frankfurt to SF and United was still selling flights from Frankfurt to SF on Sept 10. I received two texts regarding this and I disregarded them. I arrived at the Bari airport on Sept 10 and was advised my premium economy was only available with United in Frankfurt, so I had to pay full price for two pieces of luggage. Since I had no other way to get to Frankfurt (and besides if I didn’t board that flight my entire flight home would be cancelled) I just paid and let it go at that.  United Airlines Milage Plus customer service, which seems to be based in the Philippines is the worst I’ve ever experience. They lack knowledge of the basic i formation, refuse to help in any way, are rude, argumentative, and from what I’ve experienced..vindictive. I recommend anyone to do your own online booking and don’t deal with customer service."
Oct 2019,20,Ho hum airline,"This was the return leg with United. The overall feel was as if the staff was taking up space on the plane. Well I got to be here so I might as well do some work attitude. Could not eat the food, if you can call it food. One bite was enough. This crew needs a wake up call from their boss."
Oct 2019,10,Amazing this airline even exists,Flight check in had an issue printing our baggage tags. We were then offloaded despite:  1) That it was their system that had an issue  2) The flight had been moved earlier without any notice    Station manager at Flagstaff proceeded to blame us for not being ready 3 hours before despite all communication from the airline saying we only had to be ready 1 hour before.    Spent 2.5 hours on the helpline because the Station Manager said there was nothing else they could do.    Awful. American Airlines (which had a counter next to them) actually did more to assist us to get to Toronto that United did.
Oct 2019,20,Check in was awful,"We arrived a bit more than three hours ahead of our flight’s scheduled departure. We stood in the 1K Polaris line. We were the only customers, in any line, just waiting for service. The two check in personal were so busy in conversations. Eventually one of them approached us at the 1K/Polaris desk and tried to suggest we learn how to use the check in machines in the economy check in section. Once I asked why there was a 1K/Polaris section and we were already checked in and just needed our bags tagged! She made her colleague in economy section  tag our bags. Service at United ORF was AWFUL."
Oct 2019,30,Wish United would use a larger plane,"We flew at peak summer(August) and were on a smaller planewith only economy class. United could do much better than these little tubes that a normal person can barely stand up in. Considering they are flying to one of the premier Gulf Coast destinations(Destin) you would think they would want to shine. They don't when using the smaller planes. At least upgrade to Embraer 175 on all flights. Not terrible, but definitely could be better."
Oct 2019,10,United is not happy until you're not happy!,"Never been made to feel so unvalued. My wife and I could not get adjacent seats. When we got on the plane there was a uniformed female flight attendant in the seat next to me. I politely asked if she would be willing to change seats with my wife and she just loudly huffed, didn't even look me in the eye, and wore a scowl on her face for the whole trip. She was within her rights, but that didn't make it right. And she made it a point to make me feel low and uncomfortable the whole flight."
Oct 2019,50,Passengers were priority...,The flight was fine except the entertainment electronics were not working. The captain apologized and each passenger was offered a generous voucher toward another flight.we just booked another flight using the voucher and the process was smooth.
Oct 2019,40,Full Marks on the timing and connectivity,"I took the United Airlines from Delhi to Newark recently and think it was great value for money . The timings and connectivity was perfect , though they could do better on food quality"
Oct 2019,30,Standard. But good entertainment,"It was fine. Nothing really special or to make it stand out.  The entertainment package was good with up to date movies. Food was edible, staff functional.  Only real downside is the seat selection. Unless you pay WAY more to upgrade for nothing, you don't get to sit together. Shabby."
Oct 2019,30,cattle car travel,At least there was breathing room between the seat rows. Food was barely edible. Movie selection (only important because its a long daytime flight so you are a captive audience) terrible. Staff however were uniformly pleasant and friendly...
Oct 2019,40,International flight home,The flight was uneventful and that is a good thing. We left on time and arrive a bit early. The flight staff could not be any nicer. My only complaint is the food is awful.
Oct 2019,50,Super Convenient Connections,This long time (Now Retired) road warrior really appreciated the easy connections and service between a medium sized city of Huntsville and my small city of Prescott with a change of planes in DEN. Walking between the connecting gates was eye opening for the greatly expanded selection of destinations with direct flights from DEN. Service was on time and quite cordial onboard.
Oct 2019,30,No help!,I need a wheel chair and united in Newark did not provide one at curb side. I was traveling alone and had to walk inside and down the hall. Sa there for over 20 minutes.Stewart on the plane was nasty.They should board the plane back first.
Oct 2019,30,Packed aircraft little sevice,"A Boeing 777, 300 plus passengers on a 6 hour flight. The information in the magazine was a selection of foods to buy. Nothing was offered. Back of the seat, no screen to watch anything or the map which is interesting. You could plug in your tablet if you had one. United not my first choice."
Oct 2019,50,Perfect!,On time both ways! No stops! Need I say more? It was great! There are not a lot of non-stops from Shreveport.
Oct 2019,30,No frills airline flight,"My son and I took a quick end of summer trip to Hawaii before he headed back to school. We flew United Airlines out of SFO to Honolulu. We weren't allowed any carry on luggage, we had to pay $30 to check a small rollerboard suitcase, which other airlines would allow. (Hawaiian did on our return flight, no charge). The flight took 5 hours, and during that time we were offered a free beverage and a small packaged cookie. The flight attendants offered a glass of water later in the flight. No movie, no music, no complimentary food. Food for purchase only. Only a 5 hour flight but seemed much longer Happy we chose Hawaiian on the return. Comp sandwich, cocktail, movies, music and could bring our carry on with us, no charge. These small things really make a huge difference!"
Oct 2019,10,Terrible,Terrible airline - I travel several times a month and it’s by far my least favorite of the domestic airlines
Oct 2019,20,Ok for price?..,"The price was right but the food was terrible, the inflight was below average, for a 16 hour flight they really to to improve there inflight entertainment as well as the food ,"
Oct 2019,50,Good experience,"Good experience, hassle free and good support from personnel. I had a very short connection in Houston but they were able to help me get on board!"
Oct 2019,10,NEVER AGAIN,"I had SPIRIT on NEVER Fly IT list. United now has proudly joined the list.  I had terrible experience with them last year, but this was the last straw.  I had reservation from Ft. Lauderdale to Newark and the cost was $68. I could have easily chosen Delta or others for maybe for $5 more. Foolishly I went with United.    At the gate, they insisted they will have to charge $55 for my smaller than average carry on while all other airlines allow one carry on free. I said what is the normal fee for carry on, they said $30! I said why are you asking for $55, she proudly said due to penalty you didn't check at the gate. There was 15 minutes to the flight. She suggested I could go back to the terminal, pay $30, go to through the security and take another flight since I would not make this flight!    If that is not an extortion I don't know what is. It is like they have the code for your ATM machine and they will use it weather you agree or not!    So congratulations UNITED, now you have joined the NEVER UNITED along with NEVER SPIRIT list.  Do yourself a favor, pay another $5, 10 or even $20 and fly other alternatives to UNITED. The worst attitude, and service ever."
Oct 2019,50,good flight,"i took united to get back from dallas yday after a hectic meeting schedule and everything was pleasant, worked like magic"
Oct 2019,30,United rebooked my flight,"I normally fly from Albany, NY to Chicago to Honolulu. There were storms and United automatically re-booked me. Good because I arrived in Honolulu only about 2 hours later than if I had my original flight plan. Went from Albany to Newark to San Francisco then to Honolulu. Nothing wrong with United or staff just a different bunch of people flying than if I had just 2 stops. Lots of kids and babies, ended up next to them. One was about an 11 year old boy on the spectrum. He kept touching my stuff and flailing around and hooting. It took half the flight for the mother to finally put him next to the window even though I asked as soon as he started going for my drink. There was no reason for him to be between her and me. I guess I should have talked to an attendant."
Oct 2019,50,Good flight from Rome to Washington,"Flight was good-boarded and left on schedule, landed exactly on time. This is a good flight to take to Washington because at the arrival hour, Dulles airport is practically deserted. So we whizzed through passport control. There is no separate Customs and nobody asked what we purchased abroad. Food was good, and service was good. Bags arrived promptly."
Oct 2019,30,"good economy plus seats, terrible entertainment system","my aisle seat in economy plus was reasonably comfortable, with plenty of legroom. The food offered for purchase was decent, as well. However, United, like several other domestic airlines, has decided to save money by eliminating seat-back displays for the entertainment system. Instead, passengers are encouraged to use their devices to watch movies or TV shows. If one downloads the UA app on a smart phone (in advance) then this works, but the resulting screen is VERY tiny. On my Mac laptop, which has a reasonable screen size, the system failed to work. The UA website states that a specific plugin must be downloaded (in advance) but this plugin (PanasonicDRM) has not been available under Mac OS for a while. Thus, I had NO entertainment options for my 3.5 hour flight. Not fun!"
Oct 2019,10,WORST AIRLINE! Flight reservation cancelled without notice. Missed business trip!,"United has scorned me for the last time. They are literally the WORST airline with the WORST customer service. I have been loyal to united and am a silver premier status member and today they crossed the line. I had changed a reservation with the help of an agent to adjust for my own (admitted) error 48 hours after booking the wrong dates. No problems there.... or so I thought. I got the normal 'check in for your flight notifications' the day before my flight, and then even the morning of the flight I was able to check 'my flight status' to confirm the plane was on time. It wasn't until I was on my way to the airport that suddenly my reservation disappeared (which i ONLY noticed because I checked the status of the flight again -- very windy day in DC). So then I had to spend the next 30 minutes trying to run around and find out what happened, only to find out my reservation had been cancelled. Now I have missed the business meeting and event I needed to travel for, with no other options to make it on time. Two months ago they lost my luggage which contained all of the clothing for my entire family for my grandfathers funeral. Last year they lost another piece of luggage. This is the WORST airline and I will be promptly finding a different airline to give all of my business to (and I fly very frequently for business). DON'T FLY UNITED!"
Oct 2019,50,Upgraded to Polaris from Premium Economy,"We purchased premium economy tickets and used some global upgrades for polaris. We got upgraded about one week before so we were surprised by the early upgrade.  We were able to use the Polaris lounge at SFO and it is a completely different lounge than the other United Clubs but still not as good as some Asian or European lounges.  Polaris is, of course, a 1000% upgrade from even premium economy. Your seats are like private cubicles that transform into beds. You can ask for free pajamas that you can take home, and I recommend using them during the flight. When the seat is converted to a bed you can ask for a pillow top to make it more comfortable. The food and service are also excellent. No plastic trays covered with pull out plastics or aluminum and the food is almost a la carte like a restaurant but with a very small menu. Not all the food is good so stick to what you like, don't try exotic dishes. Each seat has its own luggage bin so you don't have to share it with other passengers. Because of the configuration and spaciousness of the seats, my wife and I were seated next to each other but too far to be able to talk. On the way back we chose the seats that were closer so be sure to select the right seats or change seats with other passengers."
Oct 2019,30,Don't expect too much in premium economy,It is almost like economy class but the seats are bigger and more comfortable but still not comfortable enough to sleep. The food is the same food as economy class served in the same plastic trays. I was seated on the first and my seat was very crowded with the monitor and food tray open so I just decided to watch movies on my phone.
Oct 2019,10,Still the same old lousy airline that should have gone away after their first bankruptcy,"United screwed up our reservation on our flight from SFO to Denver. When we went to print our boarding passes it showed that my partner had the same last name as myself. She has a different last name and ID so the boarding pass would not work. The two insolent attendants in the kiosk area would not help. In fact they kept claiming that it was my fault even though I produced an itinerary showing the different last names. Since there are no reservation agents in the entire SFO domestic terminal, we had to find a quiet place in the airport to re-book new tickets. Had there not been a flight one hour later than our scheduled flight, we would have been screwed. Not sure about a refund for Their mistake. Remember with United the customer is always wrong.  So I'm back to Southwest again where this never would have happened. I would rather fly Air Koyro (the North Korean airline) than take United. Hopefully on United's next bankruptcy (that will be the third) they will finally be allowed to die, as it should have happened the first time."
Oct 2019,20,They got us to the location... and that's about it!,"Can't believe how low the service level in on flights these days. We were perared for the spartin amenities... but one soft drink and a small pack of cookies on a nine hour flight is really cheap on their part. Only thing I wonder is if they'll install pay toilets as the next step to squeeze a few more bucks out of their coustomers. Home town airlines? - Yea, right; treated like the chattel they believe their passengers are these days."
Oct 2019,10,Simply awful,"There is absolutely no reason to return to the United lounge in Honolulu. It was drab, dingy and completely uninviting, and the food.... what food!!! Awful! Do not waste the time on the walk to this lounge."
Oct 2019,40,Smooth flying,Flight was a full one but everything went smoothly. Flight left on time and arrived in Houston about twenty minutes early. We were happy to fly United.
Oct 2019,30,Depends on plane style,"The first leg of trip SD to San Francisco was on a 737. Cramped seats, but nice in flight entertainment. One hour flight, didn't really need it. Second leg, SF to Vancouver on a Airbus, more legroom but no inflight entertainment. The pretzels and waffle cookies were nice. Nothing to right home about the flights, but much better than Lan."
Oct 2019,40,A generally good airline,"Fortunately, I am a million-mile member flyer on United Airlines, so we get upgraded to Premium Economy for no additional cost. We usually take the day flight to London as it leaves at 8:30am and arrives at 8:40pm, so we get a good night's sleep when we get there. This plane was almost one hour late - it was about 1 1/2 hours late on departure, we drove to a motel after we got there, so we lost a little sleep. As usual, the line at Immigration was extremely long so it would have taken many hours to pass through, but some official took pity on us (because I am 84, and my wife is 78) so directed us to the Fast Track line (that was currently empty), so we got through very rapidly."
Oct 2019,50,"Super service, on time","We were to connect in Chicago for an overseas flight. Weather in Chicago was causing delays. We arrived at the Cleveland airport early and went to check out bags. The woman at the counter saw our connection and offered to put us on an earlier flight to Chicago that had been delayed in arriving in Cleveland. She then also checked our bags all the way through to our final overseas destination (a total of three flights). And they arrived! She was what customer service was all about. Our return flight from Chicago to Cleveland actually arrived in Cleveland 15 minutes early. Thank you, United."
Oct 2019,40,Very nice flight!,This was my first time flying United Airlines and I was very pleased. I really like the free inflight entertainment! Makes the flight go by so fast! And they also provide a free blanket for the red eye flight! That was nice! I think I will be flying United more often now! More comfortable seat too! Good deal!
Oct 2019,40,"Service friendly, nice in flight entertainment choices, seats very cramped","The flight was on time, friendly service and had in-seat flight entertainment which was nice. Seats were very tight."
Oct 2019,20,Lost a day on Maui,"Due to SFO runway closure, United rebooked us through LAX rather than SFO. This took four hours and talking to 3 non-English speakers before we talked to a supervisor. Unfortunately, she neglected to reserve our seats, which she said she had done, and booked us on a flight that originated in, yes, SFO. So our later flight that day was another four hours late. Instead of getting to Maui at 11:30 am, we got there at 10 pm. Flight itself was OK after waiting at LAX for four hours."
Oct 2019,40,"Good seats configuration, excellent amenities, but same old american service","The plane was an old B767 retrofit with new interior. Seats are reasonable comfortable for Asian but believe it would be too narrow for Standard American size. Food was quite good. One of the FA was very talkative, explaining how much she hates the new seat! Another FA cannot tell me where the life-vest is located and had to come back with a torch light to find where it is. Safety VDO presentation featured Spiderman, which seems to be innovative, but it is not serious enough to spell out safety concern/procedure."
Oct 2019,10,A new low in customer service,"United, if you don't want anyone to purchase basic economy, don't offer it. But if one buys it, they deserve the same service as everyone else. I went to check in online for a business trip for which I only had my computer bag, but because I had basic economy they would not let me check in online. I had to go to a gate agent to confirm that I did not have a bag before I could get a boarding pass. Trying to travel as light as possible has now been penalized by the airline who penalizes you for taking luggage as well. Such pettiness added almost an hour to my trip due to ticket lines. I'm sure some clever moron thought this would make you less likely to buy basic economy. They were half right: it has made me less likely to travel on United. I have notified our travel secretary to book everybody on airlines other than United in the future, because even if the cost is slightly more, the convenience will be worth it."
Oct 2019,20,Flying S#%*ks,Older 737 No USB ports for charging. Very little legroom. Entertainment is not on demand. Movies were in progress by the time we were underway. On return flight entertainment console did not work at all. Hope you brought your own headphones.
Oct 2019,50,Round-trip Newark/Italy,"Change in equipment resulted in us being a bit squeezed. Otherwise, the flight as great. Flight attendants were very friendly and considertae, food was good."
Oct 2019,40,Excellent flight; no problems,Great flight. Premium Economy gives you more leg room which was very nice. United charged us for our 2 bags going but we were able to get them free on our return trip since we are Mileage Plus members. Argue and you will get them for free.
Oct 2019,50,International with Comfort,"We flew NAP to FRA to ORD in complete comfort. On international flights, coach just doesn't cut it and United knows how to do it in Premium Plus. I highly recommend (especially for those of us with long legs) -- comfy seats, attentive flight attendants, and great entertainment options.    Only issue was -- about 5 hours in my husband asked about purchasing a snack -- and they had nothing available for purchase. They have the meals that they provide (which are as decent as airplane food can be), but sometimes you just need some pretzels or something and they had absolutely no snacks available."
Oct 2019,50,Wonderful Flight Attendant,"I flew First Class between San Francisco and Seattle in an A-320 and found that the cabin’s flight attendant turned a good trip into an excellent journey. A frequent flier on United, I rarely experience the level of service on the carrier that this woman provided. She addressed me by name, came around often to check on her eight passengers, offered drinks and snacks throughout the almost 2-hour flight and helped out in the Economy section. She truly personified the “friendly skies” of United with her genuine smile and affable personality.    The flight itself went well, from the smooth boarding procedure and on-time departure to arriving on schedule. I considered the cabin to be clean and well maintained and my seat was quite comfortable. A minor downside was that the overhead bins initially looked like they could not hold the carryon bags for eight people. But passengers worked together to ensure that the space would be sufficient."
Oct 2019,40,Very Efficient Airline,"We flew Dublin to Newark and on to West Palm Beach a few weeks ago. United were good to travel with , their flights were right on schedule and their staff were very efficient. The seat size was also good , I felt comfortable through out the flight."
Oct 2019,50,Northern CA Wine,We had a direct flight non stop CLE to SFO. It was on time and had no issues. Traveling out of CLE is very efficient. We paid extra for a nicer seat that reclined and had extra leg room
Oct 2019,40,Delayed for Safety,Plane was delayed because the crew was filing a safer flight plan as we flew to Japan as Typhoon Hagibis approached from the south. Resulted in a smooth flight. Great service and a professional team.
Oct 2019,30,Trans-Atlantic Basic Economy,"I had to go thru hoops to just get our seat (wife and I) together. Their partner airline (Lufthansa) kept us together and provided more room (width and leg room). In the future, I will be look for Lufthansa flights."
Oct 2019,30,United: Still a preferred airline,"I’ve flown United for decades and had a good trip with them. Reasonable delays, great service (I enjoyed the free headsets and movies)."
Oct 2019,10,Delays with plane arrivals,"Today my 2pm flight from LGA to ORD was cancelled due to a “late plane arrival.” As a result, I also missed my 3:45pm connecting flight from ORD to SPI which was due to arrive at 5:30pm. To make matters worse, the next ORD/SPI flight was scheduled to depart almost 5 hours later at 9:15pm Central. It gets worse, due to another “late plane arrival” the 9:15pm flight is now bumped to 10:00pm. Won’t arrive in SPI until after 11:15pm. As a result, it will take me 13+ hours for 3 hours of flight time. Perfect weather=no excuses. This is simply unacceptable as I will now avoid United Airlines for all of my flight needs going forward."
Oct 2019,10,Clueless and don't care,"Their computers went down and no United flights were leaving. All the other airlines were flying out on schedule. By the time we took off it was so late we missed our connecting flight in Houston. Had to get a hotel and fly the next day. United put us up in an average hotel that I would never have stayed in. They gave us a $10 voucher for my wife and I to have dinner. That would not even let us eat a Kids meal at McDonalds. Missed a night at a 5Star Mexican resort. Never wil I fly United again, ever, never."
Oct 2019,30,Good...But Nickel & Dime,"Flight and gate experiences Were good. Hawaii check-in we were steered to a kiosk, with no customer service, lengthy, and luggage expenses again. Tired of being nickel & dimed adding to overall flight cost. I suggest Southwest Airlines which is expanding and bags fly free."
Oct 2019,10,Awful travel day,"Extremely bad day flying UAL.  The day before my flight I went on line to check in. The site showed no reservations for me! After additional looking and talking to an attendant, the attendant said that my flight was delayed, but after additional checking it was discovered that my connecting flight was cancelled - no notice provided to me.  Checked on line for flight status before going to the airport and all was OK. Went to the airport and was being told that my flight was 3 hours late as I received a text telling me it was time to go to the airport!  Because I was going to be 3 hours late I would miss my connecting flight, so they rescheduled my connection.  The connecting flight arrived in Denver on time and then had a 2 hour mechanical delay.  I was supposed to get home around 8:30 but instead arrived around 2:00 AM.  Terrible experience with UAL"
Oct 2019,30,United was my airline,United use to be a upper level airline NOT any more. We flew 1st class from Hawaii to BWI which is a Long flight to begin with there was no way any one could sleep. People going back and forth and the flight attendant where constantly talking so if you didn't have earplugs there was no way to sleep. There was nothing special about this flight!!
Oct 2019,40,I always fly United!,I stick with United because they have non-stops to the places I travel. I also build up frequent flier miles and end up with at least one trip or 1 1/2 trips free per year.
Oct 2019,20,Boarding is like a 3rd world country,Had to drag luggage down the stairs and then up the plane ramp. There are the usual boarding ramps here. Not sure what the issue is. What if it was raining? Plane late. Agents unfriendly. Fights to Tucson from any major airport usually have crappy ramp conditions.
Oct 2019,50,Nice flight and Service,"I was fortunate to be booked in United's Business/First class. The Polaris pods are roomy and comfortable. The dining services were pleasant. The flight was smooth with little turbulence. Plenty of in-flight entertainment selections. So, I was able to relax on the way home.    Airport boarding was a bit slow since I was one of the random passengers that was screened at the gate in Lisbon. That process was slow. But, there was plenty of overhead baggage space in Business/First, so I was not adversely affected that way."
Oct 2019,50,Great,No complaints  Great service and in flight entertainment  Customer service could use just a little boost
Oct 2019,40,Flight to and From Banff via Chicago (O'Hare),Good flight but always issues at O'Hara with late flight or delays of some type - makes it very frustrating to fly through Chicago.
Oct 2019,30,United used to be a pleasure to fly,United is using 737-900 for these flights. They are packed and no leg room whatsoever. In economy they were only two bathrooms in the back and as soon as the seat belt light was on there was a line down the aisle for most of the flight. I get trying to make money but this is ridiculous.
Oct 2019,50,"Up, Up & Away","Wheel chair assistant, good. Airline employees all very professional. Flight round trip was just as expected. 2 bags checked and showed up without delay."
Oct 2019,30,Routine Flight,"I flew Polaris (Business Class) between Osaka and San Francisco on an A-320. Boarding went smoothly until I got on the plane. No flight attendant yet stood at the entry to greet passengers. As a frequent flier with United, however, I knew where my seat was located and immediately went there. From my vantage point, I noted it took a few more minutes before anyone arrived to interact with those boarding.    My seat proved to be comfortable and reclined completely. Slippers, blankets and pillows were provided. The audio-video system worked well and the toilets were kept fairly well cleaned. The cabin seemed to be in good condition and was not overly cold.    Most flight attendants were not especially friendly and seemed to be less than enthusiastic about their jobs. One man, however, stood out for his positive approach and helpfulness. The food was average and unmemorable.    The mostly smooth flight left on time and took about 8.5 hours, arriving 45 minutes ahead of schedule. Because of this early arrival, we had to wait for a gate to become available."
Oct 2019,10,Don't believe security email,"Received an email from United 3 days prior to flight warning of security screening delays and a to arrive at least 3 hours before international flight. Counter personnel refused to take bags until 2 hours prior, so we were forced to stand around for an hour and a half (along with a growing crowd of passengers). Friendly skies indeed."
Oct 2019,50,honeymoon\birthday,this flight was so smooth they passed out snacks on the way there and back we got a up grade on he seats which made the ride a whole lot better on the way back nice flight and staff
Oct 2019,10,Young children in economy,Just unreal! I called in days prior to verify my children that are 4 and 6 yrs old would be seated next to us. The checkin showed they were not. I was reassured that they take this matter seriously and no matter what we would be seated together. Get to gate and try to change. Sorry nothing we can do about it. Tell us to board plane and flight attendants will assist. They said it's not there job and told us to talk to passengers personally. Wtf I have to go ask people to move. As if it's not stressful enough traveling with children I had to deal with this BS. Never again!!!
Oct 2019,10,"Horrible airline, never fly with UA again","I booked ANA tickets from Newark to Thailand on 9th Sep 2019. The flight UA79 was cancelled before I arrived the airport. The ground staff told me the reason that there was typhoon in Japan so they have to cancelled the flight. They put me on the next day flight. However, I found out that they added another flight UA2805 flying the same time as UA79. This is really nightmare. The previous day, they swapped the aircraft from 3-4-3 seats (in economy) to 3-3-3 seats. Next day they cancelled the flight. This is really from the operational issue, not typhoon as they said. I have to booked the room near Newark which is very expensive. I was fined for ""no show"" fee at the hotel in Bangkok. The UA just gave me a stupid $150 travel certificate. I don't really need this. I asked them to take the stupid certificate back and reimburse the costs I paid due to this incident but the UA ignored my request. After this nightmare I am not going to fly with UA anymore why do I need this stupid certificate? I've never had problems flying with Oneworld airlines like British Airways, Japan Airlines or Finnair. The service on board is also horrible. The crew complained a Japanese guy on the flight. Passengers have to request soft drink from crews. They don't walk and serve you. The meal portion is small. I have to say good bye to UA and Star Alliance. They are just hell alliance."
Oct 2019,10,WORST,"I had a personal ban against United for how awful they are for such a long time. On a business trip now and decided after 6 years to try them again since it was last minute and the other fares were much more expensive (again, after years of declining to do so). 6 hour delay, lost my bag, employees are basically useless. Worst airline ever. I’d rather drive cross country than give them business again 😂"
Oct 2019,40,Falling from Great,"It used to be one of the best airlines, but things have changed. The seating space is much smaller and I’m not that big, paying for extra for everything is getting old. Good thing is you still get a free soda and a cookie, but don’t expect anything more."
Oct 2019,40,"7 hours in-flight from Wash. Dulles to Frankfort Sept. 10/11, 2019","This was a full flight across the Atlantic. But, the attendants did a nice job and ready refilled my wine. The problem with this direction is leave the USA at about 5 pm and arriving Europe at about 7 am the next day.    Our seats were in the center section, not alot of legroom, but not bad.    Through all these time zone changes and flight duration the experience was not bad.  We arrived basically on time and no issue getting our connecting flight from Frankfort to Spain"
Oct 2019,40,Excellent Customer & In flight services .,"We travelled in this flight UA 1602 from SFO to PHL , as a family trip at 10.10pm.  The check In baggages are charged @25$ per baggage & there is a cancellation charges even for preponderance or postponed trips.  The flight arrived well before scheduled time.  In Flight complimentary snacks & drinks are very nice & the service rendered is also excellent .  The leg space is also sufficient & more in Economy class..  Except for the charging of Check in Luggage , we will recommend this flight to every one."
Oct 2019,10,Your airline credit is $3 dollars,"Had a last minute change to a quick flight from San Francisco to Sacramento. The friendly folks at United will be happy to make that change for a ""non-negotiable"" $200 fee. On a ticket that cost $203.00 total. Garbage airline. I will keep the credit just to remind me never to fly them again."
Oct 2019,10,SAME LEVEL AS UPS AND FEDEX,"I have flown in economy class before in other airlines and there's no comparison to United Airlines. I feel that passengers have to pay way more to have a ""decent"" service in order to fly somewhat ""comfortable""  Ive been trying to avoid flying with UA. Unfortunately I let my partner purchase our tickets without realizing that our way back home was through UA. That was a immediately turn off, because I knew what was going to be like.  The craft was in terrible conditions. The seats were disgusting, the tray was dirty and old. Even the ""TV entertainment"" looked hideous.  Flight attendants were despicable, mediocre and rude. I don't understand why UA have elderly flight attendants. They seem to hate their job and you can tell they are drain from dealing with customers, although that's not even an excuse to treat everyone so poorly.  I flew from Brussels, Belgium to Chicago O'hare approximately a 9 hour flight. Unfortunately my seat didn't lean back and I was already feeling disturb and irritable because I knew that if I was to ask any of this worthless flight attendants they were simply wouldn't help me or they couldn't do anything because it was ""out of their hands""  As a passenger I felt like a peasant in ""economy"" this flight attendants are something else.  I have flown in major airlines. On my way to South Africa we flew economy in Swiss Air and we felt like kings. Unlimited drinks, ""real"" silverwares, amazing food, flight attendants were impeccable. UNLIKE UA they served with plastic utensils and disgusting plastic cups they purchase from the DOLLAR TREE. (DO THEY GIVE YOU THE WHOLE CAN OF SOFT DRINK? HECKKKK NOOO. AIR NAMIBIA. who the heck knows about this country/airline? Simply luxuruous and also impeccable. NOTHING to be jealous of UA.  UA is literally in the same category as UPS and FEDEX passengers flies with the boxes.  I sent a complained to UA and the replied saying that they were ""terribly sorry"" and that they were going to give us a $150 voucher to fly with them in our next destination.  I simply want to say that they can put that $150 were the sun doesn't shine. I WILL NEVER EVER SPENT A SINGLE PENNY WITH UA.  THIS AIRLINE NEEDS TO DISAPPEAR"
Oct 2019,30,What happened to happy flight attendants?,I actually have several upcoming flights and not one of them did I book with United. Even if they had the best fare. The unfriendliness of the flight attendants was such that I had never seen before. Even when they were doing the drink service they acted like it was such a chore. The plane was clean and the take off an landing were great. It's sad that it would have been a wonderful flight with as little effort as just a smile.
Oct 2019,40,Surprisingly on time,"Lately, we have had terrible experiences with United - late departures and mechanical issues on half of the flights with them. This flight actually left on time and arrived early!"
Oct 2019,50,Relax in the sky,"I am a 1K, 2,600,000 mile flyer on United. This flight was very comfortable with good food and beverages, and a large variety of movies & TV. The flight attendants were very nice."
Oct 2019,30,Flight From Hell,"Coming home from Vegas. Flight from Vegas, To Denver, To Cedar Rapids, IA. (Night Flight)  After leaving Denver, pilot said maybe a little turbulence in about 12 minutes. Hit some turbulence and it stopped and pilot said should be good rest of way. About 10 minutes later, the plane dropped FAST AND HARD... papers, cell phones etc. floating in the air for about 5 to 10 seconds. Peoples hair in the air. Thank goodness everybody was buckled in. We hit zero gravity. Thought that was the end for all of us. I've flown many, many times and never dropped like that before. Thought the wings were going to snap off or something. Had an hour to go and rest of flight was very rough and we worried it was going to happen again. Very, very scared and I don't get scared. Was so bad me and wife kept looking at each other and asking if the kids had the wills and what would happen if we go down and disintegrate. That's how bad it was. Now I don't know if I want to fly again.  In fairness, the pilot did come on the radio and apologize, and both pilots came out of the cockpit when we landed and pulled up to the gate to apologize and say goodbye. Glad that's over!!!"
Oct 2019,50,Good flight - reasonable cost,"Economy flight was on time. Even with the ""Basic"" economy fare, I was offered soft drinks and cookies or pretzels. The flight attendents were very pleasant and overall it was a good flight."
Oct 2019,40,"Long flights, nonstop, 767-400ER, food sucks","I used to fly a lot, a really lot, but now retired. The only way to get to Italy is by plane, so, bit the bullet and bought a cheap ticket. The planes were on time (mostly) and crowded (completely). The seats (last seats in the plane) were not the worst. Just enough knee room not to cram my knees into the seat in front of me. Power plug did not work, entertainment was adequate to fill the time. Food was disgusting, could not eat anything except the rolls and butter."
Oct 2019,10,Never Flying With Them Again,"I made the mistake of booking a long distance flight with United, instead of the much better international carriers I normally go through. With every new fleet, the seats get smaller, recline less, and are crowded closer together. The service was abysmal, their staff looked exhausted and overworked, the meals were horrendous, and the level of comfort was literally zero. This seems to be a theme with US based airlines who are more concerned with keeping their stockholders happy at the expense of the paying customer. My advice, stay far away from United and other US based airlines when you can get much better quality with carriers like Hong Kong Air for literally the same price."
Oct 2019,50,Quick and convenient,"The flight was quick and even arrived early! The Redmond Oregon is compact, serviced by several airlines and car rental firms. Every detail was right at the terminal so it made for brief walking and was very convenient.  As is the case in these smaller airports, luggage pickup was also prompt and easy."
Oct 2019,30,Domestic USA still in need of mood modifier,"As a million mile flyer I always consider United when traveling. Regretfully, they are often too expensive for the destinations I'm looking at both domestic and international. On this occasion I was doing 7 flights in 48 hours so it made sense to consolidate into one ticket and United was my first choice and it worked out. However, the portion of the trip from Newark to Ft. Lauderdale found me with those grumpy crew members we all love to hate. Just everything seemed complicated for them, poor overall impression and just those employees who didn't care to be there to do their job. It was all too mechanical for me. To be fair, I flew to Houston and then Chicago where I had exceptional service, especially on the B777 going to ORD. So, it just appears to be more pot luck on domestic flight where UA just can't get the consistency."
Oct 2019,50,Actually no problem going to Anchorage,"Had a beautiful trip out. Flew from Cedar Rapids to Denver then straight to Anchorage. No problems. Flight crew was tip top. Denver to Anchorage, flight attendant Marcia was the most attentive staff personnel I have ever met. Wow what an asset to United. I do have a picture of her. Wished I could find a way to show you who she is. Again she was wonderful"
Oct 2019,30,Starting to miss the mark,"I have been loyal to the brand for years. I have to say that the past year every aspect of flying this brand is challenging. Forget the delays, that’s not in their control. However the planes are not very clean, especially if there was a flight before yours. The flight attendants - some not all - have attitudes. I get the stress side for them dealing with the public, but hey it’s your job. Anyway, United - step it up !"
Oct 2019,10,United getting worst by the day!!,"In the last 90 days I have been forced to use United for my traveling. I gotta say I am so disappointed to see where this company and its customer service is heading. They are purposely making sure that families that purchase basic economic aren’t sitting together, that way they can charge their extras fees to people that want to sit by their families. I. My most recent trip there were three couples including me and my wife, United made sure all couples were split one couple even were separes with me siting in the middle sit and my wife on the row next to us. How stupid is this United, get it together!! I paid for basic economy with Delta and they had no problem sitting me next to my wife. Then when I try to talk to anyone on customer service at the airport or over the phone, all I get is rude comments and one even laugh in my face for not been willing to pay more"
Oct 2019,30,New Polaris configuration 777-200,"So United change our aircraft to their newly configured Polaris product. I would have given them a higher rating but compared to others they have room for improvement, especially when you're traveling business class. Positives: New seats are nice and is more consistent with Star Alliance Members, nice amenity kit, and comfortable. Negatives: The meals were not as good as American or ANA. They need more flight attendants, EVA Air had an army of attendants. This caused the food service to be slow and you could tell the flight crew was overwhelmed, and over worked."
Oct 2019,10,Worse customer service airline,"United offers basic economy tickets as a hook, but make it impossible for you to travel and not feel like a cheap flyer. I'm a weekly flyer and because I travel alone with no bags, I choose basic economy. First they force you to go to the terminal at least 1 to 1:30 before your flight to get your ticket, you can't check in online with the app unless you have bags. Then, after I arrive to Houston, I realize they had a flight departing two hours before my flight with empty seats, but again, their policies doesn't allow to provide accommodations for basic economy at no cost to the company. They rather leave empty seats, rather than allowing a passanger to use the stand by. Buyers be aware, they will make everything possible to create discomfort in your flight. That is not how you take care of your customers. Not flying again with them. American makes all this possible even with their basic economy."
Oct 2019,50,Flights were all on time,Direct flight is the way to go. Flight was on time. Easy getting around SFO airport. Airbus was great for our car rental. Recommend using Hertz for car rental. Very east return of car. We drove in and were able to leave keys in vehicle.
Oct 2019,40,Remember flight delays are foryour saftey,Returning to ord from sfo turned into a 3 hr delay. First 2 hrs on the plane then got off the plane for an hour. Lucky I used my united lounge pass and was sitting sweat with everything I needed. Finally fixed the problem (generator) and took off. I was a little frustrated and then remembered fixing problems is for my safety. Take a deep breath and know your safe when u take off. Pilot was good about info and was as pro as u want your pilot to be.
Oct 2019,30,Just So Tight,"Economy is getting smaller and smaller. Especially when the girl next to you sits crossed leg and snuggles you for half the flight! The food is what it is. The service is probably the best United will ever do, a little bit above OK. We had to fly back through Munich so they heavily penalized our fares. Round trip to either Zurich or Munich was about $600, we paid $1400 each. that never feels good."
Oct 2019,20,Not a great flight experience,"3.5 hrs flight from Houston (IAH) to Ontario, California via. United Airlines was not so great. Flight got delayed as one of the cabin crew did not arrive on time. Overall facilities during the duration of the flight were not so good. Seating was not comfortable. Cabin crew does not seem to care about the passengers travelling. Overall not a pleasant experience. Thank you."
Oct 2019,40,Coming Home with comfort & ease,"After disappointing and uncomfortable Lufthansa flights from Europe, we were happy to settle in on our comfortable and spacious seats for a quick and uneventful flight home.  Nowadays I guess it bears mentioning when a domestic flight goes off without a hitch, especially when you have jet lag and want to get home."
Oct 2019,40,United Airlines,Our round trip flights went absolutely smoothly. Both flights left on time and arrived earlier than expected. Love United because it has a hub Newark International Airport (EWR) which means a multitude of non-stops available at all times. Check-in was quick and easy with the multitude of kiosks available in the airports.
Oct 2019,20,They let an obese guy use twenty percent of my seat!,Why they let obese passengers fly in regular width seats is inexcusable.... I paid for a full width seat a got a sweaty shoulder and arm moving me to avoid him.... not fair!
Oct 2019,10,Awful experience,"We bought premium economy without realizing that the seats aren’t reclinable. We requested special meals and verified numerous times. When our dinner was served, no special meals were available."
Oct 2019,30,Slim seating,There is nothing special about flying United. The seats are so small that my knees touch the seat in front. Flying that way for several hours is beyond uncomfortable. I wasn't able to stretch out my legs and ended up with swelling in my ankles the entire trip.
Oct 2019,20,Moved seats with equipment change,We bought premium economy seats 20j&k. Upon online check-in we discovered we were put in seats 49a and 20f. We had to swap once on the plane with others who had the same plight and ended up in seats 32 D&E. Not what we paid for and no recourse offered by United. It sucked on such a long flight. They just didn't care what they did to everyone. What a mess.
Oct 2019,20,Bare Bones Flying Bus,Pros: I got a last minute regular economy flight for less than other airlines were charging.    The snacks were tasty.    Cons: There was no charging station even though the sticker said there was.    The in-flight entertainment either didn't work or was so user-unfriendly that it might as well have not worked. Unacceptable for a cross country flight.    This isn't the first time I've had these issues with this airline.
Oct 2019,30,Not very bright,"We knew the last leg of our trip home wouldn’t happen because of weather delays, which is no ones fault. But early in the day we tried to rebook the earliest next day flight and they refused to give us that option. The customer service agent told us to just hope for the best and rebook once we “for sure” missed our flight. So we were rebooked automatically onto the very latest flight the next day, leaving us stranded in Denver for 28 hours."
Oct 2019,40,on Time flights!,"Was a pleasure to finally fly for the first time in many years on any airline that was on time going and returning. This flight also stopped in Denver both ways, which was a very nice airport to get around and had variety of food choices. Also the United stewards and stewardesses were ver nice and accommodating."
Oct 2019,50,"A hop, skip and jump",After a very very long direct flight on a very large craft from TLV to SFO we boarded this tiny aircraft for a commuter run to little Bob Hope Airport.  What a joy this was. Short and to the point with very nice staff on board. Also no hassles with our bags being taken from us aft  er customs and sent on to our connecting flight. Cudoes to United.  The only fly in the ointment was a king line for security check between short connecting flights. A silly hassle. Where would a passenger get anything dangerous between planes?
Oct 2019,40,On time and smooth,"Quick flight to DEN to catch a Lufthansa flight to Germany. No issues, competent crew, clean plane, comfortable for a short flight"
Oct 2019,10,Ms.,"Seating was horrible!!! Service was horrible, arrived from connecting flight had only 11 minutes to get to next flight running for 11 to get from one gate to another and only to be seated in the very back last seats on the air plane. Seats very small and tight. No room at all."
Oct 2019,40,A long haul with a sour end,"The ground service in TLV was good and helpful. The staff on board was courteous and generally efficient. However, towards the end of a 14 plus hour non-stop flight there were 2 flies in the ointment:  1. breakfast was served about an hour before touch down. However for those of us in the back of the plane there wasn't enough time to serve coffee so they didn't. And this despite the 40 minutes that passengers had to wait in the plane after landing before US customs opened the airport.... On the ground we had another flight to make and barely had time to buy a cuppa to take onto the next flight. Hey, guys. Get it together to avoid this again.  2. We were told conflicting information about forms that needed to be filled out. So I ignored one staff member who refused to give me the form and filled out the form another staff member gave me just to be safe. On the ground passport control took the form. So who knows what was really right here?  All in all a good flight on a good airline."
Oct 2019,30,Is United Premium Economy worth the extra money??,"We got upgraded to Polaris on the way over to Paris so that part of the trip was great. We paid for and flew Premium Plus on the way back and that was a little bit of a letdown. It's not that the United Premium Economy is that bad; it is just that it didn't measure up to the better airlines' premium economy. If you have flown Air New Zealand or Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airline premium economy, you expect much better service than the regular economy. In United's case, besides bigger seats, premium economy didn't offer much. Yes, the food was a little better than economy, but it definitely wasn't premium. And they pour the same generic wine as in regular economy. Besides, there was no extra service at all; not even a wet hand towel. One wonders how United can be charging so much more money for these seats."
Oct 2019,20,Lacks proper comfort,"This was a 5 hour flight and I was not a comfortable passenger. The sits are narrow, not enough leg room, little air flow from above, and no viewing monitor on the backs of the seats. Unless you had your own device with preloaded movies, there was no real way to watch one during the flight. United suggest that we connect to their app while on broad to watch a movie, but during this flight it did not work. This made for a long flight to LA."
Oct 2019,50,A great experience!,"I had not flown in years and was very nervous to do so. When boarding the plane in San Antonio, Texas, the flight attendant was told by my brother that I was not a fan of flying. During the trip, she came by several times and asked if I was ok and if I needed anything, even suggesting I sit across the aisle where all the seats were vacant so I could stretch out and relax. I declined but was so impressed by her thoughtfulness. The other flights were great, good customer service and I would definitely choose United Airlines in the future!"
Oct 2019,40,Excellent service for the price paid,"Both flights kept to schedule. Very efficient boarding at both airports, getting everyone sat & carry-on bags stowed without fuss even though the first flight was full. Cabin crew efficient and pleasant. Meals were reasonable, including the vegan (to our pleasant surprise). Good entertainment system to keep us occupied during the flights. The seats were not the most comfortable, leg room OK & we were at the back of the plane so last to immigration and bag collection, but to be expected as we were travelling economy."
Oct 2019,40,UAL 160 MUC-IAH,"Arrived at Munich 3 hours early, for mid-morning departure. Check-in staff was a mix of UAL and Lufthansa personnel. I noticed the line hadn't been moving for at least 20 minutes, several trans-con flights departing same time period. After 30 minutes, we were advised that the computers were down, hoped to be back up shortly. Overall, it was an hour to check-in.  Passport control had faulty readers, over 2/3 of people attempting to use had to go to lines for personal attention. Security checkpoint was very efficient. Also had secondary security approaching the gate area, I was waived through.  Gate area: UAL has the end of the concourse for departures. While roomy and spacious, it was very hot for mid-morning in September. No water fountains or bottle fill points after completing the secondary checkpoint. Had to buy bottled water at 2.50 euro each!  Boarding was a little slow for this flight. Push-back was on time, plane was approx 80% full, 767-300, 2-3-2 seating. I had tried several times to re-select seats further back on our side of the plane, but kept getting rejected, even though it showed them as empty. Once on the plane, determined they were blocked out for crew rest.  11+ hour flight, all daylight. Seat back entertainment was the same as the B777 we flew over, finished watching my TV series. Lunch was served about an hour after departure. Same crappy grain salad, the chicken dish was alright.  Afternoon snack about 90 minutes before landing was warm ham and cheese sandwich, which I thought was really good. Two of those for the main meal, and you can keep the stupid salad....  Probably because this was a daylight flight, we saw the flight staff quite a bit more. Had someone walking down the aisle handing out water bottles at least every 60-90 minutes the whole flight. Seats definitely not made for 10+ hours for straight sitting. Luckily with the plane quiet and fairly empty towards the rear, I was able to move around when needed.  Overall, a very good flight. Just the uinitial issues at Munich as noted. Bad weather at Houston, but the flight deck handled it just fine, minimal turbulence."
Oct 2019,10,United sucks,This air line is late First of all and then on our connecting flight split up my son and my wife and put us on different planes totally ... I’m not flying this air line ever again ... I went to customer service and they said hay your going to la so ..... what the hell does that mean I’m goin to la .... worst experience ever
Oct 2019,50,Family emergency,"I had to return only 2 days after arrival. I used ,70,000 miles on an economy flight to fly to Bangkok. I was disappointed that at such short notice to return ( cancelling my original return that was several weeks later) I have to use another 30,000 because only seats available was in business class. However, it was excellent sith booths that enabled one to lie down and the food was so superior to economy with free travel packs too.  I wish United would have given me the 30,000 miles back as I had documentation from the nurse. I can't afford business class normally. It it was very good and restful and I crossed the world 2 times in 5 days and was do stressed by the emergency. Unfortunately I don't have enough miles for respite now."
Oct 2019,10,Tony,The worst airline you do not want to travel on As bad as American airline I thought it was better but not when it comes to class JetBlue is the best no Compare
Oct 2019,50,Flight to Rome,We had an Excellent smooth flight. Staff was friendly and attentive. Would recommend united airlines
Oct 2019,50,Mechanical Delay in Edinburgh- Missed Flight at Dulles but United handled it well,Our travel day started out really well-- we had a delightful check-in experience including a story about a 95 year old passenger that didn't know her son's address and the clerk went to great lengths to track the correct address down. Excellent customer service.    Onboarding experience went well and it looked like we might take off early but a pesky oil light in the cockpit held us back an hour. We finally took off and the flight experience was as expected-- nothing unusual although they did seem to be filling our wine glasses a little more freely than previous flights.    As we approached our landing the flight crew explained that some of us might miss our connections due to the mechanical delay but while we were in the air United had re-booked us on the next available flight and more surprisingly that if we were somehow able to get to our gate on-time we could board the earlier flight.    I had given us a 90 minute cushion when I booked our return flights but an hour of that was eaten up with the delay and I was pretty sure the remaining 30 minutes would disappear in customs. I could see from my United APP that we were booked on a flight in 3 hours so we decided not to stress ourselves and if we managed to get to the gate that would be great-- United had staff at the baggage area instructing us on how to move our luggage to the correct drop-off point and that we did not need to have it re-routed they had taken care of that-- several of the travelers were in a high stress mode and we just reminded ourselves that if we missed our first flight we were headed home and landing at midnight was not that big of deal. (I'm sure we would have been more concerned if we were at the beginning of our travels.)    We did not make our original flight but enjoyed drinks and snacks in the United Club and were very satisfied at how seamlessly they had re-routed us and provided excellent updates on how to manage this change. We use United for most of our flights mainly because we live in a hub city but over the last couple of years we've been pleased by their improved customer service and on-time schedules.
Oct 2019,30,Just Another So So Airline,"There wasn't anything particularly good or bad about these flights. The food was typical, less than apetizing airline food, the crew was ok, comfort was poor, and the entertainment was limited."
Oct 2019,30,United to Isreal,"OK, but not as good as other international carriers. A fair meal then lights out. No service till a very light breakfast. Typical but on other carriers crew at least come through for those who don’t sleep on airplanes. Again seating was OK but not as nice as foreign carriers."
Oct 2019,20,United at best is OK,"One would expect courteous service in business class (after all it costs a lot of money). While the comfort of business class is great, the on-board staff is usually border-line OK. While they address you as Mr. <Last Name>, but, they are very mechanical in doing their duties. I am always afraid of saying anything jokingly as their gestures are very unwelcoming. They do not give you a warm and fuzzy feeling, they do not make you feel that you are ""really welcomed"", even though they will say welcome aboard - very cold, very mechanical, very non-personal. They make you feel that they are serving you because they have to - not because they like to (or enjoy doing so).  I have taken 10's (if not 100's) flights with them (stuck because of mileage plan), and have always paid cash (no mileage upgrades), but, I have always observed this behaviour within RECENT YEARS. In the past, they were great."
Oct 2019,40,On time and good,"All four flights were on time and the service was good. With two changes...no problems with the luggage, either."
Oct 2019,20,about the worst food ever,"attendant lacking in any personality, served lunch then would take a drink order so nothing to drink with snack. snack was the pits three petite chicken slices, cold corn soggy and tasteless and a small candy bar. I guess was not heated enough but tasteless anyway."
Oct 2019,40,A+ In a.crisis,"United airlines reacted promptly, efficiently and with compassion when we found ourselves, as tourists, in the middle of a civil uprising in Ecuador. They really saved us from even more anxiety by changing our tickets without question and helping us exit the country. We are most appreciative. Kudos!"
Oct 2019,20,dusty not clean,"I like united but seat always dirty very good price ,I have book business class to India n tht is also dust around seat i have complain but no reaponce yet ,Even local flight is dirty very good space between seat"
Oct 2019,30,UAL 340 ORD-IAD,"Second of three flights for the long day, OMA-ORD-IAD-MUC. United changed the flights on me, about a month ago; was supposed to fly OMA-IAD direct originally.  O'Hare; love the terminal, but the people.....  Terminal: the architecture and high windows of the UAL side are beautiful to me. However, it is old and getting cramped. Not enough seats in any area for the flights. Boarding lines extend and cross in the main hall. Maybe get someone in to remove ""some"" of the birds??? The better restaurants are a long walk away, outside of United's area. And most windows are not conducive to plane watching.  B737, either -8 or -9 for the flight. Window seat behind the wing. Leg room was definitely tightest of all the flights on this trip.  Why is Chicago staff so surly? No smiles at the gate, same on the plane. Snack service felt like it was done grudgingly. If it wasn't a ORD based flight crew, they were definitely looking for a transfer.  Landing was a few minutes early. Not much info provided regarding connecting flights by the crew."
Oct 2019,40,UAL 106 IAD-MUC 9/11/19,"This was third leg of outbound trip. Boeing 777-200, flight was approx 75% full, so room to stretch out a bit. I had not flown United for about 10 years, first international flight with them.  Flight experienced about an hour delay in boarding due to ""weather event"" at IAD. Radar showed storms moving through to the south, but nothing was visible within 5 miles of the airport. Tarmac was never wetted down, so unsure of the reason for this at the busy evening rush time.  When loading started, it progressed at a fairly rapid pace. United appears to have changed loading based on seat assignment, which makes sense, ie: load window seat first, then middle, then aisle. We loaded fairly early, as were in the back of the plane. Changed seat assignment approx 3 days out to the paired seats that are in the rear of the B777 aircraft. Works nice for us as a couple.  Seats were typical economy. Legroom was normal, actually felt like I had more than the 737-8 that brought me to iAD.  Taxi and departure were non-events. Departed via Rwy 30, which allowed us to get altitude and swing out over the arriving traffic in the metroplex. We were over water in southern NJ. Due to the ground delay, sunset hit prior to hitting Long Island.  Dinner service was alright. Why do they keep insisting on serving that cold barley salad thing? very sour yet tasteless. Never saw anyone eat theirs around us. Drink service was very good.  Breakfast in the morning was yogurt and fruit, neither of which I like, so I ate the pretzels I saved from my earlier flights. Would be nice to have a pastry option or something else for us carnivores. No refills on coffee, which I really needed as I was going to have a full day.  The entertainment system worked flawlessly. Lots of choices for movies, TV, and music. Between the round-trip, I was able to watch a whole TV series.  Flew over London at sunrise, hit the continent and cloud cover until we started the descent into Munich. Landed less than 30 minutes late, so we made up some time.  On the overnight flight, rear of the plane was very quiet, not too many bathroom users and the crew kitchen area wasn't too noisy."
Oct 2019,10,Terrible United Frankfurt staff,"I stopped flying United for years because of its terrible services and staff, and finally got courage to give it a try. What a mistake ! At Frankfurt united counter security check, the security lady barely asked anyone before or after me any questions, but in my turn, she asked everything from my occupation and why I came to Europe, where I have been, who packed my bags, what I have in my bags. So I asked her the reasons why only me (during my session, 5 other non-minority people have passed the other lady’s check with barely 2 questions asked. Before me, she passed everyone in barely 30 seconds as well. Everything in common was those people were not minority like me). She got mad and she started writing down stuff on my ticket and while I was getting my boarding pass, she went to the ticket lady to give a signal. Yes, I was in trouble. I had to go through special check with the armed police (asked for reasons and the nice German security lady said a special alarm flag tagged on me. The little old me, middle aged 95lb Asian lady)  I have nothing else to say about United."
Oct 2019,40,My constant travel carrier,"United is my constant and go to travel carrier. I have always had good service with them and they maintain a timely schedule, easy to maneuver if switching planes say in Denver."
Oct 2019,10,Terrible handling of the SFO runway situation,"We arrived in Vancouver 11 hours later than our original schedule, Sept 12. 11 hours. We arrived at 2:30 AM Sept 13. First, United offered us a schedule with a 40-minute connection in Chicago, arriving in Vancouver at 3:30 PM. OK, my fault for taking that schedule. The flight from GSP to O’Hare was 20 minutes late, so we knew we would miss our connection. The agent at GSP re-booked us GSP-Newark-SFO-Vancouver, arriving about 6 PM. United’s fault for booking that! There was a runway under construction at SFO, resulting in delays of over 5 hours. Ultimately, we took a flight out of Newark that was scheduled for 12:30 PM and left at 5:30 PM. Newark had flights to SFO every hour, did not cancel them but let them go many hours behind schedule. From SFO, our flight to Vancouver also had a multi-hour delay. So we didn’t miss it, but we arrived at Vancouver at 2:30 AM. United had plenty of notice of the construction at SFO—we read about it in the SF paper. But they did not adjust their schedule to anything realistic, just took customers’ money for flights that had no chance of being close to on-time. An awful experience that left us hating United."
Oct 2019,50,Flights just flew in.,"Three flights to get from San Diego to Cancun via San Francisco and Houston. All flights departed on time and arrived ahead of time. Flight officer on all flights kept the passengers informed of arrival time and current weather conditions. Food and drinks on all flights were good, glass was never empty for long till flight attendent asked if I wanted a refill.  All in all excellent flights."
Oct 2019,20,Never again,"First of all we were delayed. We were waiting for a connecting flight, I understand that, however after those people arrived, there was suddenly an issue with the bathrooms. If that were truly the case, why wasn’t it taken care of while we were waiting for the connecting flight? Also there are no TVs on the plane & the flight attendants were not too friendly. I will never fly United again."
Oct 2019,10,Be careful,"Be carefully on packing for your carry on. You can only pack clothes & shoes. They will try to throw away all your personal items. Including perfume, hairspray, facials cleaners and lotion, shampoo & conditioner & anything else they can find to throw away"
Oct 2019,40,One of the friendliest service I’ve received on an airline!,"I booked my return flights on United airlines about 4 months ago without having read google reviews. I must admit, I was shocked by some of the rather scathing reviews and wondered what I’d gotten myself into!  So I went expecting very little, however the service I recieved on a 14.5 hour return flight each way was nothing short of exemplary! The friendliest flight crew, very regular trash/ rubbish collection, great food and drink options and satisfactory seats.  The only thing that would make it really great are things like dimmed back screen lights for neighbouring passengers so if a person is trying to sleep, the light from the next persons screen doesnt shine in your face, hooks and cup holders at the back of the seats would also make long haul flights more comfy.  Other than that, I really couldn’t fault it and I’d definitely be flying United again!"
Oct 2019,10,Paying $30 for a carry on in order to receive Boarding Pass - even though not bringing a carry on,"I am being required to pay $30 to receive my boarding pass online and ahead of my flight, because I'm not opting to bring anything other than a personal item on the flight. To avoid the fee, I can get to the airport earlier to wait in line to Confirm that I'm not bringing an additional item on board (other than my personal item) and then receive my boarding pass... eliminating the purpose of checking-in online.    I am a frequent flyer, but not tied to a specific airline. I will not be flying United again. Haven't had this issue with any other provider."
Oct 2019,10,Terrible airline,I fly 20-25 times a year and United is by far my least favorite airline. Despite plenty of overhead bin space they start making economy and economy plus passenger start checking bags too early in the boarding process. They don’t care about passengers whatsoever.
Oct 2019,10,Stuck over night at Newark,United cancel my flight is was unable to book a flight for me that day out of Newark after waiting hours for the status if the aircraft. In all that time 4 to 5 flights were going back to LOS ANGELES that afternoon and night and all were full. They did not take my luggage off the plane and sent it ahead to Los Angeles thus we had no luggage. Now we are stuck in Newark airport overnight with a 20 voucher. Gee United you are so cheap.    Never Never again. United Sucks!!!!
Oct 2019,20,Unfriendly Stewardess,"Seats are hard and stewardess unfriendly . On a 4 hour flight my husband need to stand. This was not allowed. Yes, there was a bit of turbulence, but not when he was standing."
Oct 2019,50,Treated Very Kindly,We had full flights from Medford to Denver and Denver to Houston and back again. I have trouble walking long distances so I noted that when buying my tickets on line. United had a wheelchair waiting for me at all my connecting flights. It was an awesome experience! I was treated very kindly and made it to all my connections without feeling like I was going to have a physical collapse getting there.
Oct 2019,50,Premium Economy was worth it!,We flew to Frankfurt to connect to Basal for our Viking cruise. We flew on a newer plane and premium economy was worth extra $ . The extra leg room alone is worth it. But the level of service was great. We had no complaints about service. Having never had to connect to another flight in Europe it would have been very helpful for crew to share information on what/ how to handle passport clearance. Frankfurt airport is HUGE and there is no signage to direct you.
Oct 2019,20,"Lost ,misplaced and late luggage","Flights the previous day had been cancelled x 3 ,booked on morning flight next day ,had checked in baggage for first flight,went to collect back was told oh sorry it’s been loaded and sent off ,arrived in Orlando late the next day to find that my suitcase had been lost and another suitcase had my luggage tags on it, customer service very banal ,stated you will have to fill out paperwork and we will try to get it to you.  Finally got an email my suitcase had been located and was being driven to me ,"
Oct 2019,50,Very nice ride,"Very comfortable and lovely seating, good privacy for yourself, very good ride for long time flight over seas"
Oct 2019,20,Having your flight itinerary cancelled is never a fun experience!,"There are many reasons (some contrived by revenue maximization policies) for Unite to cancel the outbound leg of a 2 flight itinerary that would have brought us home comfortably. Regardless of the ""real"" reason for canceling UA2287 on October 28th, our involuntary rebooking to the rear of the plane economy seats (UA 1929) was appalling. To make matters worse, we are still awaiting a refund of the difference in fares between 1st class and ""cattle"" class!"
Oct 2019,20,Rude Flight Attendant,"The flight was full. The flight attendant was a bit abrupt and rude. No pleasant. We will avoid flying with SkyWest Airlines dba United Express again, if possible. There must be alternative carriers where the staff are more pleasant."
Oct 2019,50,On Time and safe,This is a small commuter airline. The seats are crowded but the flight was early and safe. nd the luggage was delivered quickly.
Oct 2019,20,"Good flights, poor customer service","United is generally a ""just fine"" experience for me. On this particular trip, the flights were fine — a standard economy experience. What stood out to me was customer service by united employees in both Boston and Norfolk.    The check-in and baggage drop in Boston was a particularly frustrating experience due to the lack of organization and teamwork between the employees. We were given conflicting direction from employees who sent us back and forth between the line to start our baggage drop and a kiosk (which was the only option for accomplishing this task). The confusion and frustration was clearly not unique to myself and my companion.    In Norfolk, a united employee unenthusiastically helped us to find an alternate flight, when we realized that our flight was delayed, and that we would almost certainly miss our connecting flight which would have landed us stuck in Newark overnight. He found us an alternate route after we persistently asked for other options that would get us back to Boston that night.    I generally fly United because of convenience and price. With United, you generally get what you pay for."
Oct 2019,30,"3.5 star experience, better than expected","We caught a sale ticket for Light Fare Economy from NY to Madrid. It only includes 1 carryon and 1 personal item but that was fine for us for the price. Cost $60 if you wanted a checked bag and you could only pay for it at the airport. A little pricey but considering the sale, I guess that was fine. Couldn't check in online either. Wish at least we could pick our seats, but couldn't until we checked in at their airport.    Flight itself was pretty good, better than I expected. Good staff, good service, good legroom, food much better than I expected and icecream too. Plane was decent and clean.    Only thing I didn't like was that there were no screens to watch movies on. I wish we knew ahead of time so we could prepare. Apparently, you could download the United.com app and through there you could select a movie and watch it on your tablet or phone. Before takeoff, the flight attendant mentioned at the last minute we could use their wifi to download but were were not successful in getting it to work after we tried many things. Ended up with 7 hours of nothing to watch."
Oct 2019,10,Wow,"Flight got delayed resulting in a missed connection through off vacation plans...went to sit in the United Club room and was greated with a “get out of here”...delay is bad enough, but is what it is...the lack of customer service is unacceptable.    Shoulda booked delta"
Oct 2019,40,"nO CONNECTIONS MISSED, NO LUGGAGE LOST","We had connecting flights through Newark. We made all our connections with no problem. Our flight from Newark to Lima was delayed by about an hour because the plane was in was late. No real problem, professionally handled."
Oct 2019,40,Pleasant surprise,"After finding out that no business class lounge exists for customers my expectations for the in flight experience were low. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Seats were well structured and generously sized. Entertainment screen is large and content good. Inflight catering was also good. My best US airline inflight experience."
Oct 2019,50,Another Try,"I hadn’t flown United previously Continental Airlines out of IAH since the mid 80’s when I flew flight 911 that took 4 airplanes and 12 hours to get to LAX. I was pleased with the direct service to NRT had to switch planes prior to departure due to mechanical, but was provided a $20 food voucher and $150 voucher for my next flight for the inconvenience, but glad we did for obvious reasons. Transferred to ANA airlines into BKK. I will fly United again they have improved their standard of services."
Oct 2019,30,United Airlines Economy,"This flight was listed as a Lufthansa flight, but it was a United Airlines plane and United employees. The plane was clean and efficiently and safely operated. The listed flight times were almost correct. The flight attendants were plentiful, but seemed to be in-training since some of them didn't know what to do. The food service was something less than satisfactory, but not awful. My issue has to do with the difficulty of on-line check-in and not knowing my seat numbers even though I had paid for reserved seats. Flyers should understand that this flight was 'a la carte' in that an extra was charged for almost everything. There were extra fees for seating, luggage, special food - and for other things I didn't need. No discount, however, for the frustration of on-line check-in laced with unclear terms and conflicting information. United got to Holland and back e safely, but I found little joy in the almost 9 hour flight"
Oct 2019,40,Small but comfortable,"My main reason for choosing the flight I did was price. I needed a ticket right away and for as cheap as I could get. There was not very much room on the plane, but the staff was welcoming and accomidated many people trying to make it as comfortable as possible. The first flight was pretty nice, I had the isle seat and was in the back of the plane. My second flight I sat in the middle between two larger gentlemen and that was a bit too tight. But seeing as I wanted a cheap flight I got what I paid for. So, regardless of my seating arrangments the flight attendants were very nice and made sure we were all as comfortable as we possibly could be. Overall good experience. However next time, I believe I will be paying to choose my own seat for more comfort."
Oct 2019,30,Delayed from Hawaii to SFO,"About an hour and a half to two hours into the flight from Lihue H to SFO, the pilot informed us there was a navigation system problem. That required we turn back to Hawaii and fly into Honolulu airport, where United Airlines maintenance group resides. We then had to board a new plane, delaying our flight by 2+ hours. We arrived into SFO after midnight, so a taxi was required to get us to our hotel. The next day we took a shuttle to the airport, the a separate shuttle Advantage Rental Car - off airport. I had to speak to a manager to get a ""Rav4 or like car."" We will NEVER deal with Advantage again. All in all, with delays aside, our Hawaii trip was wonderful."
Oct 2019,50,Short Enjoyable Flight,"We flew to Savannah from Chicago and back, and it was a nice, short, enjoyable flight. The plane was smaller than we’re used to, and it was clean, the flight attendants were friendly and hospitable, and the ride and landing were smooth. All in all, a very good experience."
Oct 2019,40,"Good service, cramped seating",The flight left late due to poor weather for the incoming flight but the airline ensured the details were communicated and kept eveyone up to date with changes. Very good service on boarding and on the flight but even though we booked extra legroom on the flight (at significant cost) the pitch was disappointing and uncomfortable. The onboard service was very good and the range of movies and programs was extensive.
Oct 2019,20,"Mechanical issues, a new plane and 3 hours late, entertainment system broken!","This flight was Polaris Class which TA does not list, it is basically an upgraded Business Class as there is no First anymore on United.    We boarded on time and got a pre-flight drink and then they announced there was a mechanical issue and we had to get off with all of our stuff. Sat at the gate for 30 minutes and they had us all go to a new gate. We waited and waited and as is typical, United is really bad about keeping customers informed. They finally gave us all $20 meal vouchers so we went to get something to eat. Just got our food and we get a text that they will board soon so we get our food to go and head back and find that the plane is finally arrived but needs to be cleaned and catered. We wait another 40 minutes and finally get on and the flight takes off 3 hours late. They also gave every passenger a $150 voucher for future travel because the entertainment system was broken! Flight crew was hardly noticable as they tried to get dinner out, We asked for slippers and mattress pads and told them we were skipping dinner as we already ate. Only got the slippers.    Breakfast was an oversalted and over stuffed cheese omelet with potatoes and horrible little chicken sausages that were more like bits of styrofoam. Total crap for food as usual.    This was a $2500 ticket, what a pathetic waste of money!"
Oct 2019,40,"Flight from O'Hare to Columbia, MO","We arrived at O'Hare from Maui at 5:30 am and my flight to Columbia was not until almost 6 pm. My ticket was ""Basic economy"" which means I was only allowed one personal item. No carry-on (unless I wanted to pay $85 to check it). I tried to get my boarding pass at the kiosk, but could not. I went to the counter and the lady helped me get my boarding pass. She asked about my bag and I showed it to her. After getting my boarding pass, I noticed there was no gate number on it, so I went back to the counter. She was helping another person, but there was another lady at the other end. She helped me. She looked at my ticket and said ""Isn't there another flight before this one?' I said that I didn't know, but if there was, I would love to have it. She looked and said there was one leaving at 1:00 and there was one seat left on it. She gave to me. It was on the very front row, very comfortable, and my ticket now said economy. NO problem taking my small tote with my hat, cane, pillow and reading material on along with my personal item. That had been a concern with the ""Basic economy"" ticket I did have. She was so very nice. We had a very nice conversation and she gave me vouchers for breakfast and lunch at the airport and recommended where I should go to pick out a restaurant in the airport. She said she gave them to me because I was so nice and pleasant. I really appreciated all of her help. Even with the earlier flight, I had to change gates 3 times before the flight actually left. I slept all the way to Columbia, MO on the plane, so I can't say much about the service on the flight, but the stewardess was very pleasant."
Oct 2019,40,Non stop over-night flight.,"I do recommend flying non-stop from Hawaii, if one can. Over-night is good as you don't leave until late in the day and can sleep on the plane. Checking in was easy at the kiosk, even though I don't like to do it that way. My cousin said we paid for extra leg room, but the ticket said economy. We did not check bags. Everything I had with me fit under the seat in front of me, but it may have been roomier than the normal ""economy"" seat. Service was good, but we had to buy the food and the cheeseburger was below average. There were no screens on the back of the seats, so, unless you have a device with you to download the United app, you cannot watch a movie."
Oct 2019,30,"Changed planes in San Francisco, CA","United does not have a counter that you can get your boarding pass from, so we had to use the Kiosk. I am not comfortable with that, but managed. Since we were flying economy and I had flown to Chicago as Basic economy, we did not have any bags to check. There was plenty of room under the seat in front of me for all of my items that I had with me. The service was very good between Chicago and San Francisco. No food was served. Changed planes in San Francisco. Smooth transition. The ride from San Francisco to Maui was a little like a zoo. United was not at fault. It seemed like half the plane was small children. We were all seated in the back half of the plane and there were lots of empty seats toward the middle of the plane. We were not allowed to move up toward the front unless we wanted to pay an additional $104 for the ""better"" seat. It was explained that all the seats in front of the wing were ""Economy Plus"". The service was okay, but I think the stewardesses were a little ""hairied"" with all the children. They were pretty noisy and some did cry. This is understandable though. The food was pretty good. There was even a screen on the back on the seats so we could watch a movie. On the flight from Chicago to San Francisco, unless you had a device that you could download their app, you couldn't watch a movie. The flight was pretty smooth and the pilot was informative. My cousin said we paid some extra for extra room, but I am not sure how much. Our tickets said ""economy""."
Oct 2019,40,"Flight from Columbia, MO to Chicago, IL","Columbia, MO is a small airport and easy to fly out of. Currently, there is no charge for parking at the Columbia airport. I was able to park close to the terminal. I arrived several hours early, but it is not necessary when flying out of there. The lady at the check-in counter was very nice and helped me get my boarding pass. I have not flown very much by myself. I was flying Basic Economy and only a personal item is allowed. I also has a small fanny pack like purse on my waist with my passport and wallet in it and a small tote with my cane, hat, camera, and reading material in it, since it would have been hard to carry those items seperately. She said that I should have to check my personal item because of the sma;; flat tote and also commented that the fanny pack was not really allowed, but she would not count it. She said they would probably make me check it coming back (They didn't). I had checked the United web site, and, best I could tell, I should have been allowed to take those items anyway. I took a copy of the info from the web site with me, but never had to show it. There is a hefty charge ($85) if the bag has to be checked. Since the $85 applies for each way, that would be an expensive bag. The flight was smooth and the service on the plane was okay. The pilot kept us informed as there were problems with the weather in Chicago. We did not leave Columbia when scheduled, because he said we would not be able to land when we reached Chicago. As soon as he was notified that O'Hare was open, we took off. After reaching Chicago, the air traffic was so backed up, we had to wait our turn for about 45 minutes before reaching the gate. He also kept us informed during that time . That was very appreciated."
Oct 2019,40,Flying High,"Got fed up with American Airlines and tried United. On time departure, pleasant ground staff, excellent crew and timely connections. My only grudge is that even on international routes, you have to buy your alcohol. That's not nice United!"
Oct 2019,40,Flight from FLL to IAD,"Check-in, gate experience, flight itself - all very good. No wi-fi, which is starting to be more common than not, was irritating."
Oct 2019,10,Worst Airline 🤬🤬🤬,"I booked flights with United twice and both times had a horrible experience. First time flight was delayed 5 ours and second time flight cancel and they only offered me flights for the next day. They wouldn’t return my money because according to them it was due to the weather, but other airlines were flying to NY at the same time with no issues. NEVER booking a flight with United again 😡😡😡"
Oct 2019,30,Need a Bigger Plane,"Plane was way too small, even the flight attendant said that. Very uncomfortable. I was expecting a larger plane."
Oct 2019,50,A good trip after cancellations,"Flight time was around 6:00 am, at 11:00 PM night before received text that flight was cancelled due to weather. Checked the weather from her to Norfolk and there was none.  We were finally departed Oklahoma City the next day at 6:00 AM. A good flight through Atlanta to Norfolk"
Oct 2019,10,Terrible communication,"for Five hours it seemed like United had no idea where it’s planes were and when they were gonna land. Stupid airline, stupid communication. Will avoid this airline if possible."
Oct 2019,50,Great flights,"Flight from Indy to Newark was good.  Flight from Newark to Edinburgh Scotland was excellent.  Only 10 minutes of turbulence, which is astonishing on the flights to Scotland.  Cabin crew was polite, fun and excellent."
Oct 2019,20,Terrible end to a great holday,"Flying with United from the UK to the US is actually a pretty pleasurable experience. Good customer service, nice flight, good food etc. Once you arrive in the States, that all changes. Almost every internal flight is overbooked and passangers push the cabin luggage limits meaning it is never a smooth boarding. Our flight from Orlando to Newark on Friday was delayed. According to United it was due to Air Traffic Control limiting flights due to weather but the fact that technicians were changing a blown tire suggested differently. Several announcements were made suggesting short delays that ran into longer delays. Each time I checked at the desk that we'd make our connection to the UK and was assured we would. Other passangers were given alternative flights but even after finally boarding the flight, we were assured we'd be on our connecting flight. More delays on fuelling, clearance and eventually gating meant that we were not able to leave the plane until 20mins after our connecting flight was due to leave. Not a single agent there to assist us. Other passangers pointed us to a service desk where we were given a hotel and food vouchers. Less than ideal. However the experience got worse 24 hours later when we were back for the next flight. The flight was delayed, the gate changed 3 times and the check in agent refused to upgrade us to allow us to sit together as we'd originally booked. Thankfully one of the gate agents said she'd do some rearranging for us if she could. As I went to board, I asked a male agent if I'd had a seat change and he ignored me. When I asked again he told me it was a full flight so no changes. It wasn't a full flight so I challenged him. Big mistake. He turned so nasty so quickly and told me to move shouting 'SHE needs to move'. When I told him I was waiting for my party he told me he could have me removed from the flight. When I boarded, someone was sitting in my seat... His colleague had indeed moved people around and got us seated together. I was so thankful but so annoyed at her rude colleague. There is no need to lie to your customers like that. The screen showing empty seats was right behind him. What a way to respond to being called out. I feel United staff lied to us on many occasions during that trip. Yet the customer services guy and the gate agent that seated us together were so brilliant. United have some great staff, and they let them and passengers down with lies over poor service, overbooking and not controlling rude, controlling staff who have no place working with the public. Shame on them. Unfortunately the airline industry seems to be in chaos just now so I'm not travelling again for a while. Get it sorted! Official Complaint going off to United this week along with an insurance claim over delays. Leaves a bitter taste after such a great trip."
Oct 2019,10,"Not So, Hostess With the Mostest","Flying from Logan Int in Boston to STL Int via Dulles on United was a mess!!! My flight time was 556 so I arrived at 0300 to print tickets as I had just online numbers. The United Hostess assisting at the kiosk was extremely rude. When the kiosk alerted her to come check my military ID she rolled her eyes and then snatched my ID from my hand. She looked at the ID, then me and said,”pfft everyone has these! It doesn’t make you active duty.” I explained that no not everyone has military ids and motioned for my card back. She asked if I was gonna check a bag and I said yes. At this point the kiosk brought up a $30.00 fee that I questioned. She walked away from me without answering. I waved someone else over and was able to get my ticket printed, with no extra charges. Then stood in line to check my bag. When boarding I was scolded by the hostess for not coming up first and once on the plane someone was in my seat and refused to move. Finally got her to scooch over, just to find out she was supposed to be on the other side of the aisle! Just a hot mess. Will not fly them again!"
Oct 2019,10,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!,"My flight was unsafe. Boarding was dangerous. Food tasted dangerous. My employee blocked be from boarding even though she promised me I can board. Also, the restrooms in economy have poop everywhere and it smelled deadly in there!!!!! This flight was the most evil one I have ever been I'm my life so far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and one more thing, all of the flight attendants were screaming really loudly in everybody's ear in economy class all the time during the whole flight. AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
Oct 2019,40,Great Customer Service and On-time Flights,"When we booked the flight, I didn't notice we weren't assigned seats together, customer service took care of this problem for us. The flights were on time and it was great having only one stop along the way. Luggage was lost at the airport, but it was delivered to the ship in time for a cruise the next day! This was greatly appreciated!! Use the tram in Vancouver, what a great way to get downtown!!"
Oct 2019,40,"Delays, but well cared for","Weather in Chicago prevented many flights from landing or leaving that airport on Friday. As a result, only 2 of 6 flights got out of Sioux Falls the day before my Saturday flight. As the airlines was rebooking passengers, at check in, they asked for volunteers to bid on later flights. I volunteered. The staff could not have been better. They notified me in plenty of time to alert family member's and treated me with respect and care despite the fact that their computers at the gate were not loading properly or working correctly. They handled what could have been a nightmare professionally and courteously."
Oct 2019,20,Six Hours Of Hell,I was flying out of Chicago during rain storm and I was getting notifications all day that my plane was on time and would fly. Everything was going well and we boarded the plane a little earlier so we could take off on time since plane was there and ready. Well as soon as we were about to take off the pilot said we had to wait ten minutes because of lightning ok fine. But for six hours we were on plane waiting to take off and every time we were about to take off another update about the weather or they had to let another plane leave before us because they were waiting longer than us. My question is why did they let us board a plane that they knew wasn’t going to take off in the first place. They should have let us stay in waiting area so we could get food and use restrooms instead of sitting in seats for six hours. The pilot would constantly apologize for the inconvenience but we were all hungry and numb for sitting on plane is beyond me. The pilot said we could leave plane but didn’t say we would get refund for our flight. So only a couple of people got off. Was not a happy flight but no one went crazy on plane like you hear on the news. Thankfully my flight was on time and pleasant on the way back to Chicago.
Oct 2019,20,Im giving it a 2 only because they got us there alive...,"Horrible experience. Arrive at gate 2 hours early only to find out the plane they were just about to pack 400 passengers into had catastrophic engine failure.Surprised they didnt try to fly the thing out. This very plane I had flown in 4 days prior and had a computer crash before taxiing from gate. I was fairly concerned. Great plane,but this particular 777-200 was easily 25 years old. That's a LOT of comp-decomp cycles my friends, for an aluminum tube!  On the return they packed us into a 737-900 after a FOUR hour delay, completely full and possibly overweight. On takeoff the thing sounded like it was going to explode, and when retracting gear, we heard a LOUD pop,clunk that sounded like a part fell off the plane. Im never flying this sh*t airline again...I hadn't heard those noises since I parachuted out of a C-147."
Oct 2019,50,Customer service,Customer service was very helpful and informative considering the very tiring day due to weather delays!
Oct 2019,50,Customer Service,"I am blind and travel with my guide dog, Simba. Once again United has gone above and beyond to make sure we are comfortable, accommodated with a bulkhead seat (I am 6' 3"" and Simba weighs 70 lbs.) and provided with any assistance I require starting from check-in, connections and final destination."
Oct 2019,40,A La Carte Travel on United,"United Airlines provided a safe and comfortable flight: the seating was comfortable, the leg room was okay and the food was nicely served and pleasant. Given all that, what's the problem? My issue is there were additional fees for just about everything on the fight. Of course seating was included, but to avoid being in the middle seat, there was a fee. Carry on luggage was free, but to check a bag cost more, Forget about making any changes no changes are permitted in basic economy. I would take this flight again, but would need to be very cautious when making another reservation."
Oct 2019,20,Customer Service,Flights were ok but some of the worst customer service I have ever dealt with! I wanted to upgrade the ticket class and was quoted one price and then was charged 2-3xs the quoted amount. Wanted a refund and was a circus to get it.
Oct 2019,50,"Comfortable, On time",On time. Clean and comfortable seats. Great entertainment using the United App. The crew was friendly & courteous.
Oct 2019,10,UNITED AIRLINES CONTINUES TO SPIRAL,"Seven hour flight delay (2 hours at a time) for mechanical reasons, tried to force land the plane in a thunderstorm in Wichita, then the pilot decided to fly to Oklahoma City 50 minutes away. Another minor mechanical problem there and the pilot ran out of allotted time to fly. Waited 2 hours for a bus that shuttled 20 passengers to Wichita 3 hours away. No apologies from the gate people, no vouchers for food/water before or during our 3 hour bus trip. Called customer service, was told to go online and file a complaint as they don't talk to ti keyed customers. Twenty four hours after departing Phoenix we arrived into Wichita on our bus; exhausted, hungry, thirsty, and left at the airport. What an odd company UNITED has become. Deplorable"
Oct 2019,40,"A little cramped, but efficient","United’s staff, from ticketing to plane, were helpful, pleasant, and efficient. At 6 feet 4 inches I expected to be cramped in economy, and I was. It is what it is. You get what you pay for. Flight was on time and we got our luggage. What more can you ask for."
Oct 2019,10,Terrible Treatment by United Gate agent.,"I took a local flight from Lansing to ORD to connect by Star Alliance Lufthansa Premium class to Banglore India.I was ONE POUND overweight on one of my Check In Bags 51...In spite of explaining that I am allowed 2 Bags from ORD-FRA-BLR [total 140 lbs],the Gate agent one Ms L.P,refused to let it go inconveniencing us a lot..United response from Customer service was less than acceptable.If this is way United is going to treat STAR ALLIANCE passengers,i dont think they will ever be the Number One Airline of choice ..Also TSA seems to be in overdrive frisking one in 3 passengers."
Oct 2019,10,First and last flight ever with United. Going back to DELTA!!!,Went online to book a flight by price instead of sticking with what I’m familiar with (Delta). When I purchased the tickets I always know I will have to pay for checked bags but United even charges for carry on luggage. Beware when booking flights you get hidden charges that you don’t get with Delta. When any airline advertises the cheapest fair it should always have to be on an even playing field. I really feel like this was a bait and switch! Lesson learned! Back to Delta!!!
Oct 2019,40,Good and dependable,I fly united most of the times and used to of their system. Things works fine. My flight was also on time without any surprises
Oct 2019,40,Manchester - Chicago indirect,"Our flight to Chicago from Manchester flew indirect via Newark.    The international leg of the flight was faultless - we flew on a Boeing 767. The flight was comfortable and crew attentive. We had 3 bar services along with breakfast which consisted of chicken & waffles, eggs & bacon or a blueberry pie. Lunch was served quickly before landing and the only option available was a turkey and gouda pretzel roll.    Non-alcohol drinks are complimentary whilst on board.    In flight entertainment was up to date with some of the latest film releases and the feature to listen to audio between the captain and control tower. Free headphones are provided in flight.    Our domestic flight between Newark and O’Hare was a Boeing 737. This flight was rather uncomfortable due to the seating and lack of air conditioning.    Ground staff at both airports were friendly and helpful. I would happily chose to fly with United again."
Oct 2019,20,Delayed once again!,"Our flight out of Dulles (Washington D.C.) was scheduled to depart at 5:35 p.m. However, it did not depart for another 3 hours. Delays will happen, but it is how a delay is handled that matters. Without going into detail, United once again, did not properly deal with the matter at hand to our liking or that of many of the other passengers. This will be the last time we will fly on an United Airlines flight."
Oct 2019,50,Rating - Airline to Aruba,Flight was on time and service very good. Flight was non-stop and made very good time going and returning. Flight attendants were efficient.
Oct 2019,50,Oregon to Kona via SFO -RT - Perfect,"Great flight, service, layover in SF, bagage. All good - smooth and easy! Perfect in every way - United does it right"
Oct 2019,20,LLack of Ground Support,"Food was OK, but no selection prior to the flight. Beef was kind of tough and hard to cut in their little dishes. Kind of slow to get around to provide in-flight service. Boarding service and support at Kona was terrible! No assistance for disabled! Wife had to be raised up on a platform as they hand no ramps available to board the plane. No special boarding for 1st class. Could not recommend this airline."
Oct 2019,40,Pleasant surprise,"First plane in am so still clean. Stewardess looked neat and professional which is not the norm. Pleasant, helpful and polite. They @ctually served food which was almost edible but at least it was something. Left and arrived on time. All in all a good experience. Had not flown United in years because of their awful customer service reputation."
Oct 2019,40,This trip was OK,"Not a fan of United because of problems previously, but this trip was uneventful and as it should be. service was ok."
Oct 2019,30,Delays hourly,"In flight service is quiet good, US Airport service is average. Aircraft seems old. Seats very cramped ."
Oct 2019,40,United Airlines seat size is not as bad as first thought.,"I purchased the cheapest ticket I could find from Las Vegas to Lihue, Kauai. This was on United Airlines. The total per ticket was $421 on Basic Economy class of service. Remember you have to pay for your check-in bag ($30) and also for seats ($17-$47). I did not want to pay for a carry-on bag which was another $25 so I stuffed everything into my check-in bag.    I paid for two seats on row 32, the middle seat was $17 and the aisle seat was $24 if I remember correctly. It's best to just pay for the seat so you and your lover/partner aren't seated in different rows. I suggest you check seatguru. com to find info on the type of airplane you will fly. When I pulled up seatguru it mentioned the space was really limited and a lot of people complained about how small the space between the seat they were seated on and the seat in front. The space is limited however, I did not find that it was as bad as I imagined and I'm 5'9.    If you can find a cheaper price w/ Hawaiian airlines or Southwest by all means book w/ them so you don't have to pay for seats or carry-on luggage.    Another thing I enjoyed was that this plane had TV's w/ Direct TV while flying in the contiguous United States. When you are flying over water to get to Hawaii you are only able to choose from about 6 different current movies.    Lihue is pretty boring as everything closes by 9PM except for maybe local shady bars. It was worth it in my case since we took the Jurassic Falls Helicopter tour. Other than that, go to Mexico for cheap dining and well everything else. You're welcome :D"
Oct 2019,10,"Horrible, horrible","I have had lousy airline service and I just keep lowering my standards, but United gate staff at MSP take the cake and stomp on it. The first one was dismissive and rude. I asked, “I’d like to check to see if I’ll make my connection...” she interrupts me to tell me she didn’t know where I was going. So I finished “to Indianapolis.” Standing there with my ticket in my hand. And it got worse. I responded to a United email survey with no response. The one positive is when I landed in Chicago, I immediately received an email telling me what gate I was landing at and what gate I was leaving from. Terrible, awful, no good, very bad day."
Oct 2019,10,"Don't fly United's Business Class internationally, it's a RIP OFF","DON'T USE UNITED'S BUSINESS CLASS! RIP OFF! Had hoped to sleep on this 15 hour flight, but the ""bed"" was just a long, uncomfortable seat. Virgin and other airlines, give you a true bed that you can actually sleep on, for the same price. Also, I had to try to crawl over the woman next to me every time I got up, which was impossible, so I had to disturb her which inconvenienced her and embarrassed me. I could not sleep and the internet was not working, so I watched some stupid movie until my neck hurt because I could not adjust the screen on the back of the seat. (even when the internet works on United, you can't stream, but you can on other airlines). Basically false advertising for United to even call this Business Class. On top of it, the purser was a jerk. Would have used another airline had I known what a ripoff United was.  I've flown other airlines and am used to a bar with a spread during the flight. United's offering was a joke: a little table shoved between the jump seats. The meager offering included some packaged cheese snack plates, cheesecake cut into little squares and chips. Pathetic. The rude stewardess made snide comments when we approached this table. I don't know what her problem is, but her attitude helped to make this trip very unpleasant.  I agree with the other reviewers. United does not even deserve ONE star."
Oct 2019,50,Comfortable,The flight attendants were very professional and nice. Helped fix a air issue and overall the entire crew were professional .
Oct 2019,40,What a Deal!!!,"I purchased my ticket late and ended up with Budget Economy, yes that is group 5. But, in Newark just prior to boarding to fly to Chicago then wait and fly to Sacramento United Representative made me a deal. I waited in Newark and flew direct to Sacramento in First Class. I was compensated with a very health travel voucher and $30 of food vouchers. Thank you, United."
Oct 2019,50,Much Better Than Anticipated,"With all the negative news about United, we were uncertain what to expect. From the check-in clerk to the final picking up our luggage we have no complains. We were greeted at check-in, when boarding, and when getting on-board. Service on-board was simple....beverages and pretzels. Surprised they would not let people change seats once the plane was in the air. Must pay to get a different seat....period.  Our flight left on time and was 10 minutes late arriving due to some storms. We will fly United again."
Oct 2019,50,Flight 1965 from Denver to Calgary,"The flight started off rocky with our plane breaking down before we even got on it. However, they were able to find an alternative plan very quickly and we were only delayed about an hour. They were even able to make up some time in the air and we arrived early. The meal was excellent and the ride comfortable. Overall, a great flight."
Oct 2019,30,Basic Economy Works for Short Trip to Grand Canyon,"Remember this!! United basic economy will NOT allow you to bring a carry on only a personal bag and you must check the suitcase to your destination. This restriction really made us rethink what to bring in our personal bag and what to trust to United in our checked bag.  It turns out a short 3 day trip to the Grand Canyon went fine and our checked bag arrived as it should and we carried extremely light for the air part of the trip.  The amazing thing United has missed in promoting their flights is the Denver to Flagstaff flights that leave Denver at sunset. We had a window seat to watch the sunset over the western mountains and chase that sunset for an HOUR+. Such a treat that the pilots and crew do on a regular basis.  Another TIP check your gates from one flight to the next. We literally landed at Gate B11 and had to be at B89 in 47 minutes. No matter what the flight you can get a feel for gates will be involved by monitoring previous flights and the gates they ended up using. As seniors pushing 70's the ""cart"" saved us from missing the next flight."
Oct 2019,50,Excellent vegan fair.,"For airline food, the vegan dinner and breakfast were terrific. The fruit bowl for breakfast was especially refreshing at the end of a long flight. The movie selections were numerous. I rated a 9. The only downside was that some fiend took my pillow early into the nine hour flight. Odd."
Oct 2019,40,Good Flight,Good flight - check in was very efficient and organized and the flight arrived on-time with no problems.
Oct 2019,40,Right on time and smooth,Nice flight ORD to PDX. On time departure and arrival. Exactly the way you expect a top airline to operate. Not all things can be controlled but proper planning seems to help.
Oct 2019,10,NEVER NEVER AGAIN. Always late and rude,Planned a weekend to Aspen. 2 hour flight turned into a 12 hour ordeal....BOTH WAYS. After getting on the late flight and closing the door. The Captain informed us we would be heading to a different airport and then get bussed to the original destination - a 3 hours ride in the middle of the night. WHY did he wait to tell us that after the airplane door was closed. I would have never got on the flight if that was the case. Had to re arrange our pickup time to 4am - good luck finding someone to pick you up at 4 am and a closed airport. Total BS. Never again will I take United. All my buddies have horror stories with United as well.
Oct 2019,50,UNITED FLIGHTS ARE EASY AND ON TIME,i love flying united. their planes have in flight apps for movies and shows usually have electrical outlets for phones. Beverages except alcohol are free... flight attendants are generally very attentive and pleasant
Oct 2019,50,Another good flight to FL,"Easy check in thru TSAPre, no waiting , agents were pleasant and efficient. Airline crew greeted us with smiles and it was a no event trip."
Oct 2019,30,On time-not,"We were delayed 30 minutes in the terminal due to a ""Ground Delay"" at Newark. The lines for group one and two lined up as usual, and just stood there. I was the third one on line for Group 3. while on line it was mentioned that the over head lockers on the plane was about 60% full. As I approached to enter the plane, they said that I had to check in my rolling bag, therefore I did, even though I was the 3rd on line for Group 3. As I got on the plane at my seat at 31A, there were only 4 empty luggage spot let in the rear of the plane. I could had one of those spots. Then we pulled away form the gate and waited another 15 minutes, but it was recorded as on time, because it left the gate. The stewards weren't all that friendly, but the pilot seemed considerate."
Oct 2019,20,Unreliable.......at least locally,"Only referring to local flights PQI-EWR and reverse - I have never seen such consistent...inconsistency. It's not a delayed flight here and a cancelation there it is several times a week. It has gotten so bad that anyone who has a set time to be at heir destination, meeting, business, etc either flys out of Bangor or drives all the way to Boston 400+ miles away, that alone should be a huge red flag. There are no other flight options as PQI-EWR and EWR-PQI are the only flights offered. Travelers have been stranded in Newark for days because of continuous cancelations. Several times United has flown all the way to PQI and then returned all the way to EWR without landing."
Oct 2019,20,United Goes out of Their Way to make Customers Uncomfortable,"Check in went smoothly. Our Basic Economy seats were assigned at check in traveling together.  We both were seated n the middle seat, several rows apart - Which we expected. However, the flight was not full. There were several non-middle seats available leaving no reason for United to go out of their way to have seated us both, in center seats, several aisles away from each other. Of course, there was no in flight entertainment available. Regarding cleanliness, there was gum stuck on the safety flyer in the seat pocket in front of me (Yuck!)  On the plus side, after take off United personnel did not stop us from moving to more comfortable seats together.  After this we will pay whatever it takes, take flights with extra stops, etc. to avoid flying with this rude, clip joint of an airline.  There were no issued with the baggage."
Oct 2019,40,Excellent Gate Agents and Excellent Pilot,After we had cleared TSA Pre-check and cleared U.S. Customs at YVR Airport in Vancouver Canada my son realized he had left his new Fitbit at TSA. We immediately contacted the gate agents for our flight. They contacted TSA and were able to retrieve my son's Fitbit. Our flights home were also delayed. Our flight from Denver to RDU was delayed due to a flat tire and overheated brakes from the previous landing. We were glad our pilot was on top of things and made us aware of why we were delayed. We also had to detour around weather returning home but landed safely in Raleigh an hour late.
Oct 2019,40,Had a good Flight,Traveled from Rochester to Tampa with 1 stop each way. Flight attendants were very accommodating. There were empty seats and the attendants let us change seats for more comfort.
Oct 2019,40,Probably the Best US transatlantic airline,Having travelled transatlantic over a dozen times in the last 10 years the majority have been with Continental/United airlines. Customer services when required are always courteous and more than willing to help with most queries. On one occasion a brought a guitar with me from the US to the UK. The Cabin crew on this occasion couldn’t have been more accommodating. They actually placed my guitar and case in their own storage and moved some of their own items to 1st class - outstanding service. We generally travel economy or economy plus but on all occasions the crew are kind and courteous . Food is more than good enough and economy seats are comfortable. In flight entertainment provides more than enough viewing for the 7hr 30 min flight combining a great mix of current movies and tv shows. Plenty of games to tuck into too. We do have a choice when travelling to the US but always choose United for the reasons outlined - highly recommended
Oct 2019,10,Worst Airline Service EVER,"Worst experience ever. I have flown on all different airlines and this is by FAR the worst flight. They sat myself, my husband, and my 6 year old in all different locations and refused to even look if there were any near each other. The lady at the desk was so rude and told me I couldn’t choose my seats. I know that. I asked if she could sit me with my child. Ridiculous. Will never fly with United EVER again."
Oct 2019,10,Consumer,Forced to sit 26 rows away from my 6 year old child. Apparently united airlines doesn’t care about me or my family. Will never fly again.
Oct 2019,40,"Easy, smooth and on-time","My round trip to Las Vegas on business flying United was easy, smooth and on-time. The air conditioner on the flight out of IAH kicked in late but otherwise nothing to complain."
Oct 2019,40,Comfortable journey,The seating space on the plane is spacious and comfortable  Full entertainment equipment  The only drawback is that the cleaning is slightly worse.
Oct 2019,50,I am very satisfied with the business class service from Taipei to San Francisco.,The space on the plane is spacious and comfortable  Air service staff is excellent  The meals served in the course are very delicious.
Oct 2019,10,Food is terrible,"Staff were very good, nice & helpful we’re they could be. Not much food & what was given was absolutely horrible, no one could eat it. Seats were extremely hard & uncomfortable."
Oct 2019,10,First class menu: mac n’cheese OR chips and Humus,"Only 12, in first class on this flight; no adult food ! stewardess says “I don’t make the menus”.; also sound on TV and picture was poor; WiFi avail for a fee. This service would be characterized as economy in Europe."
Oct 2019,50,Flight,Great service from all stewardess’s on the flight yesterday. Lots of humor and customer service.  Thank you to the United MCI staff.
Oct 2019,50,Great Flight,"This was one of my most comfortable seating on a Plane with extra leg room without paying extra, I was very surprised. And they told me that my fare did not include carry on, but apparently my bag did not fit under my seat, so I was able to put my bag in the overhead with no charges. I was very pleased with this flight."
Oct 2019,30,Premium Economy,"The seats were great, the location was right behind business class. The food was not good, it was pretty dry and not very nutritious."
Oct 2019,40,Flight 1258 from San Diego to Denver,"Flight was pretty good. We left early and arrived early. There were some issues with the internet - cut out a couple of times during the flight. The meal was okay through I wish there was a hot entree. The seat was okay though I wish it was a little more comfortable. Overall, it was a good flight."
Oct 2019,40,"International (Paris) Excellent, National-not so much","Flying United, Business, to Paris will remind you of the good old days of flying, only better. The little cubicles with the fully reclining beds are very comfortable but the stars of the flight are food, wine, and service. This was by far the best flight I've had since the unfortunate merger of Continental and United. The cabin attendants were professional, attentive and fun! The dinner was lovely and the wines delicious. 5 star experience.  However, the flight from Orlando to Newark was very different. Indifferent service, bad food and undrinkable wine made me wish I had flown another airline. The flight to Paris made it seem as though United was stepping up to Continental's standards while the domestic flight was more like the United of old."
Oct 2019,50,Great Flight,"It was a great flight. We went out to Illinois for a funeral and we had a great flight from United. Great customer service and comfortable seats.. I liked this flight, even though the delay. Would definitely recommend."
Oct 2019,20,Horrible customer service at check in,"What horrible customer service. Extremely rude check in agent. Our bags were paid for and we had our boarding pass on our phone all we had to do was get a bag tag and drop the luggage. Detroit United kiosks do not print luggage tags and you have to check luggage with an agent. We arrived 1 hour before our domestic flight to find that out and along with at least 100 other people were waiting in a line to drop luggage. Only 2 agents worked the counter. Both were extremely rude and not helpful. After waiting a half hour we still had 20 people ahead of us and were going to miss our flight. I asked the agent for help and she yelled at me to get back in line. She then asked all people on our flight to come to the front of line. I was the last person to be helped in the people that went forward. She then accused me of not coming up forward when she called people, and told me I was late for my flight. I explained I was there and even had people in line tell her I was there. She then WALKED AWAY from me and went and helped 2 other customers. I than missed the time window to have my bags checked in even though I would have made it to the gate. After another 10 minutes she came back to me and said too bad you missed your flight and you have to travel with your bag so we have to re book you on another flight. I was suppose to arrive in San Francisco at 1030 and she had us arriving at 330p in the afternoon and said there was no other flight she could give us. I ran to the gate and asked for a supervisor who got us on another flight at the same time with a different connection arriving in san fran at noon. Kudos to your gate attendant Cee Jay and your supervisor Stephanie for calming me down and getting us on another flight. What a disappointment United. You have to work on your customer service. Its HORRIBLE!"
Oct 2019,40,On Time,Though left late from Chicago O'Hare we reached before time and it was raining. In previous travels I have experienced delays but this time was lucky.
Oct 2019,40,PR Vacation with United,"Airlines are trying to fill as many seats as possible at the expense of legroom, Maybe it's time to choose certain flights that are frequently filled and possibly increase at least 1 row of seats and expand the legroom evenly."
Oct 2019,30,Needs improvement!,"The service and the flight was nice but as usual we were delayed,,,over 3 hours....I thought they should have given out tickets for at least a sandwich. It was a weather delay coming in so they knew it would be that long. They could have brought in another plane or at least given out sandwiches for being delayed at dinner time, instead they gave out little bottles of water and chips,"
Oct 2019,40,Great meal! Really!,I've never been impressed by airline food but returning from Germany we had a excellent meal that was Indian. The ice cream on the flight was also very good...I suppose it was to go along with the meal. It was vanilla with ginger. We were all very surprised.
Oct 2019,40,Full flight!,"The flight attendants did everything they could to hurry (in a good way) us into our seats as the pilots had been told they could take off sooner if the plane was secure. We may have...The plane was packed but it wasn't noisy, thank goodness, as it was an early morning flight. We were in the back of the plane (we actually like flying back there) but this time it resulted in less choices for snacks by the time the attendants got to us. In the morning I would have preferred the cookies to pretzels but it was either pretzels or Stroopwaffle--I think they ran out of cookies. IT was just a 2 hour flight so no big deal, really. . United had upgraded us to Economy Plus on the way down to TN and on the way back we could see what a nice difference that was!"
Oct 2019,40,Lots of headroom!,"We were in basic economy. No assigned seats. No cancellations. No checked bags. But, we went in with full knowledge and paid a bargain fare. Flying internationally, basic economy does allow for a personal item (a backpack) plus a carry on piece of luggage. We managed fine. I did check a bag I bought on the flight home as I bought a lot of stuff ($60 one way). We flew on the 787-8 Dreamliner. I was impressed with the headroom especially, I'm 5'9 and my boyfriend is 6'3 and he didn't really have to bend down to get in and out with the overhead bins. The overhead bins are higher up and seem much larger than normal, I have no idea if they really are bigger though....The plane was great. Tons of new movies and good entertainment. Okay, back to no seat assignments. The flight there was full and we were seated far apart. I asked at the gate and she got us closer, we had a connecting flight in Denver and when we go to Denver there was now way. Anyway, I was told the person next to me was a solo ticket and they were nice enough to switch. The flight home a solo traveler was inbetween us so we switched. It was pretty seamless. Lots of free wine and beer flowing. Actually pretty good food. Better than my last international flight on Norweigan, that's for sure. Overall I was skeptical about Uniteds basic ecomony, but I read a few good blog posts about peoples positive experiences so we took a chance and we will again!"
Oct 2019,30,O'Hare Nightmare,"Our post Packer’s game flight from Appleton to Orlando was repeatedly delayed, then cancelled after over 7 hours in the Appleton airport. All of the delays were due to Chicago weather—advise booking flights that don’t use O’Hare as a connection, if possible. We ended up driving to Chicago, and catching the first flight out the following day. Appleton is small, and it was quite boring to spend the day in their airport, but it was obviously good business for the airport concession! ; )"
Oct 2019,20,United's quality has taken a nose dive!,We use to enjoy flying United Business on International flights. We will begin to look elsewhere because of the nose dive United has taken. Nothing was pleasant about the trip.
Oct 2019,10,"IF YOU BOOK WITH THEM, THINK TWICE","United robbed me, since I charged for an additional suitcase in his partner airline, having included in the franchise.    I was treated very bad, and they not think about the customer, I recomend to see other options, to not find surprises."
Oct 2019,10,Luggage,Worst airline ever I called the customer service to ask about the cost of luggage she told the first check in bag $30 the second one for $40 and the third one for $50 when I went to the airport they paid $220 instead of $120 I payed $100 dollars extra they could’ve be honest with me and tell really cost i don’t recommend this airline
Oct 2019,20,economy plus not a plus,"My husband and I paid additional for economy plus seats to ensure (we thought) extra legroom, but also a window and aisle seat in the same row. These seats were chosen for health reasons. On the day of the flight we discovered that our premium economy seats had been switched and moved to the center of the middle section and not even in the same row together. When we questioned this we were told there was a change in the aircraft, however, the seat configuration was very much the same. We later learned our seats were given to premier exec. status (or whatever it is called) customers! We were even given the old ""legally we only have to get you from point A to point B"" remark! So unless you are a high mileage customer forget getting the seat you selected even if you paid extra for it! Terrible customer service!"
Oct 2019,40,"Great pilot, spoke with him as we waited for the plane to arrive.","This was an old, old airplane. Someone who said they had 2 million plus miles had mentioned it was part of the Continental fleet at one time. The crew did a great job, but it was very cold inside the plane. We were supposed to leave at 6:30 PM and arrive at 9:30 PM. The jet had been sitting on the ground for three hours and they couldn’t get it towed to the gate on time. Nearly leaving an hour late. We got in at 10:15 PM made up some time and it was the most perfect landing I have ever had. Did not even know we had touched down. The pilot lived in Huntington Beach and wanted to get home ASAP. But he was truly a nice gentleman and I wish to Thank the flight crew for their fine service."
Oct 2019,40,"Long trip,Good flight","A long flight from Knoxville TN to Anchorage Alaska was made bearable by United Airlines. We flew into Houston then on to Anchorage. Our layover was just long enough to catch our breath and eat lunch before traveling on. The flight from Knoxville was fun as my husband complimented the flight attendant on the cookie and she slipped him 3 more. She stood in the aisle and chatted about where the cookie came from and how it was made and how to enjoy it better with hot cocoa. Just friendly and sweet. She made our trip.. The flight home was a blur because we were so tired, but we had no problems."
Oct 2019,30,Streamline The Boarding Process,I fly a lot and when possible avoid United. Their boarding process is too long with all the different levels. Also I am finding that their gate crews in all airports are not that friendly. The only positive this is their online check in
Oct 2019,50,Perfect flight for a perfect holiday,"Couldn't fault United airlines. From check in to boarding and landing. Staff all very helpful. No delays. Cabin service was brilliant, in flight entertainment was very good.  Well done.."
Oct 2019,40,Short & Sweet,"There was a time United Airlines was a premium carrier, no matter how long or short the flight was and I logged hundreds of thousands of United miles. However, while this flight was short, the service was sure lacking. You got sat, buckled up and off into the sky. No TV, no WIFI Service, No beverage, no reading material, no nothing. It was simply a flight, which, after all, it was what I paid for but I would definitely re-visit flying boring United."
Oct 2019,50,Refund,"They gave me a refund on a Basic Economy trip when they didn’t have to, which was very nice. A warning though, don’t buy basic economy tickets. There is no flexibility"
Oct 2019,10,"Basic Economy is a joke, don't do it!",I understand that seat selection is not included at the economy price but its ridiculous to assign seats intentionally separating family just as a penalty. I booked 5 tickets and we were spread rows apart; it seems accidentally 2 seats might have been open next to each other. The return flight had no seats assigned until boarding which then didn't allow an option for upgrade to seat assignment. Have flown to Hawaii more than 15 times and this was the worst experience. I will continue to fly on any other airlines than United for my future business.
Oct 2019,10,Worst airlines ever!,Lots of delayed flights and mismanagement at United airlines. It took me 3 days to reach my destination while it should take only 20 hours!!! United Airlines is well-known for its delayed flights along with a very bad customer service. Oh my goodness! I don’t recommend it to anyone.
Oct 2019,10,The “we are out of that” fight,"We were literally the first people on the plane in Business class. We didn’t even have our luggage in the overhead bin before we were asked what we wanted for lunch, we had not even seen a menu. We both chose chicken. A few minutes later the flight attendant came back and said they were out of chicken. How can that be when we were literally the first people to order? We changed to the fish, they said even the captain had to change from the chicken. The flight attendant said 10 people got chicken, ok, we were the first to place an order? The exact same thing happened on the flight over.    The day before our fight was to depart we got a text saying our flight was cancelled and we were rebooked a day later and they wanted us to choose a flight for the day after our original departure, I did that. I then received another text an hour later saying it had all been worked out and our original flight was still on and on time, really??? I already changed everything to the next day, my hotel, which I lost 85,000 points changing. I called United and told them the situation, they could have cared less. They were able to get me back on my original flight, but I was totally out the 85,000 points for my room in NYC. I will not be flying United again, they truly don’t care about your situation at all.    I would use United as the absolute last option when flying, the delays, changes and lack of being adequately stocked with supplies for long fights is unacceptable.    The plane is also very old and rundown, rips in the leather. Ugghhh"
Oct 2019,40,"Not the best flight, not the worst","The flight departed from Munich and had a layover at Dulles. However mechanical issues with the plane from Dulles to Seattle delayed take off for approximately two hours. On both flights the flight attendants were professional, friendly, and courteous."
Oct 2019,10,Stuck 1700 miles from home again!worst first time flight experience ever,After taking off early flight managed to be half an hour late! Missing my next departure! Customer service desk was not only unhelpfull but also rude i didnt even land before my next flight had alredy left. Now had to spend 150 between a taxi and a hotel because im stuck in a now 10 hour layover after having an almost 9 hour layover on the original fight. Inexcusable management. I took a bus before and will again worst 700 well now almost 900 dollars! have ever spent in my life.
Oct 2019,30,First with United,"I have nothing special to report; the flight boarded on time and there were minimal delays taking off. Landed on time. This was a midnight to 6AM flight and in economy, it was a little tight space-wise but as to the service and comfort--Average and with no irritations noted"
Oct 2019,50,Excellent airline with many destinations,It is easy and convenient to book tickets online with Competitive fare. The service on our flight was excellent with good food and excellent selection of drinks. The bathrooms were kept clean during the flight. The temperature was comfortable during the 16 hours flight time. Also the boarding on departure and the exiting on arrival was very quick.
Oct 2019,40,Was a long flight for older travelers,"The trip lasted 18 hours and 7 time zones from Wichita Ks to Chicago to Munich Germany to Berlin Germany. The airports are very large and getting from one gate to another was sometimes on the other side of the airport, if it had not been for the airport wheelchair service (for my wife) that got us to where we needed to be, we would never have made any of the connections due to delays on the ground due to gates not cleared for us to deplane, customs and other things. We sometimes got to our depature gate with less then 5 minutes to spare. One other thing, if you are tall, NEVER FLY ECOMONY, PAY THE EXTRA AND DO ECONOMY PLUS, the seats are better (these are the old 1st class seats) for international flights or long flights over two hours. I talked to several other passengers and they said they will never fly ecomony again. Ecomony is ok for short flights of less then two hours. The one good thing on the international flight is they made sure that you stayed Hydrated with plenty of bottled water and juices"
Oct 2019,40,No frills but no complaints,United Airlines may not have wowed me but they got me where I was going when I needed to be there so no complaints.
Oct 2019,50,PERFECT FLIGHT,"Perfect flight, stewardes were very attentive, plenty to eat & drink. No turbulance & plenty of movies 7 TV to watch. What else can I say, except I usually fly United and have never had a problem. Hope it stays that way."
Oct 2019,50,Exceptional staff,"The way airlines should be. Pleasant and happy to give me as many free coffee and soda as I asked for. Usually, they give you the""look"" for intruding. They forget that customers (cramped in a tiny space for 5 hours) pay their bills."
Oct 2019,10,International United Airlines...Horrible,"United Airlines sucks, they just do, plain and simple they suck. On our flight from Narita Tokyo to Houston Texas we experienced rude and condescending flight attendant staff. We watched the United staff scold out a foreigner that didn’t speak any English and mistook her instructions. My wife speaks Vietnamese so we talked to that person and he said he’s never been treated like that in his many years of travel (his first time flying on United) I feel embarrassed to be an American. Plus the Boeing 777-200 was in poor shape, some of the infotainment screens didn’t work on our row, so a few of our guest suffered a 13 hr flight leaning over and watching other’s screens or just trying to sleep in United’s crappy-barely-reclined-Premium-economy-seats-for 13 hrs. The toilets were very worn and some third world countries had better looking bathrooms, pathetic for an American own airline. The food was horrible also, no meat in any of their pasta dishes, just cheap noodles. Also the plastic utensils were a joke, specially were other airlines that fly International have metal utensils or heavier duty plastic ones. United Airlines is an embarrassment to our country, a pathetic airline. I’ve never witness such disrespect to other foreigners and to their own country persons, United Airlines should be ashamed!! I will not fly United Airlines internationally ever again, ever!!! And I’ll post everywhere I go how horrible and an embarrassment they put to our society!! I do not recommend Untied Airlines!"
Oct 2019,50,Awesome planes and more awesome staff!,"As we were waiting at the gate to board the flight, our names got called. When we came to the gate agent, he handed us our new seat assignment. We were making our way home after a few days is Las Vegas and it was getting late so we didn't think anything of it or say anything - just chill compliance. We took our new boarding passes and imagine the surprise when I realized the gate agent had not only 1.) noticed it was my birthday, but 2.) took it upon himself to provide us a free upgrade to economy plus!! What a thrill! And the flight attendants were sure to wish me a happy birthday on the plane, too. I felt super special."
Oct 2019,30,Good Morning Flight Time from DC to London; Bad Food,"I love the morning flight United has from Dulles to London Heathrow. It leaves Dulles at about 8:15 a.m. and gets to London just before 9 p.m. with the time change. Love it because you can get a good night's sleep when you get to London and wake up the next day almost in the right timezone. Have taken this flight multiple times.  The only complaint I have is the food is SO bad. I can't tell you exactly what was served for breakfast because the flight attendants totally missed our row when they were serving. That didn't bother me because I already knew there was only a 5% chance that anything would be edible anyway. Then came a small sandwich about an hour and a half before landing. It consisted of a dry stale white bread roll with a single slice of cheap lunch meat ham on it and a single slice of what looked to be american cheese and nothing else. No mustard. No mayo. Nothing. It could have been my imagination, but I think the flight attendants were embarrassed about it and I don't blame them."
Oct 2019,40,"A Tired Embraer 175, but a 20 minute early arrival","Although the interior looked a bit tired, the mechanics were just fine. We left 5 minutes early and arrived 20 minutes early. The flight operated by Republic (United Express) was staffed by two friendly flight attendants. Every seat was taken, and though a bit narrow, my ""compression class"" (economy class) seat had ample legroom. As we were in an early boarding group due to our United credit card, we did not have to gate check our two cary ons. Overhead storage bins are not large, but a 20 inch hard side fits horizontally. I fear if each passenger had one, half of the bags would have been gate checked. Our flight was mid morning and a warning to fellow MSP flyers. With the current airport renovation, unless you have TSA pre check, arrive at least two hours early. We came just under two hours prior to flight time with boarding passes in hand and no bags to be checked. With pre check we breezed through security. However looking at the regular security line, if we joined it on our arrival at the airport we might have missed our flight."
Oct 2019,30,United is not the same,"Took a United flight from Vancouver, BC to Houston TX and the flight was late leaving and late arriving. The crew on the flight was tired and never smiled. The seat were dated and old. I was lucky to get some thing to drink for free along with a small cookie. so if flying with United pack your bags and pack your patient as it is just a bus in the sky with nothing special."
Oct 2019,40,Philadelphia to Denver,"First I would like to say Philadelphia is horrible airport, this has nothing to do with United Airlines but I just had to say it. Now for United, the attendents were fine it was an early morning flight, 6:30 am. I guess my biggest complaint is allowing people to board with bags that are obviously over the size limit and use all the space in the overhead and you have no room for your bag. Then we have a 6:30 flight and they give you a bag of stale pretzels. I don't fly for the food but the money you pay for a ticket is insane, they could get something better, mini dougnuts, belvita breakfast bars anything would be an improvement."
Oct 2019,50,Wonderful passenger care,"This was our first flight out of Burlington so were unfamiliar with the area/airport. Our confusion led to our being too late to check our bags prior to boarding, but the collective staff came to our rescue and got our bags gate checked and us on board for a pleasant flight home. We were so happy to see that our bags arrived, too! Very good experience!"
Oct 2019,40,United>British Airways,"United is overlooked often due to the press, however on all of my flights I have had a good time. The meals (being plane food) were rather nice including curry on the way out to New York. The tv screens are of good size and leg room is also ok. The staff were extremely friendly too. They are often less popular than British Airways as an airline however they tick all the boxes for a cheaper flight (because of less demand). So if you’re looking to save money and have a good experience then choose United."
Oct 2019,50,Great flight!,"I was very worried about this flight, since it was almost 10 hours long and my husband is very tall. However, it was very comfortable. We were fortunate to have a row to ourselves and the United seats are comfortable and had enough leg room for the hubby to be comfortable. The onboard entertainment is super helpful to make the time pass quickly. Check in was easy and efficient. My husband also accidentally left his cell phone on board and the United employees went above and beyond to quickly go back to the plane and find the phone. Great job ladies in Houston!"
Oct 2019,20,Lack of attention in first class,"When you upgrade to First Class or if you purchase First Class directly your expectations of the flight are and should be that you will be pampered like a First Class passenger should be.  The only good think about this flight is that we arrived early and our luggage didn't take to long which is a shock at ORD  As far as the in flight service I can't see what I paid for.  No beverage upon entry to plane.  I dozed off just before the meal service and woke up while they were removing the trays and I asked what choices I had and they said sorry we're out of meals. The kicker was I watched every flight attendant and even the pilots get the same meals we had, I didn't even get offered a snack or even a drink at that point. Not only did I not get a meal but I had to watch the staff eat in the galley while several of the guests had to walk up to them and ask for refills. They walked through the cabin and only stopped at four of the 16 FC seats.  Not happy with this flight and I will be taking this up with Customer Service."
Oct 2019,40,Manchester to Washington,The first leg of this flight started 45 minutes late but fortunately we were able to make up most of the time. The aircraft was clean and comfortable and the service very good. The entertainment system worked fine though many of the movies were quite outdated now.The food was acceptable but not great.  The second leg of the flight from Newark to Washington only took 30 minutes when it was scheduled to take an hour. Unfiortunatelt the half hour we gained we lost again sitting on the tarmac waiting for a gate.
Oct 2019,50,No issues with my flight,"Nice smooth flight. Pleasant staff, no delays. I hear a lot of flight complaints from travelers. So far we have not had issues with any airline weve ever flown."
Oct 2019,10,First Time Flier,"What an absolutely sh*tty experience. I called 3 times and spoke to 3 different individuals before flying out. Between Baggage Services and a service supervisor, I was told my luggage would be transferred for my layovers in San Fran. My flight to Maui was almost a 12 hour layover, and from Maui was a 16 hour layover. My very first flight (to San Fran) was terrible. From what I gathered from my wife and other passengers(frequent fliers), the cabin was not ""depressurized"" properly. It felt like our ears were bleeding and wouldn't stop, it plainly sucked. Now we are back on the mainland and have no luggage. After visiting United Baggage Services, we were NOW told they DO NOT transfer luggage for layovers over 11 hours. Again - both of my layovers were over 11 hours; I called prior to first flight(since I've never flown before); AND my bags were transferred for my first layover(over 11 hours). In all, United Airlines provided false information and a terrible first experience for me. I WILL NOT be flying United ever again."
Oct 2019,20,Gate attendant - Rowan,"I had never traveled with UAL and were happy and excited to start our vacation overseas until we had to interact with Rowan, a gate attendant on the Mia-Paris flight on 9/5/19. My wife was in front of me as we were boarding and she singled her out without reason, spoke to her in a demeaning manner without any provocation that everyone around started looking, she is an American citizen mind you, didn’t approach her politely, spoke down to her, made her check her bag because “there was no more space on board” so when we questioned why she was being singled out and people behind us kept going thru with their pieces of luggage, her tone and choice of words continued, she simply smiled and got cocky with each response. I let her know that she should use a different tone of voice and be polite which had no effect on her - I think my wife and us were discriminated as the issue with “space” onboard was not the issue, we saw plenty of empty spots inside the plane once boarded, additionally, when I asked her name she answered smiling and said “Rowan, would you like me to spell it?” You need to do whatever I want” we felt defenseless. She really got our vacation started on a sour note, I don’t think UAL has done anything to correct the attitudes of some of their team members, as far as I know, Rowan needs to work facing a wall if working at all, personally I would fire her. I will not fly UAL again."
Oct 2019,10,SkyWest if terrible,"The plane was so hot I was actually getting sick. After talking to other passengers, they were feeling the same way. Flight attendant was not friendly nor courteous. Worst flight I have even been on."
Oct 2019,40,Not too bad in Premium Economy,"I haven't flown in a decade, but I have to admit everything went pretty smoothly. Check in and security at the airport was efficient, and the flight was uneventful. I opted for Premium Economy to give myself a little more legroom, and it was worth the price in my opinion. Had no one sitting in the seat next to me, so I got the whole row to myself for the flight. Used my phone and the United app for in-flight entertainment. Seats were kinda uncomfortable but that's just from them cramming as many people onto a plane as they can now a-days."
Oct 2019,10,"United - All Greed, No Customer Service","I will never fly United again. I would rather forego a trip because the fare is too expensive on another airline or because there is no availability of flights. United's bag fees and policies are ridiculous and create tremendous confusion and stress. Selecting a seat assignment is equally obnoxious and stressful. Every step of the way (booking, checking in, actual travel, getting baggage) is filled with reminders that United is far more interested in squeezing every penny it can squeeze out of its customers, than it is in providing a pleasant, comfortable, stress-free experience. It was almost as if United's number one goal was to remind me that every time I chose the lesser fare, there would be a toll to be paid in discomfort and stress. My seat assignment was directly next to the smelly bathroom, the seats were small and uncomfortable, I was not able to bring my very small carry-on to the flight and was forced to place it under . . . . but they lost it and then failed to take necessary steps to get me my bag. It's been 24 hours, and they still have no idea where my bag is. My connecting flights in Denver were on completely different terminals (not something that is known to me when I book the flight) and I only had 20 minutes to get there. Trying to recover my lost bag was an ordeal in itself. It is the absolute greediest, most inconsiderate airline I have ever flown."
Oct 2019,20,Training trip to Cleveland,"UA 4248 to ORD on 9/30/2919    Flight delayed over two hours . Plane had to be restarted , twice & problem not resolved . Disembarked and rerouted through another hub to Cleveland 5 hours later , after expected arrival .  Airline personnel did a great job rebooking & I did get to destination , but this did have pen and it was extremely inconvenient ."
Oct 2019,50,Amazing service,"A month ago I lost my Husband and recently adopted a rescue dog. I live in Baltimore, had a good friend puppy sit her. My little rescue dog was abused and while walking my pup she broke away and couldn't be found. I was in Ca visiting family when I learned my fur baby was lost. I called the ticketing company Travelocity asking for a ticket change to leave asap telling them my heartbreak. They called United, a wonderful young man spoke to his supervisor and changed my ticket with no additional charge. I can't thank United and travelocity enough for the kindness they showed me. Loosing another member of my family would have been too much to bare."
Oct 2019,40,It's air travel,"Typical air travel. It's crowded. My roundtrip flight were on time and sometimes got to the gate early.  All of my flights were considered regional flights. I did get free entertainment on my phone on a flight, which I really liked.  I bought economy flight so I was in the back of the plane."
Oct 2019,10,I'll never fly United again.,"In spite of an atrocious experience on United in January 2019, I agreed to an itinerary booked by Road Scholar for a round trip to Ireland. At the Dublin airport on our return, we stood in line for an hour and 20 minutes to simply check in at the counter. Only one person was working the line, which was 5 rows deep. (We could not check in online because we were carrying medical equipment.) While we stood there, we watched the line for club members being served by one person with a 5–10 minute maximum wait. Fortunately, we had allowed 3 hours at the airport, or we would never have made our flight.    When we arrived in Washington's Dulles, we were surprised to find two men waiting for us with wheelchairs that we had not ordered. We declined them and walked to the next gate."
Oct 2019,20,Packed in like sardines,"They have reduced space between seats an eliminated reclining. I am 6'0"" and my knees were pushed against seat in front entire trip. Hip problems since returning home."
Oct 2019,50,"On time, decent dinner, excellent cabin crew service",Yesterday my wife and I flew from Newark to West Palm Beach. The flight was on time. We were served a decent dinner in first class and the cabin crew service could not have been better. Nothing went wrong. These last two flights on United go a long way to make up for the horrible flights we had in June on United.
Oct 2019,40,Good economy flight,Love the fact that they offer free entertainment ( as long as you download the United APP to your device before taking off). It makes the flight go by quickly. I also love the stroopwaffles wafer type caramel cookie they serve on morning flights.
Oct 2019,10,Horrendous business class flights BOS-SFO and return,"I have flown nearly 2 million air miles over my life and career. United has declined more than any other airline with surly flight attendants, poor food quality, and a demeanor that would get anyone else kicked out of a job. I hate the airline. Hate is a strong word but it has disappointed me so many times, I hope it goes out of business. This last trip, again surly flight attendant, poor food for class and incredible discourtesy. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Bathrooms - yuck and even business/firt seats. I use hot towel to wipe down arms and tray table. This a $1k ticket folks! I only travel business or first. First if available and if not business. The employees and management of this company should be ashamed of themselves!"
Oct 2019,50,Munich to Chicago,"Very nice flight. We sat in the middle section of a 3-4-3 seat configuration. Surprisingly, we liked it better than the side sections. Food was good and welcomed. Entertainment in the seat backs had a great selection. Only down side was it was a 9 plus hour flight. Not much United can do about that though. It actually went pretty fast. All in all it was a great flight."
Oct 2019,40,United Airlines flight London,"Flight is ok, the airline is average, meaning it’s good but got nothing exceptional or special like other airlines do, they kind of deliver the very minimum to comply. The entertainment system did not work, not big deal but might be impossible to some. If you’re taking an overseas flight, I would rather recommend to take an airline from such country, for example I flew to UK, then use British Airways, because I also gave it a try and know from first hand the experience is way different!"
Oct 2019,10,Unprofessional and not worth the cheap ticket.,"united is terrible, and I keep giving them another shot thinking the cheap flight is worth the headache but it just isn't.  My flight to my destination - the flight attendant was even complaining about how trash the airline was right in the middle of the isle, in front of all of us. Which we know it is but I'm pretty sure you arent supposed to bash your own company TO and IN FRONT of passengers.  OnThe way back, which was where my review really stems from - I put my suitcase up in the overhead bin (which by the way is ridiculously small anyway compared to a reasonable airline. There's never enough room for everyones bag. Why have so many seats but no storage to cater to the same?) ANYWAY  I put my suitcase up and sat down. Two attendants came by and were moving my bag around to try to fit more luggage in (since as I stated, there's never enough room ) and the one attendant looks to the other and says ""I don't think we can fit any more in there"" and the other says snarkily ""ya, I dont know why people are even allowed to bring on pieces that size ""  1. How unprofessional. You are well aware that most people are able to put their luggage above where they sit. Meaning you know fully well that one of the 4 (minimum)people on either side of you belonged to that luggage and clearly had no regard for that.  2. The problem is the tiny size of your bins. not the luggage. The luggage was standard carry on size that fits perfectly fine on any other airline it is brought on, so if anything you should be expressing your concerns to your airline, not complaining about the fliers.  3. Even IF I had an outrageously sized bag and somehow managed to get it on board without someone telling me I needed to check it, you should NOT be talking smack about it in front of the passengers on the floor. You should be waiting until you're off floor to roll your eyes and and be rude about it with your friends or colleagues.  Their seats stay uncomfortable, their flights rarely on time and staff is often rude which is probably because they are miserable under their working conditions."
Oct 2019,10,United stinks,"One economy restroom was out of order from the outset and the others failed one by one until only first-class restroom worked. Halfway through 8-hr flight, the captain deigned to let economy passengers use first-class restrooms. Big of him. No entertainment screens worked beyond row 20. Cabin crew tried to reboot the system more than once, to no effect. Plane was hotter than hell the last third of the flight. My husband had to use his rescue inhaler, a first for him on a plane, which suggests the poor air quality."
Oct 2019,40,Cancun,Flight was delayed by weather finally took off Pilots did a grwat job return flight was a little ahead of schedule
Oct 2019,50,Premium Plus,"Premium Plus is a great addition to United's long haul flights. Worth the price difference from standard economy - for this flight about $300. Unfortunately it's not on every plane. This flight was a 777-200. Seat and legroom were very comfortable. Plenty of entertainment choices. Only complaint is they run out of meal choices by the third row. Flight attendants did a great job. This was one of the first flights to land at SFO around 6:40am, so immigration was a breeze. Baggage transfer worked perfectly."
Oct 2019,50,Comfortable and entertaining,"I was pleasantly surprised by the fight. I had heard that the service and food was almost nonexistent. This was not the case. We had acceptable food and totally enough food for the 8 hours. The crew as extremely nice. I have a hard time sleeping on a flight, so I really enjoyed the free movies. There was a great mix of new and old movies so there was something for everyone. Good job United Airlines"
Oct 2019,40,FCO to EWR,"Our flight departed around 20-30 minutes late, but we arrived 15 minutes early. The cabin crew was courteous and professional. The main service seemed a bit rushed. Our plane , a 777-200, was updated with the new Polaris seats, and they are very private and fairly comfortable. I really liked the memory pillow that came with the bedding. United offers a good selection of movies and tv shows, yet the headsets they provide are not noise cancelling. I’m not sure if the very front lavatory was cleaned when the plane was at the gate. After a good amount of fellow passengers using the lavatory, the sink and floor were well littered with papers towels."
Oct 2019,40,"Good service, reasonably priced","The flight was rather smooth and no delays besides a few minutes on take off. The pricing is always reasonable with united and a snack and drink are included unlike other cheaper airlines. My only complaint is that United now requires in-person boarding pass check in for anyone not bringing a luggage. Which seems like the intention is only to persuade people into buying a luggage pass, not a fan."
Oct 2019,40,Great experience as usual,Love United. Flight attendants are mostly experienced people when comes to such a long flight and they make sure you got what you need. Plane is okay but it’s mostly the service that I keep on going back for rather than others.  Thanks United!
Oct 2019,30,Decent flight but awful food,"The flight was exactly what we had hoped for and expect from a 12-hour flight. The seats were ok with just enough space. The attendants did a great job. The in-flight entertainment was decent, but the food really was terrible this trip. They also ran out of meat dishes and had only vegetarian meals left. We were stuck eating a vegetarian rice instead of chicken and rice and it was awful! We choose our airlines based on price and United was the cheapest for our international flight between China and the US this time but I’ll have to consider food options in the future as well."
Oct 2019,40,Great newer plane from ONT-SFO,"This is the plane to take from ONT-SFO. It was larger, more comfortable, space for your legs, larger overhead bins for carry-ons etc. What I enjoyed most was the friendly attendant and the personal in-flight entertainment offered on such a short flight. There was a rude passenger who cut in front of my pregnant wife and we exchanged words but that’s not the airline’s fault."
Oct 2019,50,Flight experience,Overall was a pleasant flight with no delays and mechanically good. Check-in was courteous and helpful. Baggage claim was slow no other problem The food was ok as well as the cabin.
Oct 2019,40,"On time, both ends Nice flight","very nice quick flight, left on time and arrived on time. Excellent service on board.  We even had excellent service at the airport from United, they took our luggage earlier than they were supposed to, we were at the airport a bit too early... Overall, excellent experience."
Oct 2019,50,United Polaris Business Class,"United Polaris Business Class is pretty comfortable with the flat bed seats. Given my height 6'2"", this kind of seating is very important to me for the long flights. I had a window seat and enjoyed flying the polar route. The flatscreen TVs are large and offer enough movies and entertainment to keep you occupied for the 10 1/2 flight. Food offerings are delicious enough and frequent enough to keep you well nourished. The beverage selections are fairly standard. However, the CA wines are pretty good."
Oct 2019,40,Comfort Class was nice,"Paid an extra $100/seat for greater leg room on this flight. It's a shame that it cost so much...but it made the flight very comfortable. Going home did not pay the premium and was very cramped with person in front of me although their seatback was all thr reclined constantly tried to push back further, killing my knees!"
Oct 2019,30,Get what you pay for,Video didn't work for my wife and the legroom was nonexistent...I'm a seasoned traveler and I won't fly this airline at this level ever again.
Oct 2019,40,Platinum premium upgrade,"United considers this their premium transcontinental business class. Complimentary Mileage Plus upgrades are not available, so it was a good use of one of the regional upgrades that I got with platinum status. I was assigned roomy window seat 1A on the bulkhead. It is a lie flat sea, but I didn’t want to sleep on a daytime flight. Enjoyed a good selection of movies on my large personal screen and didn’t have to rely on using my iPad.  However, the food was disappointing. All of their breakfast choices included meat, and the ovo-lacto vegetarian meal I requested was basically granola with milk and fruit, no cheese or eggs. Pre landing snack was a sandwich wrapped in plastic and the mimosa I ordered came as orange juice mixed with sparkling water, not sparkling wine until I asked about it. Also, there was no curtain to separate the galley, so the bright lights from the kitchen were in my face the entire flight. This was an ok business class flight, but they need to up theirs game a bit to qualify as premium. Best moment of the flight was when the captain came back to the cabin and personally welcomed us. THAT felt special!"
Oct 2019,40,Good flight,"The plane was Boeing 767, the legroom was more than enough, the meals were tasty, both red and white wine were o.k.  The entertainment: there were personal screens with good choice of moovies and music"
Oct 2019,40,DFW To Denver,Was very surprised to have a smaller plane. Comfortable flight with good service. Return flight was the same.
Oct 2019,50,On time and smooth flight,"We flew First class on our trip to see the Packers. Nice flight, friendly staff and on time flight. The only bad thing is when we got to Jackson they don’t have jetways so we had to walk like 1/2 block in the rain."
Oct 2019,30,TV Channel Choice,Turn off CNN and put on a real news channel.  Or just turn off the TV we all have cell phones and can get news.
Oct 2019,10,Fly with them ONLY as your last resort,The services we experienced from the operating airline were terrible. Some of the flight attendants showed us how much they hate their job with their attitude while on our flight to Hawaii.    About the seat and cabin: Wasted money. See pictures comments.
Oct 2019,50,Comfortable economy,Very comfortable flight...I managed to bag an aisle seat both ways. Food and drink were very good and plentiful and very helpful cabin staff.
Oct 2019,50,Houston to Sydney and back,"The United cabin crew tried very hard to please all of us. Several times food was served, the planes were clean, and we traveled a bit under the time expected."
Oct 2019,30,Israel Trip,"Heard a lot horrible of stories about United Airlines, well I would say not that bad not that good either. Flight attendants are first of all not helpful they will refuse helping you to put your carry on to the overhead compartment nasty not to me but to the elderly that needed help because first of all she was short and can't even put her luggage by herself, my husband has to help that fellow passenger. Food terrible, have to ask the food server to provide the lacking food on the tray. Restroom dirty. Unlike American Airlines they don't periodically clean it, they just spray deodorant to eliminate the odor. The only good thing is that the Pilot really have the expertise in landing the plane smoothly."
Oct 2019,30,United...you scored points by letting me take a carryon.,"I just spent two flights on United. The Dreamliner from Osaka to San Francisco. Then the cattle car to LAX. United, the Dreamliner is the top of the heap. Movies. TV. A place to plug in. (Note this will be important later.) And those cool windows that darken with no shade. The food was C-. And my seat mate got things I didn't??? Then on to my next flight. You keep pushing your app to watch everything in the whole wide world. However, we need a place to PLUG IN!?! Get with the program United. It isn't the 90's anymore."
Oct 2019,50,"Easy, direct from Prague to Newark","Very convenient to fly directly from Prague to the U.S. Boeing 767 was very comfortable, the food was adequate and cabin crew polite. When flying out of Prague airport you first drop your bags and go to the V.A.T. refund window. Then, after passing through passport control, you wait until your flight is called. There is security screening at the gates for each particular flight. While I am told that it can be rough and slow, ours was easy screening that went quickly."
Oct 2019,40,"Especially Courteous, Friendly and Helpful Staff","I flew Polaris (Business) Class between San Francisco and Osaka and experienced only one drawback — the cold cabin temperature — during this 11 hour, 13-minutes flight on a 787. The pleasant ground crew ensured a smooth boarding process, keeping passengers informed in Japanese and English. The inflight crew provided professional, attentive service, which I have often found lacking on United. My seat proved to be most comfortable with all the controls in good working order, and the cabin was well maintained. The food proved to be above average for United cuisine.    During the first two hours of the flight, however, the temperature was far too cold. Even my blanket failed to provide me with the needed warmth. A flight attendant helped me rearrange the blanket for the upmost protection and brought me another one. She talked with other crew members about the cooling problem and eventually the temperature was adjusted to a comfortable level.    Though no fault of United, the overhead bins on a 787 are exceedingly high for short passengers, such as myself. I had to rely on the assistance of others to stow my carry-on above my seat and to get it down. At one point during the flight, I saw a petite flight attendant stand on an armrest to retrieve something from a bin.    The flight departed and arrived on time."
Oct 2019,30,United 53 Zurich to Dulles STINKY! DISGUSTING!,"I took this flight in late September. I connected to this flight from another very early flight so was exhausted.  Seated in Business, I put the seat down to rest even before takeoff. Immediately I smelled a horrible smell in the seat in the area you rest your head. I won't disgust you with detail, but it was horrible and the smell was pervasive, even just sitting in the seat. I complained to the cabin crew who responded that nothing could be done, Business class was full, so no other seats. It was a long and gross 8+ hour flight. United promotes their ""upgraded"" Polaris service. So disappointing! Perhaps service could start with basic cleanliness. I was not offered ANY service recovery, just a basic ""sorry"". Oh yes, and they gave me a mask to wear to avoid the smell. Sadly, it did not help at all."
Oct 2019,40,Flight from Houston to Belize,"We were stuck in houston for 12 hours because of a tropical storm, The staff was extremely friendly, Pilot was great, got us there last minute, we only had a half an hour left before we wouldn't have been able to fly since Belize airport doesn't have any lights. The only thing I would change, It would've been nice if we were offered a complimentary drink since we had to wait so long, haha,"
Oct 2019,50,"Courteous, friendly staff",No problems with this airline. Flight staff were friendly and courteous. Nice choice of movies to watch. I liked they came around a few times offering beverages and snacks. Probably the only complaint I would have is while waiting for take-off the cabin is very warm and the air blowing out is warm until the plane takes off then it cools down; but while waiting it was extremely uncomfortable and I was sweating profusely. I actually got a bad headache from it being hot and stuffy in the cabin and had to take some medication to get rid of it.
Oct 2019,30,Good flight,We were flying from ATL to ORD on United Flit. #: 3408 which was being operated by Republic. We had no issues going through ticketing or TSA and through the gate.  The flight left about 6 minutes early and arrived in Chicago about 12 minutes early.  We were on a Embraer ERJ-170-200 (long wing) (twin-jet) (E75L). The United staff and the flight crew were efficient and friendly.The flight was smooth and without any issues. Even my one checked piece of luggage came through pretty quickly.
Oct 2019,20,Flight Home,Little to complain about on the way out five days earlier other than the cabin was very cold and we couldn’t check in online. On the way home however we were delayed by an hour due to ground traffic and the aircraft taking time to move from the arrival gate to the departure (which also changed albeit to the one next door). Once on board the unusual hand luggage and personal item measurements where on the whole totally overlooked by passengers and staff alike. Huge suitcases were being wedged into overhead bins so much so they couldn’t be shut. The flight was full and it brought on an air of panic for the cabin staff who were desperately trying to get the flight underway. Once we were in flight the cabin temperature was like a butterfly house which didn’t improve. Shame as I thought United had provided a reasonable service for the money paid. They need to either provide ‘guidance’ on luggage measurements or apply a strict policy checking anything oversized. I needlessly paid out on new luggage for my wife and I. I wouldn’t fly with them again.
Oct 2019,50,"very comfortable but, I'm 5""3'.","plane and bathrooms were clean and the movies played from take off until we landed. The service was excellent, we were in the back and the food was still warm."
Oct 2019,40,"Delayed, but automaticaly rebooked with success","United was delayed in SGF to ORD. If they left at the newly scheduled time, I would make it to the next gate just in time to watch them close it in front of me. Typically, I have had United not rebook me on past occasions like this. But this time, they rebooked me, gave me Economy Plus on ORD-LAX, and I made it early to Hilo. Flight 1004 is a pretty high priority flight, and I think United flies only that one 737 plane to Hilo daily, so not rebooking me would mean an automatic one day delay and another voucher. This was already a voucher flight from previous mistakes.    The only disadvantage is that I was rushed a little in ORD and LAX . Had time to walk and go to the restroom and that was it. No time to eat in the airports all day; had to buy food on the plane, which was tasty and not much higher than the airport."
Oct 2019,40,Fall trip to Maritime Provences and Quebec City,"The Quebec City Airport is a small airport with picturesque background. The full windows in the lobby allowed us to see the Fall color of the trees along the airstrip. United was flying about 20 minutes late. I was traveling with a differently abled person who needed a wheel chair to get to the gate and down the jet bridge. Getting to the gate was not a problem. We had friendly and kind agent push the wheel chair. We were assured that help would be there to get on the plane. My only concern is that given the delay of the incoming flight, the personnel forgot they had a passanger who needed extra time to get down the jet bridge. They did stop the boarding process to allow us the extra time and found a person willing to push the wheel chair down the jet bridge. All, in all it worked out well. I found the seats in economy on United Airlines very tight. The service on board was fast, courteous and friendly. I will fly United again as the flight to Canada Maritime and Quebec City is very short from Newark."
Oct 2019,30,flight was as advertised,"united was friendly enough, they departed and arrived on time, the scenery was spectacular over the canadian rockies and I believe the pilot made an effort for all to enjoy"
Oct 2019,10,Charge of baggage,I flew delta going to SLC I had 2 heavy boxes with tools my charge with delta was $175 for being slightly over the 50lb limit this was to be expected.  My flight returning from SLC TO SEA was unfortunately with United airlines.  I had the same luggage and was charged $420 for being over the 50lb limit. Take in mind my flight was $375. I will never fly United airlines again. Leg room is terrible and overall customer service is awful.
Oct 2019,40,"Two Hour delay, but received a $20 food voucher","Our flight was delayed 2 hours (mechanical and weather issues), but we very pleasantly surprised to receive a $20 meal voucher at the airport during our wait. We have never been offered this before and deeply appreciated it. Moreover, the pilot was able to deliver us only 1:15 hours late into Geneva. We always spring for Comfort Plus seating on trans-oceanic flights (definitely worth the extra cost). Seating was comfortable and the entertainment options enjoyable.  Kudos to United on this one!"
Oct 2019,40,"Flight wonderful, food choices not so much.","So I love United Airlines, they are my favorite, However, I felt the food choices were poor. They had vegetarian, spinach ravioli or chicken Thai. I asked if it was spicy.The steward said spice is a matter of taste. I asked again and he handed me the ravioli.  The really important thing is that they get me there safely. The bathrooms were clean.I'm just saying I wish that they had a plain chicken pasta, that everyone can eat."
Oct 2019,10,Stranded in Airport,"United Airlines - cramped seats - had window seat, passenger in middle seat was sleeping, waiting patiently, finally climbed over her and gentleman in aisle seat had to move because I could not get past him. Husband was not seated next to me, He was given last seat in back of plane, seat did not recline. Drinks provided, snacks. (cookies)  2nd flight, return 2:15pm – at Memphis Airport United check in booth, employees were away from ticket counter, having a gab fest. Finally returned to the desk. Both of us received boarding pass and seating assignment. Check in booth agent said zero to us for any possible issue. We went through custom, all fine. We waited at boarding lounge.  3:45pm – at final boarding, I was stopped by boarding agent (same Employee from check in) and asked if I had a paper coupon. Confused, again, I presented my boarding pass. She asked me to step aside. My husband asked what was wrong and she said my ticket had been flagged.  3:45pm – Agent told us I could not board onto the plane. My husband checked his ticket and the Agent said his boarding pass had no issue. I tried to explain that I had serious health issues, and I needed to board the plane, which fell on deaf ears. AC 7202 flew away without us onboard and left us stranded. They were very rude when we asked if they were going to provide us with lodging and a meal, and stated it was not there problem. We spent a very uncomfortable night in the airport, but were able to fly out in the morning, on a different airline.  After returning home, and contacting the airline, they refused to refund the cost of the trip, therefore my husband paid twice for the flights. We did have trip insurance."
Oct 2019,10,Delayed by Security Profilers of United,"Who has the authority to do this????  Greetings Travelers! Been flying international for years without much problem. However, trying to leave Mexico City on United, got a surprise being stopped by “their” security people, who obviously profiled me. They began asking a series of questions which became invasive and none of their business. More than once I was asked if I was a US citizen, which I am. I asked them why they were asking so many questions. The answer “security” and then giving a false answer to my question about why they were doing this. Something about TSA regulations which is false. I already have clearance. Who gives them the ability to do this isn a foreign country."
Oct 2019,10,Changed our Premium Plus seats to Premium Economy with no notice.,on 8/9 I booked and ticketed this flight for 11/4 securing 2 premium plus seats. This week UAL moved us with no notice to premium economy. I called the Elite help desk and the CSR was very nice but she was reading from a script. They are hiding behind their ticketing fine print. I'm a 25+ year United customer with Elite status. Disgraceful!
Oct 2019,30,United airlines the friendly skies Airline. I completely disagree,The service provided at check in in Seattle horrible 4 United agents walking around directing people but NOT paying attention travelers supposed to use the machine  I am trying to explain the issue to two agents it does NOT work because my wife was holding a green card and Thai passport our second flight was codeshare TAP AIR PORTUGAL from Dulles to Lisbon. I was trying to explain the ordeal to these agents  after messing around with the machine they had to do the check in for us which they  could have done. I could see the look on their faces unfriendly and they seemed annoyed as a result of their poor service they tagged one bag incorrectly and the bag did not arrive in Lisbon this was a complete nightmare. I wasted basically 3 hours at the airport filling out the claim our concern we were traveling the next day to Naples Italy from Lisbon and as a result of this we had to change the flight from Lisbon to Naples for the next day on top of this I had family waiting for us at the airport in Lisbon  and they left. This could have all been prevented if the Seattle Agents had paid attention and bottom line service customers. I am giving UA a 3 star but they only deserve 1 star also on the flight from Seattle to Dulles I order 1 sandwich using my United Explorer card because it gives you a discount oh well I was charged for 2 sandwiches. I am canceling this card and I will try to avoid United Airlines as much as I can on my future travel plans. I am very happy that I purchase travel insurance
Oct 2019,50,Uneventful comfortable flight. Arrived approx 1 hour ahead of schedule,Had an e-mail day before flight to explain the entertainment and films available.  So had choosen in advance with time to look at reviews. Thoughtful touch.  B787 comfortable but had been rather hyped by Boeing. In flight catering perhaps better than average. Another useful aid was the text to inform us of the Gate of the connecting flight.
Oct 2019,40,Good flight on B737-900 Entertainment control poorly positioned,"Good flight in clean newish plane.Staff helpful. Arrived ahead of time.  However flight entertainment controls on top of armrest poorly positioned. Wife unable to get to hers as largish gentleman occupied the entire armrest. Her other arm kept brushing mine, changing the controls."
Oct 2019,20,"Cancelled flight, broken plane, missed connection and overcharge all in one!","We had booked a flight on Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) 3 months in advance, and paid extra for ""SAS Plus"" to get more legroom and free baggage check. However, we had to fly one leg on their partner United to reach an airport that SAS services. Originally we were to transfer in Newark, but got word 2 weeks before the trip that United had cancelled one leg and we had to be rebooked, which was done twice. The final itinerary involved just a pondhopper to San Francisco, then we would board SAS there. Arriving 2 hours early to Sacramento, no one mentioned the fact that the plane was broken until we were already late for boarding. Then they first mentioned a delay, and finally admitted that the required part was being driven up from SFO, and wasn't there yet, and they really had no idea when it would be fixed. Most of us would miss our connections. My husband immediately got on the phone to SAS while I waited in line at the desk. 30 minutes later, he had managed to get us rebooked to a later flight, but how would we get to SFO? Well, United offered a taxi, and the taxi driver guessed which airline we were from: ""United, right? They do this all the time for breakdowns or overbooking."" With a rush, we were able to make this alternate flight, but now they charged us $100 to check a bag, despite our explaining it should be free. Of course, they gave the three of us separated center seats and now we were in straight Economy for the long flight, not to mention a diversion to Germany. No apologies, mind you. If anyone had mentioned the delay when we first checked in we could have made our original flight.  On the way back we got to sample ""SAS Plus"" (and it was fabulous, by the way) but were already dreading the United connection once we got back to the US, where again, despite having booked this 3 months ago at an upgrade, we were still given unmatched seats and no food. I hope SAS realizes that United is not a very good partner to have!"
Oct 2019,40,Non-stop to Honolulu,This is the third time I have taken this non-stop flight from Newark to Honolulu and I think it is great. You leave Newark after 8:00am in the morning ET and you are in Honolulu before 2:00pm. The plane is really nice and has screens with unlimited entertainment for each passenger in the headrest in front of you. You can also use your personal device and United Wifi to watch things. The biggest issue I have is that although this flight is between 9-10 hours each way United does not give you a meal because it is considered a domestic flight. They have food for sale but other than drinks and some snacks you have to pay for anything else. The flight crew are great also. The first two times I took this flight it was late leaving to comeback to Newark from Honolulu but this last time it left on time
Oct 2019,30,Smooth & easy,"When we arrived at O'Hare in Chicago, though the departure traffic area was unusually crowded for 0545 hrs. in the morning, the walk through ticketing and TSA went pretty quickly. The flight crew and UAL staff were all efficient and helpful, especially for that time in the morning. Our flight was a United flight that was operated by SkyWest. We left two minutes early and arrived in Atlanta about six minutes later. There was very little turbulence and the flight was smooth. The plane was an Embraer."
Oct 2019,40,Fly the friendly skies,Flight was delayed awaiting connecting passengers which we thought was great. Service was terrific and the seats that turn into beds were wonderful. I wasn't crazy about the menu but I am picky and my husband d and daughter thought it was fine. Movie selection was great.
Oct 2019,50,A1 Service,"From check in to dropping luggage off i couldnt fault united airlines personnel , no hassle and help was at hand , the flight was perfect and cabin crew were perfect with drinks and food all the way , woufld fly united airlines again on my visit to the USA."
Oct 2019,30,Ok but not better than American Airlines,"The flight to D.C. was ok, but the continual layovers really took more time than I expected. I understand that it was not United's fault, but San Francisco is limited in runway space. There were several delays (each way) and gate changes there and back. If there were some way to alleviate that, it would make the ride substantially better."
Oct 2019,30,"OK. Nothing More, Nothing Less","We really have no complaints about our flight. It left on time and arrived on time, which for us is the major measure of a flight. Actually, at least one of the flight attendance actually had a sense of humor. We see little of this on flights these days (unless they are on Southwest). Snacks were chintzy but this isn't a big deal for us.  But what ever happened to the flight crew providing just a little bit of a travelogue. it would be refreshing if they announced when we were passing over certain landmarks (e.g., the Mississippi River) and helpful if they gave some mid-flight information about the status of the flight (e.g., is it likely to arrive on time or be late and, if the latter, how much late. What did we get? Nada."
Oct 2019,20,Great Job in Keeping Standards Low,"The service crew (ground and in-flight) are indifferent, condescending and disrespectful. This is not my first UA flight — bad service and attitude run deep in this airline. It shows in the way they treat and (not) greet customers. If (lucky) you receive good service you can be certain that the crew is not born and bred by UA (and why they'd want to step down from another airline to work for UA is a mystery). DO NOT take this airline if your life depended on it."
Oct 2019,10,United Continues to be the Worst,"Failures on so many levels it is difficult to keep track . . But I will try. My flight was supposed to leave at 6pm on a Thursday evening and arrive at 8:25pm. As is typical for this horrendous excuse fo an airline, beginning shortly before boarding time, they started texting delays. Each twenty minutes we would get a new delay with a new excuse. They plane is late arriving, the crew is not in the airport, the crew is tired and needs rest, the crew is flying in from another airport. I figured they would just hold us in the airport until 1am and then cancel the flight (because they have done it in the past), but we finally boarded the plane. We boarded at 10;45pm, but the plane had been at the gate for three hours (waiting for that elusive crew). I’m sitting in first class and the seat back pockets are filled with the last passenger’s garbage. In all that time they failed to even clean the plane cabin. I am truly done with United, Spending my miles and going elsewhere. No customer service, dirty planes, crappy terminals, lateness, cancellations and a generally poor attitude when anyone confronts their reps. Truly the worst airline."
Oct 2019,20,The Worst Flight,"First of all, in order to be near my wife it was necessary to buy our seats prior to our flight. A new con that the airlines are now pulling. If you pick ecomomy for the best fare you get nothing. You can't choose your seat, can't take on carryon bags, no priority boarding and no cancellations. This scam the airlines are perpetrating is absolutley rediculous because the seats are narrower, less padded and will not recline more than an inch. Food is awful and you must pay for it. Coffee sucks but too bad. With all this negativity I must say the staff was great. That's the second star."
Oct 2019,50,Excellent service,"Gate agent in Denver, Noam, went above and beyond to meet our needs.planes clean. Very happy with United."
Oct 2019,10,Bad flight experience,"We recently took our bucket list trip to Alaska. We flew Delta Airlines to Anchorage and everything was wonderful. We were offered a free meal & several movie selections and flight attendants were very friendly. Our return trip to Boston was on United Airlines with 2 layovers. We only chose this because of flight times. The first leg of our trip the tv didn’t work. The next 2 flights had no tv. We were only offered snacks, no meal. When offered a snack/beverage we were told to “hurry” with our choice. On all 3 flights, all flight attendants were abrupt & never smiled. We have never seen anything like this before. Then to top it off, when we got home & started to unpack the next day we found a piece of luggage broken. The zipper was broken and needed pliers to open it. No longer usable & only a year old. And because we didn’t unpack immediately due to traveling 24 hours & being exhausted, we can’t put a claim in for damaged luggage as it needs to be done in 24 hours & they need to see it. What??!! DON’T FLY UNITED AIRLINES! We never will again."
Oct 2019,20,Not as good as others.,"I would expect that an airline as large as United would offer more perks. The flight from LA to Chicago is over 4 hours. Does this airline offer any kind of entertainment? No. There are no screens to watch movies or connections on the seat to listen to music. If you want any entertainment, you need to go online and use their website..and there still is no choice for music. Most airlines have the pilots make announcements . We were delayed on the ground for 30 minutes and never once heard from the pilot to explain. We went through some turbulance and never heard from from pilot. We flew over the Grand Canyon and the pilot didn't say a word. I guess i'm spoiled by the other airlines like southwest, that go out of their way to stay in touch with the passengers, I avoid United at all cost. But sometimes you have no choice. The legroom on their planes is horrible, so you have to upgrade to premium economy. Which of course will cost you more. Maaaybe they should offer customer service training to the staff and pilots. Go to Southwest and get some education on how to treat customers!!"
Oct 2019,40,Great service,"Thank you United Airlines for recognizing my husband's 26 years served in the Air Force, by waiving bag fees... If you're retired or active duty, let them know upon checking in. We saved $95. Each military person gets 3 free bags!"
Oct 2019,10,Double delay both arriving and departing with no explanation,Horrible customer service Double delay and gate changes both arriving and departing with no explanation except there was a mechanical concern it takes four hours for you people to figure this out with no explanation kids crying !boarding the plane and then having to gather your belongings and disembark the plane people in wheelchairs gate changes like it’s a joke. Arriving at the gate and then having another gate change
Oct 2019,30,Polaris is Downgrade from What Used to be Called Business Class,"Seats are OK, if you use SeatGuru to pick the right spot in the cabin. Staff is so spotty: Purser will be very cordial upon seating, but then you never see him/her again. Flight attendants are also sometimes great, often surly.    And there is simply no way UA can figure out how to get food and beverage service made in the same 5 minute period. You get your food --on a tray mind you, not as an individual service as Business Class used to be-- then you have to wait until everyone else in the cabin gets their food before you can even get a drink of water. Meanwhile, the food has gone cold. This is not rocket science. But UA's processes are rigid. ON other airlines, you get the food and immediately get asked what you'd like to drink. Each passenger is fully served before going on to the next. Common sense.    I've done this RT 3 times (six flights) in the past year (very convenient for connections to/from European cities) and the food and processes have not changed. Yes, same menu month after month.    Entertainment choices are very good. Screens and headset outlets sometimes don't work (my flying partner's situation) so you have to use your own device. But that works most of the time.    On time performance of this flight is a matter of record- look it up on flightaware. It has been essentially on-time 5 out of 6 times I flew it this year. The 6th time it was over 2 hours late, and many people on board missed their connections.    Except for the great connections, I would fly another carrier."
Oct 2019,40,Nice Flight,"I flew First-Class on a United A 320 between Seattle and San Francisco, and the only thing I didn’t like about the flight was its 6 a.m. departure. That required getting up at 3 a.m., never an appealing time for me. But all employees proved to be most pleasant and efficient on the ground and in the air. The pilot kept us informed during the flight and in San Francisco, where we sat on the tarmac for about 20 minutes, because of another aircraft at our gate.    Our cabin was clean and well maintained and my aisle seat was quite comfortable. I appreciated the dimmed lights at this early hour so passengers could sleep. I took advantage of the opportunity but it was for only a short period, because the flight’s duration was just 90 minutes. I cannot comment on the food service as I opted to catch up on my sleep. The flight departed and arrived on time."
Oct 2019,50,Premium Class on United Airlines,"If you have never flown Premium Economy on United, it is definitely worth the upgrade. I flew 13 hours from Newark to Tokyo last week and the seats were very spacious and the service exceptional. These seats don't recline but for the money, they are truly worth the upgrade, A huge upgrade from economy and should probably be called something other than ""Premium economy"". Its like business class in the old days."
Oct 2019,30,Average Flight,My wife and I flew R/T Newark to Phoenix to visit family. The flight was uneventful going down to Arizona but was a little better going back as the aircraft back to Newark has TV monitors in the headrest. The seats for both flights were very uncomfortable for the 5hr flights that I kept squirming around trying to get a comfortable position. The spacing was poor from the seat in front of me granted i'm 6'0. We took united only because of the pricing as I'm from Philly and the prices to phoenix from there were 2x the price. I would fly United again only if the price was right. Otherwise I wasn't to impressed. We left on time going to Phoenix and left a little late coming back which cause mayhem for people connecting. It was even to the point an argument broke out because people who need to exit the plane to make there next flight were held up by other who didn't.
Oct 2019,30,Ordinary experience but stuck waiting for a gate,"United did a horrible job handling the closing of the main runway at SFO    They knew months in advance, but did not advise passengers till after they took our money.    It was basically, you are on your own. No real options.    My flight to SFO was stuck on the tarmac about 30 minutes as well after landing."
Oct 2019,30,Not bad,"Standard food, movies, TV, music as entertainment, charger exists.Service was good.  Most important-no delays in flights to and from"
Oct 2019,40,Delayed to get HOME,"No Fault of United, weather delayed for aircraft coming from Chicago due to weather. the only item i wish they would be able to update the customers at the gate about the flight crews time to be able to plan ahead for another flight or arrange hotel if needed."
Oct 2019,50,Another Excellent Experience!,"We flew United First from Chicago to Las Vegas. The flight was a little over three hours on a Boeing 737-900. The flight attendants, as always, were fantastic. They are always attentive and professional, not just on this flight, but every flight we have flown them. It does not matter if it is economy, or in this case first class. A dinner was served on this 7:50pm departure of arugula salad and grilled chicken or buffalo mac and cheese. The seating was very comfortable. United’s onboard product continues to be great. Thank you again for a great experience!"
Oct 2019,20,"UNITED WORKERS AT NEWARK WHO OFFER CRIPPLED PEOPLE WHEEL CHAIR ASSISTANCE SUBTLY AND NOT SO SUBTLY, DEMAND TIPSE","Absolutely awful, these men and women who push wheelchairs around and drive carts for crippled people, expect tips and solicit tips in many subtle ways: e.g. repeatedly asking you if they did a good, if everything is ok, being obsequious and when you reach your destination they hang around waiting for money. This is a blight on America and Americans. United Airlines assists crippled people and then extorts money from these helpless passengers"
Oct 2019,10,Awful,"Sat on the runway for 3 hours prior to takeoff, and seatback entertainment was not working for the entire flight."
Oct 2019,40,Flight home,It was a super long 9 hour flight but we upgraded to premium economy which was a great move. We had way more leg room and they made the flight bare able
Oct 2019,30,The flight was over booked and if i didnt have to make a meeting time i would have accepted the ticket exchange,"The staff was very nice and helpful, the flight was over booked but that is how all flights are now. It is not that luxurious experience that flying used to be. Ita about shrinking the seat size and cramming as many people as they can to maximize profits."
Oct 2019,10,Not a good expereince,"A very poor experience. The Flight to New Jersey was 3.5 hours late making the onward connection very 'tight' especially as through booking of hold luggage was not permitted. Staff at Manchester very helpful and suggested that Cabin Staff would, if approached, contact ground staff in Newark to ease my wife and I through the transfer. Not so, I was told no help was possible as we were not flying First Class. In the event we just made the connection but lost out on the transit lounge we had booked at considerable cost. The flight itself was poor, food and drink provision awful to the extent there was no food, a coffee biscuit excepted, on the onward 5.5 hour leg to San Jose. The aircraft interior was tatty just about summing up this airline. To add insult to injury we are now told no compensation is due. I will never fly this airline again and avoid any flight which goes through Newark like the plague. I suggest United Management takes a look at Emirates, Qatar or Qantas to see what customer service can be like even in Economy"
Oct 2019,30,It got me to Ireland,We ended up in the very back of the plane. By the time the food services got to us we had very little to no choice for food. My husband and I ended up with seats that were not together. The overhead storage area was filled when he got to his seat and his backpack ended up many seats forward? We did end up landing early because of a tail wind. It seemed like a long wait for our luggage to arrive in the pick up area. We thought it was because we landed almost an hour early.
Oct 2019,40,Herded like cattle.. airline travel in 2019,"No real complaints, just the way it is. Airports are way too big, need lots of time between flights as gates are so far apart. Line up to board, sit in seats that are hard, small and crowded. It is what it is!"
Oct 2019,10,Don’t Trust This Airline,"**WARNING**  United Airlines books customers on flights that don’t even exists. Even if you have a CONFIRMATION EMAIL/NUMBER it won’t matter, they won’t even look at it. I have ALL of my emails I received from them. If you try customer service they’ll just talk over you, interrupt you, and tell you “I don’t know”  Here’s my complaint:  Was booked for flight out of SouthBend at 0600 (UA5330) and Chicago at 0753 (UA4289) as per confirmation. No info for pre check in sent. Upon arrival at SB airport, learned there was no record of me on 0600 flight (which they switched me to) and UA4289 out of Chicago didn’t even exists. Customer service agent at United customer service booth ABSOLUTELY RUDE and unhelpful, not allowing me to finish a single sentence and then telling me I haven’t given him proper information. I now have over 6 hours to wait in Chicago, departing 2 hours after I was supposed to land in Winnipeg, no longer have a ride home and will need to work on making other arrangements from long distance, and will be missing an important specialist appointment this afternoon.  1. I want to know how I can be given a confirmation for a flight that doesn’t even exist?  2. Customer service experience in southbend AND Chicago were horrible, your staff need retraining on how to listen and speak to customers.    Make sure not to count on the information on your confirmation with this airline-it doesn’t mean boo. Don’t make plans around flights with this company-you may not even be in the same country when you’re due. If you do, make sure to contact them to make sure the flights you’re confirmed for actually exist, and that you’re actually booked on them. DO NOT TRUST UNITED AIRLINES, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS WHO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO FLY WITH THEM. Feel free to share with others who fly with United so they don’t get screwed over the way I have. Horrible company,horrible experience."
Oct 2019,50,Very comfertable,We were lucky as most of the plane was empty so we had full rows for ourselves and we could sleep in our long journey.
Oct 2019,50,Flight 646 from Denver to San Diego,"The flight was great. We left on time and arrived a bit early. The meal tasted great. United was even able to make sure my luggage got on the correct flight as I needed to change flights due to severe delays in one of my connections. The only thing they could improve on was the seat comfort, but that was most likely due to using an older plane. Overall, a great trip."
Oct 2019,30,Still Lags Behind Delta - And Delta Doesn't Exactly Set The Bar High!,"It's not just their equipment that generally isn't as good as other airlines I fly, it's also their weaker customer service over the phone and at the counter, and their processes. From boarding the flight, asking for a change in seats, getting on an earlier flight, their website, it's just not as efficient and friendly as the other airlines. Now, the flight crew we had was good on this particular r/t, and that's always helpful."
Oct 2019,40,Quick and comfortable flight to Stockton,"United recently began flying between Los Angeles and Stockton. The flight from Los Angeles was comfortable. They show flight time of 1 hour 30 minutes but actual time in the air is 45 minutes so if you are lucky you will arrive early. If you have a normal carry on bag you will check it at the gate as you board the aircraft and you will retrieve it at the gate when you arrive in Stockton. I enjoyed the views of the mountains and valley from my window seat. A comfortable and relaxing flight, luggage will arrive within five to ten minutes in Stockton."
Oct 2019,40,Relaxing flight from Stockton to Los Angeles,"United recently began flying out of Stockton. If you happen to live nearby, Stockton is a convenient, friendly, and efficient airport. You park in front of the terminal, it takes only a few minutes to check in and clear security. The terminal while small is modern and comfortable. Be aware that you will have to check a normal carry on bag as you board the aircraft at the gate. You will retrieve the luggage at the gate after landing. Actual flying time is only about 45 minutes so you might arrive early if you are lucky. The flight is comfortable, with lovely views of the valley and mountains from window seats."
Oct 2019,20,Destroyed Luggage,We took a United flight from Portland to Houston 9/21/19 and our brand new large suitcase sustained damage to one corner and wheel. On the return trip from Houston to Portland the bag was totally destroyed. We wanted to show the airline the problem but there was no one working the baggage claim area. The bag was brand new and we purchased the new luggage for this trip. They charged us $100 additional because the bag was 9# over the 50 lb limit.The controls for the in flight entertainment in both my seat and my wife's seat were inoperative. Flight crew was too busy to care. We are done with United.
Oct 2019,20,Poor customer service,"Flight from Austin to Houston delayed due to air traffic. Resulted in a 1 hr 22 min layover being reduced to 20 minutes. Flight attendant ""mentioned"" that passengers "" might "" want to let those with close connection time be allowed to get off first but didn't ensure this was done. No passengers allowed those behind them to get by. I am elderly and have COPD. I collapsed running to next terminal trying to meet the connecting flight to San Jose Costa Rica. The flight attendant could and should have handled this differently."
Oct 2019,10,Flight From Hell,"Bad weather and even worse service from Airline, Houston got lost of rain, we were holding for hours, Finally routed to Baton Rouge to get fuel, We able to get stale sandwiches (not enough for all passengers (shared mine) Got to Houston Airport was closing, they made us leave secured area. No hotels available in area. Had to sleep outside TSA (a door as big as a triple garage was stuck open. it was cold no heat, uncomfortable seating, and little in facilities. I've had weather delays before, and united was always helpful, but this time, United personnel acted as if it was our fault we chose United. Maybe it was. I will remember this. Next morning found out they had overbooked my flight to my next destination and I was bumped. I finally arrived at my destination almost 24 hours late. My luggage arrive 4 days later"
Oct 2019,10,Flying the Not-So-Friendly Skies,"I recently traveled to Austin, TX for a nice weekend away with my wife. She stayed in town for a conference and I flew home ahead of her. Check-in was fine, boarding was what it usually is, but the flight and service were nothing short of garbage. I have flown around the world and have taken probably two hundred flights in my lifetime, but this experience was quite possibly the worst I have every had. While it is nice to have the TVs in the backs of the head rests, they bombard you with advertisements you CANNOT ignore as they blast the audio through the entire cabin and play on every screen with no option to ignore or turn them off. They play the safety video followed by advertisements for the airline, the United premier mileage card, Marriott, and several other companies, and it is abysmal to endure. After that nonsense, the stewardesses must have bumped into my chair and me a dozen times, and at least twice with the cart, without an ""excuse me"", ""I'm sorry"" or ""are you alright?"" Instead, the stewardess who nearly ripped the skin of my arm with the beverage cart looked right at me and didn't say a word even though it was very obvious she knew she hit me. Seriously United? This is what you call service? I can appreciate that my experience may have been unique, but I will NEVER be flying with United again unless I absolutely have no other option."
Oct 2019,10,Worst flight ever,Flew to Las Vegas from omaha - Denver- Las Vegas. First class from Denver. Denver to omaha- nightmare.
Oct 2019,50,"On time, pleasant flight crew",Did not clear the waitlist for business class and was ready for brutal coach flight but was surprised that the additional room in the premium coach actually provides enough room to find some comfort. Screens in all seats allowed for nice entertainment.
Oct 2019,10,Worst. Airline. Ever.,"Unorganized, dysfunctional and unwilling to compensate for their mistakes. United really can’t figure it out. This is the second flight in 5 days that United has royally screwed up for me. I will NEVER fly with them again. Would gladly pay double to not have to deal with this BS. Get. It. Together! You are an airline, not a concession stand run by lazy high schoolers."
Oct 2019,40,This particular flight was one of the nicest in a long time!,"It's always a crap shoot anymore whenever flying United or United Express. You never know what you'll get from flight to flight. Either the plane is dirty or spotless, the crew inviting or aloof. This time we lucked out (United Express) and not only had a great crew (both cockpit & cabin), but also a spotless plane (which was an older Canadair jet). We were delayed approximately an hour due to mechanical issue with the nose gear, but once in the air we made up time and only arrived a few minutes behind schedule. Our flight attendant was outstanding and make everyone on board feel as a welcomed and valued guest. Ah, if it were only that way all the time (like it used to be in the ""old days."") Only thing that's consistent lately with United is that they're inconsisent."
Oct 2019,40,Just another flight,"I was on the typical no upgrade, no changes, no seats or baggage fare. I guess I hardly like to fly any major airline except SOUTHWEST. At least on SW you don’t feel belittled because you bought the cheapest fare. Everyone is the same no matter what the cost of the ticket. You get one carry on -FREE , one checked bag -FREE.. seats do not matter, it is how fast you check -in or if you upgrade for them to check you in.  We opted to stand by for an earlier flight on Sunday for the return, which left at 6:15am. We made sure in Kansas City, MO before our departure that we would be able to do that with our tickets. We got to Denver and also asked the gate agent if that was going to be possible with the tickets we bought. We were told both times, YES. However! You may be charged a 75.00 fee for stand by or you may not, depends on the gate agent. Well being in travel for years myself, it has always been about what kind of mood the gate agent is in or how nice they want to be. They are in control. So our gate agent being only 2 in Jamestown, ND was extremely nice, however when she finally got an agent on the end of her phone to check, she comes back with a “we cannot change it.” I was beside myself knowing the flight was wide open at 6:15am in the morning and as a gate agent not able to make the change, she was not knowledgeable to make the change. My husband got on the phone with an agent after 20mins of holding and talk to the manager on duty and we got changed. Just know that when you buy that lowest fare always, always upgrade a few more dollars for the flexibility!! It is so worth it to not go through such stress. I did not mind paying the 75.00 fee, but she just flat out said, she could not do it. That is what a “real” agent is verses a “contractor” at a small airport. Not good! It is stressful enough to travel these days to be at the airport at 5am and to be told no, when you flight does not leave until 230pm. We had turned in our rental car keys and checked out of hotel due to the fact that we checked with two agents in two different airports before attempting this. We got home just fine, due to my husband’s diligence. Thanks goodness!!!"
Oct 2019,30,"Kauai, Honeymoon","In flight service was good. However, seating was much tighter than Southwest ( our usual choice) and the seats were increadibly uncomfortable."
Oct 2019,30,Flight changes result in a very altered experience.,"My flight was cancelled so I was put on a connection, Cleveland to Chicago to San Francisco with only an hour lay over.  Chicago to SF flight delayed due to the SF airport but also our flight was an hour late. In San Francisco I missed my flight to New Zealand. Not another one for two days. Too late to get a room I slept in the airport (a first for me) because United said it wasn't their fault therefore they would not get me a room (actually I would have been late due to them as well). I had excess baggage which was difficult carting to the other terminal as it wouldn't be checked through. Had to take an Air NZ flight."
Oct 2019,40,Flight 469 from Calgary to Denver,"The flight was fairly good. We left about 30 minutes late due to de-icing. Internet was good and allowed me to re-book a flight when a major delay would have meant I missed my connection. I wish that a hot meal would be served for breakfast instead of just fruit and a cinnamon bun. The seats were okay but a bit uncomfortable - probably due to it being an older plane. The only major issue I encountered was a little kid in the first class section. I really think this area should be restricted from little kids. Otherwise for the most part, the flight was good."
Oct 2019,50,Clears skies and an on time departure,This flight is delayed more than it is on time. This time everything was on time and we had a smooth beautiful twilight trip back to New Jersey. Everyone was courteous and it was a real pleasure to make the trip.
Oct 2019,40,United Air,"This was great flight with great service,  I have used in last February along with my wife and we both were vary happy with this United Air Lines flight both ways."
Oct 2019,50,United great service on time Houston guy here again,I fly united a lot on business and leasure. They do a great job from the start of checking in to the time i get my luggage.
Oct 2019,40,Bare bones,We flew Basic Economy. Both had middle seats in the last row of the plane with only 1 personal item allowed. That being said it left on time and got us there safely. For years we've been TSA precheck ...this time we weren't. Don't know if that due to Basic Economy fare or not.
Oct 2019,10,Ordeal,"There was a maintenance issue with the aircraft and we spent the whole day in lines to re-book. We were initially booked to fly on the same aircraft with just our connecting flight re-booked. It became apparent that the aircraft was not going to be ready for the re-booked flight, so we cued up to re-book again and found out that we were no longer booked on the flight. The gate agent found out that we were booked on a flight to Houston, instead of Denver. The good news is that our baggage made it to Tulsa with us; I don't know how. We arrived in Tulsa about midnight, when we were scheduled to arrive at 5 pm. At least the issue was discovered before the flight took off. There was a problem with a sensor having to do with the position of the nose of the aircraft."
Oct 2019,10,Broken battery discovered AFTER we boarded.,"Legitimately waited until they boarded all parties, had everyone fully strapped in and THEN proceed to tell us that the battery charger is not charging and that they will need to either borrow one from Southwest or get one delivered from DC. Causing our connecting flight to be late. I guess better found out prior to taking off than after. Southwest next time for sure."
Oct 2019,10,Very poor service,"We took a flight from a LONDON to San Francisco and back in September. First time with united airlines. The whole experience was very disappointing, from luggage checkin where they messed up our bags, couldn’t link my booking with my wife’s one. Took ages to clear check in which meant we nearly missed the flight. Then staff attitude on the plain was very poor. Understand they are busy but no need to be rude.  Door is of very poor quality and I suggest you take some on board. Hard alcohol isn’t free and they done offer frequent snacks on an 11 hour trip!  Even speakers you have to ask for them!! Never again!"
Sep 2019,10,Extremely rude staff at NJ airport and on the Aircraft!,"My entire experience with this airline was the worst ever!!! Very rude staff, you can’t ask for anything because they will bite your head off! Hated this flight would never fly again. I asked for a manager and they never can back, the colour man was most abrupt but I also found the staff in general have a lack of customer care. All I wanted was a glass of water and I was shouted at and told to wait to my turn!!!!!! I was coughing hard and no one else had asked to be serviced I was the only one with my “call for assistance light on”"
Sep 2019,50,Very efficient and friendly,We had our flights cancelled by the British Airways pilots strike 9th September. A dirty trick played by BA as they told us 15 days before we were due to fly. We managed to get in with United expecting to have to take what was available. The airport crew were amazing and made sure we had seats together. The flight staff were great too and thoroughly enjoyed the flight. Never again BA... United all the way.  Ps we still haven’t had all our money back from BA either and it’s impossible to speak to anyone!!
Sep 2019,20,"On time, but miserable","This was one of 4 United flights we took on a trip to CO and then SD. Integral to this is that United, unlike any airline we typically fly, charges $30 for the first bag checked by each passenger. This arguably forces passengers to carry on. We had intended to carry on, but the rub was, the 737 was 3 and 3 seating. The overheads only held 2 standard roller carryons. They know this and therefore keep count of roller bags boarding. Once they reach their magic number, all additional passengers (essentially the final 2 boarding groups) have to check bags at the gate. There was no charge for this, but then on arrival in DEN we also had to go to baggage claim for a half hourp to claim our bags. Which brings me to how much I can’t stand Denver International, made of two LOOOOOOONG terminals, so you have to walk miles, then take a train, then still wait forever at baggage claim because they have so far to go. It’s also the only airport o know of where security check is just one for ALL flights and ALL airlines. It is huge, they have 8 lanes, but it is still horribly long and uncalled for. Not United’s fault, but if I’m kvetching I might as well include this. As for the restroom on board, it reeked. The urine smell was as if it hadn’t been cleaned in days, and it was the smallest I’d ever encountered. I can’t imagine how a man of even moderately large size could fit or turn. All 4 of our flights were the same problem with carry on baggage, and we opted on the return to eat the $60 and check the bags. Probably exactly what United plans on. As on most flights today, the flight attendants were sort of friendly as they did their jobs on the airborne cattle cars that are the 737 and smaller feeder line aircraft. Among Delta, American, and Southwest, United is is my absolute least favorite domestic airline. It makes me sad because they used to be my favorite."
Sep 2019,10,Flight issue,"I booked my flight several months ago. I went to check my itinerary a couple days before and my flight time had changed by 3 hours with no notification of the change sent to me. Being late notice there were no other flights left or at a reasonable cost for me to get on. Based on my second flight time I was forced to rent a car last minute and drive, ruining my final day travel plans. United then stated they would refund me for flight and add a travel voucher for the issues this caused me. I have not received either of these."
Sep 2019,10,Always delayed,"This is flight 4 of 4 that my husband has had delayed. Number 2 of 2 for me. Why are there always mechanical issues??!! Maybe let American airlines or allegiant airlines take over for your flights to and from Flagstaff. Better safe then sorry, but seriously-maybe just buy a new plane or get everyone some free alcohol. Just save money and TIME and drive to Phoenix."
Sep 2019,20,Return flight,This was our second United flight on our anniversary trip and I have to say the difference in flight crews was night and day The Newark based crew was terrible. Maybe we got spoiled with the crew from a previous flight from Newark to San Francisco which was amazing. Flight attendants heading from Honolulu to Newark were very unfriendly and quick to pass you by. My wife started getting a bout of motion sickness towards the end of the flight and was told not to get up due to the fact we started our approach for landing. She ended up using the bag provided in the seat pouch. After getting sick the attendants (yes multiple) asked if the bag had hot water in it....yeah no clue. But when we replied she had gotten sick they refused bring her a garbage bag to put it in. Even when one had a bag in her hand they made a face and told her she had to take it to the restroom to dispose of it...yet she couldn’t go they before. Even on her way to the restroom she was asked what she had in the “puke bag”. Not one person asked if she was ok or if they could do anything. Just attitude and disgusted reactions to a passenger having a rough flight.  Really poor service all around on this flight. Only reason I gave it a 2 out of 5 is the entertainment options were really good and helped during such a long flight.
Sep 2019,10,Expedia,Do not book United on Expedia. I did and ended up screwed badly. I can't find out who screwed me. United blames Expedia and Expedia blames United. I'm going to make it easy and never do business with either one.
Sep 2019,20,Frustrating,"Boarded a few minutes late, after everyone was seated there was a mechanical issue. Co-pilot said it would be a few minutes. We sat on that plane as it got hotter and hotter for over an hour without an update. Then a crew member stepped into the cabin and made an announcement which only the first few rows could hear. We know the PA system worked because it was used for the first announcement. Sat for another 20+ minutes and another announcement which could not be heard by the majority of the passengers was made, this time someone in the first few rows with a loud voice relayed it. Ended up leaving over 1.5 hours late. Plane was hot, miserable and cramped. Once we got airborne we lost directtv and had no inflight entertainment other than the movies."
Sep 2019,30,Birthday Jamaican Vacation,"The trip from San Antonio to Jamaica was wonderful. Even the hotel shuttles to and from the hotel were on time, professional and courteous. All of our In Country needs were professionally an customer oriented by a Company called Amstar. They are in consolidation with Fun Jet services.  However on our rerturn trip the flight from Houston was delay over 4 hours, leaving us sittng in the airport in Jamaica all of that time. No one from United assisted us in any manner. While waiting my girlfriend brought some items from the duty free shop for her relatives and friends. No water, food or any thing. By the time we arrived in Houston, our connecting flight had left. United put us up in a hotel and gave us food vouchers. No restuarant would accept the vouchers, so we had to wait until the next day to use them at the airport. Wehn we went through TSA in Houston, all of the gifts we purchased at the airport in Montego Bay were confiscated, because the Duty Free shop did not seal them in the proper containers for transport to the U.S. It is now October and we are still waiting to get all of this resolved through our Transportation Insurance Coverage."
Sep 2019,30,Not my airline of choice,All luggage and carry ins must be checked and paid for. Flight was delayed. Flight attendants were not friendly and appeared irritated. Couldn’t use inflight entertainment because they did not have any earbuds
Sep 2019,30,NY to Dublin - Went well,"The flight went well. Although delayed at Newark, we gained the time in the air and arrived on-time. Return flight also safe and timely.  Economy travel isn't great on any airline. This was pleasant enough. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly. Food was typical economy airline fare.  No problems. That's the best one can expect."
Sep 2019,10,United Airlines Sucks,"Flight delayed cause they can't get their act together, I will never fly United Airlines again. They charge $35 per luggage and serve cheap snacks."
Sep 2019,30,ordinary flight,"Regional jet CRJ200. 1:45 flight, on time in good weather. Everything went as scheduled and expected, which is exactly what every passenger wants."
Sep 2019,20,Grueling,Our flight from Den to Clt was delayed multiple times. There were problems with the inbound flight. The A/C didn’t work well. This was a regional jet and the seats in economy are essentially plywood covered with plastic. Very uncomfortable for a 3.5 hour flight. We also couldn’t move around because of turbulence. We finally arrived in CLT after midnight. Rough.
Sep 2019,10,They need new planes,"I was set leave on a sunday because I had to work on Monday and our plan had ""technical problems"" and I had to stay overnight. They did not even offer any compensation for the extra cost for me to stay another day. Then i finally left the next day early, I thought I would be able to go work half a day but in my layover in denver the plane had ""technical problems"" and I was delayed again. At the Same time (it was on cnn news) they had a flight leave and come right back due to ""technical problems"". I knew i should have done Delta...."
Sep 2019,20,Our flight attendant wasn’t friendly at all,"I’m glad the flight from San Francisco to Ontario was only an hour long because our flight attendant was so not friendly. She never smiled, and as I sat down, she chastised me for having my arm rest down. I just sat down and someone from the previous flight must’ve adjusted the arm rest and left it up. In any case, I fell asleep and then she woke me up 3 times asking me if I wanted a drink or snacks. The flight was an hour long and so I could’ve done without the snack bag or glass of water and would’ve rather slept. The seats were decent enough but the attitude of the flight attendant could’ve been friendlier."
Sep 2019,40,An orderly flight from Beijing,"We fly many times out of Beijing and it is usually chaotic. This flight was so peaceful and organized. The United Staff did an excellent job of organizing the boarding groups and there was no pushing or shoving and that made my entire trip. We chose our seats late and my pregnant wife and I weren’t able to sit next to each other which should’ve dampened my mood on the 12 journey but we sat in aisle seats close enough so it wasn’t so bad. The seats were relatively comfortable, the movie selections were decent, the food was manageable and the cabin crew were polite and friendly so it was a very nice trip."
Sep 2019,50,United Airlines flight,"This flight was on time, easy to access, comfortable temperature and the flight attendants were good. It was a basic point A to B trip. There is nothing to report that is bad nor extra good, all ok."
Sep 2019,30,United Premium Plus on EWR-NRT was OK,"I recently traveled return on United's 777-300s in Premium Economy to Tokyo (NRT). I'd fly this way again for such a long flight, if I could snag tickets with a relatively small amount over economy. I only paid $300 more which seemed reasonable, especially when you compare to their Polaris class. There is no competition on the route for me as I have to travel up to Newark from Philadelphia and wanted a direct flight.    My expectations were super low for United's Premium Economy after reading FlyerTalk threads about the service. The cabin staff are not dedicated and don't do a lot to make the experience special. I suspect that this offering is on top of their normal duties and United are squeezing their staff even harder (the American way, I guess.) The flight back from Narita was slightly better in terms of service, and I don't know if that's because they expect more Japanese people on the flight, or it was a better crew. If you want a true Premium Economy experience for a trip to Japan I think you are best to accept a connection and flight with ANA.    Food, seat, entertainment are all improved over the regular United experience. There are mini footrests and a good recline which will work really well for people who are 5'8"" or under. If you are taller you'll definitely have more space, but the foot rest won't work. I say in a bulkhead seat on the way out which had a lot of space to stretch out, but the cabin crew cut across that space since it's just behind Polaris class so you may get bumped on a long flight if you are in the middle four seats."
Sep 2019,20,Rude costumer Service,"Poor costumer service, Plain rude when asking for assistance. Have no consideration for service members. Expect to have no assigned seats. Expect your family to be seated separately. Discouraged to ask for assistance."
Sep 2019,50,United’s business class Flight to Cancun,"The entire flight process was very smooth, from checking bags, boarding and the flight itself. There is a huge difference between economy and business class service. As long as we can afford it, flying business class is worth it."
Sep 2019,10,Software consultant,"This is my second basic Economy with United and I am writing this sitting in FLL airport flying to SFO. Both times I was treated like a 3rd class citizen, and very visible discrimination. They wantedly make you wait at the checkin kiosky. The agent was there chatting with another agent and knowing that I am waiting for someone to come and get me boarding pass, they just ignored my presence. When showed my concern that my flight is getting delayed, she said dont mess up with my morning. United agents very much became like monsters, helpless, I am scared to approach them with any questions. Avoid united."
Sep 2019,10,Judge Joseph E. Fahey,"My wife and I booked round trip tickets in April. We selected aisle seats due to our knee and hip replacements. Returning home our seat assignments were cancelled because “the plane was changed.” (See if you can figure out how that could affect a seat assignment) No matter how hard we tried, we couldn’t get an aisle seat even though we had paid for them six months earlier. My advice is don’t ever fly United if you can avoid it. They are utterly incompetent and rude. I gave them a 1 because I couldn’t give them a 0."
Sep 2019,20,Not friendly to Japanese,"This was my first time to feel such uncomfortable. Cabin attendants were friendly to non-Japanese passengers but not to Japanese. Well Japanese passengers might not be good at English and sometimes frustrate them. However it does not mean they do not say hi or bye. They greet selectively when off boarding. Took a look at our faces and ignored. The flight was not bad, I have not noticed such attitude during the flight."
Sep 2019,40,It's the little things that matter,They had blankets at every seat! That is a huge deal when you travel overnight. Kudos!    They provided snack and drinks. Entertainment was only with their app. I didn’t ask about WiFi and didn’t try to use the app. It was a late flight and I slept most of the way.    Thank you for the blankets!!!
Sep 2019,10,Basic Economy is a Rip Off,"Basic economy is misleading and a rip off. In the end passengers will pay more for baggage check, $30 per person. It is not worth it, book economy instead. It is basically the bait and switch and a money grab for the airlines!"
Sep 2019,30,BRING ON PROPER POLARIS,"789 Dreamliner makes for a, comfy ride but not so much if it's United aka Continental Business First Old 2-2-2 business class with discomfort and Polaris soft product Choose 6D or 6G the only 2 seats with their own overhead locker and direct aisle access as well as being Bulkhead seats OK food but ran out of champagne Don't forget to ask for PJS (they are not pro-offered)"
Sep 2019,10,Horrible United Airlines,"Departure flight was delayed for 4 hours for maintenance. The alternative was to wait at the airport for 14 hours for another flight. We were able to change our departure flight but United Airlines screwed up by cancelling our non stop returning flight. Luckily we were able to get a connecting returning flight but this flight was delayed for 2 hours due to maintenance issues and we would not be able to make the transfer flight. We were also not be able to get a refund for changing non stop flight to connecting flight. So instead we had to take another flight that's 9 hours ahead , which would lead us to arriving at our destination the next day. This made us late for work and the kids late for school. United Airlines should purchase newer airplanes to prevent maintenance issues that cause flight delays and properly train personnel that when you change departing flight do not cancel returning flight. This is horrible United Airlines!!!"
Sep 2019,50,Convenient nonstop Zürich-San Francisco,"Love United’s Zürich-San Francisco nonstop. It makes getting from Central Europe to Portland very easy. Coupled with a nice flatbed seat, good food and drink, and very nice service, it is my preferred way to get to the USA. Can’t wait until they put the new Polaris seats in the 787s. Customs and Immigration at SFO is always a breeze and United’s Polaris Lounge is accessible to and from the USA. It is the best lounge in the USA and has arrival showers which I love. So glad United offers this plus LHR, FRA, CDG, MUC and AMS nonstops toSFO."
Sep 2019,50,Mr D,"The flight going and coming was excellent and the gate people, flight attendants and the people at United. com costumer care for questions I had were excellent and very helpful and nice boath flights to and from Honolulu were on time and landed early so it was a very good experience."
Sep 2019,30,Least Customer Oriented,"Before returning to Denver, I had flown Copa from Costa Rica to BOS, SATA to Azores, Ryanair to both Porto and Copenhagen, then Norwegian to Denver. Copa and the European airlines far outshine United in every category you can name. What more need be said."
Sep 2019,50,"Smooth, and a TV to boot","The plane was on time; the flight was only an hour and it was a very nice, smooth flight. Boarding was efficient. The plus was the TV's which helped us pass the time. Wish the longer flights had these TV's."
Sep 2019,40,Better than last trip on United,"This past trip to and from Chicago on United was far better than previous trips. The flight crew was friendly and attentive despite delays and issues with our flight. Based on this experience, I would definitely give them another chance."
Sep 2019,10,This Airline sucks,This Airline is not a good airline. I understand things happen with flights but they didn’t notify me that my flight was delayed over two hours. Then it was two more hours that and they said our plane was at the airport but they were trying to locate the flight crew then an hour after that they canceled the flight due to weather which can’t be because the flight going to the same city that was due to bored after my flight boredom and left. So now I’m stuck and this airline offered nothing not even an economy plus ticket for the next day flight. Also when they tell you that u can have one carry on and one personal item don’t believe them because even though your bag fits in the sizer they might have you on a extra small plane and you will still have to check it.
Sep 2019,30,"The crew not very friendly drinks served only once, no food on a 51/2 flight had to ask for water.",Other United flights that we had were great only this one was a disappointment for us.  Couldn’t listen to the movies because nobody offered earplugs when asked for them it was an effort by the stewardess to give it to us.
Sep 2019,50,Bad to Good,"So unfortunately our plane out had a mechanical issue which delayed it 3 hrs which made us miss our connection to LaGuardia where we had a hotel booked for the night. Well United did get us into New York about 12:30am instead of 9:30 but we had to go to Newark instead of LaGuardia so they put us up in a hotel and gave us breakfasts, so although we’d rather got in as originally planned, they made the best of it."
Sep 2019,20,Isn’t United Embarrassed?,"It’s simply amazing. You would think that’s United would actually be embarrassed about the service they provide. First flight of the day taxi all the way out before they realize they have a mechanical issue. Back to the gate, deplane, transfer to another gate and plane. Land 2 hours late only to sit for 40 minutes because another plane was docked at gate in error. Leave Milwaukee on first flight out.....delayed because they couldn’t get bags loaded in time. Seems rather basic. Last 15 flights on United and only two were hassle free. Is it too much to ask a company to start figuring out their issues? First flights of the day should be 100% on time, weather permitting. United certainly charges enough for travelers to expect more from them. Lastly, why does United send a survey when they never bother to respond?"
Sep 2019,30,Returning home,"300+ passengers, seats very uncomfortable for a 6hr. flight, and service mediocre at best. Would not recommend for longer travels."
Sep 2019,50,'making memories',"My son, my brother and I flew to the big island of Hawaii. My brother and I have gone  twice prior, loving our trip, but this time sharing things with my son David was heart warming. He had never flown, swam in the ocean, or eaten in another state. Big fun and great memories at 53 yrs. old. The beauty is always unbelievable. It rained all day as we saw the waterfalls in Hilo. We came prepared with bright orange ponchos and thong shoes, so it was so much better for us than most people we ran into. When we got back home we read about the severe mud slides there, and the volcano's engulfing this awesome town we had enjoyed We knew we had gone to visit this beautiful place at the best of times. We all loved their special homemade icecreams and many special foods also. We felt rich, and blessed, safe and warm."
Sep 2019,20,Business Class and Kale for the Main Meal?,"Expensive flight; main meal was breakfast.  We have no food allergies so didn't order meal in advance. We were in row 3 of 8 business class rows. By the time the attendant asked us about our choice, there was none. Kale quiche or something from the pre-wrapped tray. My husband is a diabetic and hates kale; he found other things to eat but really? What irritates me is that United sent out a survey and I complained about this very issue and a month later I have not even the suggestion of an apology. If given a choice I would not fly United."
Sep 2019,30,Ugh Reagan Airport,"What a mess. They need more staff. Plane pulls in (arriving) no gate agent for 15 minutes. No gate agent at gate to help customers, leaving. No updates on why plane full of passengers is still sitting out there , gate agents over at another United gate saying.. “ that not our assigned flight, wait til your gate ag3nt gets there.” They never helped anyone argued who should be greeting it. Then a gate agent shows up runs down gets passengers off plane , then tried to board flight with a line of people with screwed up seat assignments.. totally useless. Then a crowded micro ERJ plane dirty nasty , no first class. Ridiculously small bathrooms , can’t even stand up in it. Seriously dirty planes bad service ..."
Sep 2019,50,United Polaris is wonderful,"Truly fabulous service. Michelle and Rachel were wonderful flight attendants. Even though I did not sleep on the flight, the Polaris gives you privacy that is superb."
Sep 2019,10,Never again!,I used United Airlines for my very first flight ever. Finally made time for a vacation. Worse experience! My trip was so delayed I missed my flight in Kansas and wasn't able to get home. I was stranded in Denver airport all night. Never again will I use United.
Sep 2019,50,Excellent airline,"Excellent flights, fab crew, great transfer arrangements in Washington (lovely staff , on board and on the ground)  Lhr-IAD flight fabulous- IAD-MCO very good and return!!"
Sep 2019,50,Unexpected Meal Served in Premium Economy,"We were pleasantly surprised to be served an unexpected meal in Premium Economy.  We were told these meals were only being served on certain transcontinental flights. Great service! Flight hit quite a bit of turbulence over the Midwest, but we did arrive early in San Francisco."
Sep 2019,10,United Seat Switch,Had reserved our seats months in advance but when we got to the airport they forced us to take different seats. I could not even sit with my wife. They refused to give us an explanation!! Never again on United.
Sep 2019,10,Flight,"Was unimpressed with the flight lack of friendliness from the air stewards, only given two drinks throughout the flight upon asking for another I was turned down and told they had given out drinks the food was disgusting on being had chicken and waffles I expected savory waffles only to my horror the chicken, diced potato’s,and veg had sweet waffles on the top with stewed apricots all in the same tray not a very good airline staff need to be aware of there attitude on board"
Sep 2019,50,A to B,"In my opinion travel is all encompassing, to the AP, at the AP, boarding, flight, travel to destination. Snap shot review.  Thank you Lyft. Excellent  Newark AP, needs help with TSA  United Club. Excellent  United AL boarding, excellent  United Flight, all good  Houston AP, all good.  Point A to B 😊"
Sep 2019,30,Pretty basic flights,"This airline is very basic. We flew to and from this location with this airline.  On our way to LAX we were delayed to due weather conditions. On the way back the attendant forgot to give us water. When I was about to ask, we were informed that the Captain had requested her to be seated.  The flight schedule is extremely limited from this airport which is a shame.  It is however amazing that there is service at all from such a small city and it saves quite a long commute to catch a plane from another city."
Sep 2019,50,Great experience,"On time and freindly staff every leg of our trip. Always my 1st choice in airlines! Getting moved up to first class was a pleasant suprise, thank you!"
Sep 2019,50,“Pampered to Peru!”,"United Polaris service to Lima from IAH. Terrific hard product in Business Class - this flight had the Polaris updated product. Excellent food choices and service on this Boeing 767: 2-1-2 configuration; if flying solo, choose middle single seat for privacy. I needed a few extra miles to re-qualify for 1K - found good prices on flights to Lima. Because it’s only a 6 hour flight, you won’t get the full Polaris long-haul experience, but it is comfortable and amenity kits are provided. A good experience and trip to a wonderful country!"
Sep 2019,10,Extremely rude staff.,"The agent who issued the boarding pass was very accommodating and pleasant. After that, the attitudes and service hit rock bottom. The woman manning the boarding desk screamed at passengers. The flight attendant kept admonishing passengers to ""please keep moving as the airline isfined if the flight takes off late."" We didn't even begin boarding until 10 minutes AFTER we were scheduled to leave. We were a tour group of 40 people, most of which were 60 or older. About 10 had some type of physical condition which caused them to move slowly. The plane was small and the aisle was very narrow. It was difficult to move without bumping into already seated passengers. The last passenger to board was scolded for being last. SOMEONE has to be last, and you can't board until your group is called. When the announcement came on that United was the ""friendly"" airline, the entire cabin of passengers burst into laughter. I will NEVER fly United again."
Sep 2019,50,Mexican Riviera,First Class service was just that. Top of the line flight attendants. The food was excellent and the seats were spacious and met our needs.
Sep 2019,10,NIGHTMARE,"I have never experienced more of a bigger flight nightmare than the one I did today with United Airlines. They wouldn’t let me check my bag on a flight that I made it on time for, and told me to abandon my bags. I refused and ended up missing my flight because of them. After missing my first flight the nightmare began. A light rain storm hit Chicago right after that, which triggered United to cancel mostly all of their flights. I was lucky enough to get myself booked on a connection flight to Grand Rapids and then to Newark, and I sat there for almost 10 hours waiting to board when FINALLY the woman proceeds to announce “we should be honest with you that we can’t find you a crew or pilot” AFTER everyone was already sitting there waiting for 10 hours! From there I spent hours on the phone with customer service to get myself a flight back to Newark, NJ as I have a dog at home and a child. Luckily, the representative was able to rebook me as a standby on an 8:45 am flight to Newark. I was the 60th person in line on the standby line and I had already been in the airport for 15 hours at this point. He then proceeded to book me on an 11:45 am flight to Newark with a guaranteed seat. I asked if they could offer me a hotel due to the inconvenience of me having to stay in Chicago for an extra night. NOPE. They refused. To top it all off I ended up barely sleeping on a bench in the airport in the freezing cold AC that they blast all night here reminiscent of a jail cell. OH AND I FORGOT TO MENTION that they misplaced my checked luggage this entire time. The entire time I was searching for my own new flight I was also hounding the baggage services department to figure out where they put my luggage, as I have my medication in there as well as my apartment keys. I told the United representative at the baggage claim kiosk that I have medication in my checked bag and I need to take it as HOURS had elapsed since I last took it. Wanna know what he said to me? HE LAUGHED. Extremely unsafe and unprofessional to deny a person their medication and laugh, all while not putting any effort what so ever into finding my bag. I waited by the belt to hopefully retrieve my bag to just switch airlines to a competitor. Wanna know who else was still flying out planes to Newark during the small trickle of rain? DELTA, AMERICAN AIRLINES AND MORE. United made it impossible for me to switch to another airline and get my money back, as they refused to give me my checked baggage, which HAD MY MEDICATION IN IT as well as my apartment keys. I’m pretty sure that’s illegal, isn’t it? United is a HORRIFIC airline. It’s for the poor people. They are the worst airline I have ever dealt with and what they put me through is INHUMANE. As I write this I am still sitting at the airport on the dirty FLOOR waiting for this 11:45 am flight to Newark to board. I have been here for 24 hours now. I’m not sure how this hasn’t hit the news, as it happened to thousands of people. Oh and I forgot to mention they left me without a seat on this 11:45 am flight up until the last second. They have been releasing seats to other customers and NOT me. The only reason why I got assigned a seat was because I hunted down a United representative standing at another gate and asked her to do it for me and questioned why it wasn’t done already. The customer service line for United was ASTRONOMICAL. I will be attaching that footage to this review. I feel bad for those that went through the same thing, as I know there were HUNDREDS of other people. I am exhausted, still don’t know where my bags are and haven’t slept in 24 hours. I will never fly United again and I wish I could rate this airline 0 stars. Aside from the airline, O’Hare Airport in Chicago is the worst airport I have ever been to. It’s worse than JFK or Newark. The line to get a coffee goes out the door of the building here. If you’re hungry, mine as well starve because it will take you 3 hours to get food. I was a frequent United flyer for business and I actually have a $3,000 flight to Finland booked with them for a business trip that I will be cancelling and asking for a full refund for. I will go book that flight with a competitor who actually values their frequent flyer business class customers. United will be out of business soon, it’s only a matter of time. They don’t know how to run a business. If they don’t let me cancel and get a full refund of my next flights, mark my words I will SUE them. They are a total scam. Horrible customer service. No loyalty to frequent customers. I wouldn’t recommend using United Airlines to my worst enemy. I am traumatized from this experience and I can promise you, I WILL NEVER USE UNITED AIRLINES AGAIN."
Sep 2019,10,Lack of seatback entertainment and outlets is unacceptable!,"I find it completely unacceptable that a non-low cost carrier today does not provide power outlets at each seat, only doing that at premium seats. And then providing no seatback entertainment and telling the customer to use our own device. I'm using my device thank you, with out being plugged in....I'd like to be able to also watch something like I do when I fly Delta or JetBlue. BYE United, never again.    And your food options SUCK!"
Sep 2019,40,Regular Flight,"It was a nice flight home. The service on the flight was very good, The one thing about this flight was that the entertainment system was thru the United Airlines App,there were no screens to watch on the seats. It was a full flight and an uneventful flight. We got in ahead of schedule. The flight deck was very informative with what was happening during the flight."
Sep 2019,50,Amazing experience,Amazing experience. Flying was enjoyable and fun. Customer service was on point and both aircrafts were clean and well taken care of.
Sep 2019,40,Easy flight,"This is an easy hop flight, couple of hours long. The flight was on time, which was good since I flew in the morning of my meeting. Cabin staff were professional and friendly."
Sep 2019,10,Horrible trip.,"I was on a flight with a layover in Chicago, the first problem, I was told I couldn’t take my small carry on suitcase so I was made to pay $30 I didn’t have to check it in. When we landed in Chicago, we were told that there would be delays, turns out that those delays were cancellations of the flights so everyone starts freaking out, everyone’s booking immediate flights, I didn’t get put on a connecting flight like I should have, my plane was supposed to land at 930 pm sept. 28, now I’m stuck waiting for 14 hours for a flight in the morning, with no sort of compensation, not even a blanket. 4-5 hours just to get a bag. If our bags are still going, why aren’t we? United Airlines has always been my worst travel stories because they just can’t get their heads out of their a**es.i would never recommend such an unprofessional, unorganized, unfit flying company for anyone to use."
Sep 2019,30,A very full flight,"We received packaged blankets on our economy class seats. Once this was a normal occurence, but have they redumed this policy? Anyway, the flight was full to capacity, but everything went as scheduled. We arrived on time."
Sep 2019,30,"Flight was good, service by United NOT what was expected!!!","This trip was a round trip from Seattle to Ft Lauderdale,  we were not allowed into their ""club"" with out paying the fee of $50 or more at that time. However, on the return flight it was the winter that several airline flights were canceled. Because we were one of the last incoming flight many affordable hotels were full, understandable. The cheapest was $550 per night! We were NOT accommodated in anyway!! My wife is a diabetic and had to beg to be able to go past TSA for food ( Only Starbucks was available) She was only allowed to go ONCE. We were stranded for THREE days sleeping on the benches. The flight and crew were acceptable, the rest UGLY..This was to be a ""treat"" for us, not the ""treat"" we expected!!"
Sep 2019,40,Went as planned.,Flight was on time and I paid for the extra space which was nice. Everyone was friendly and helpful.
Sep 2019,50,COMFORTABLE FLIGHT,Boarding process was on time and smooth. When entering the aircraft they ask people if they want to have their hand-carried luggage to sent to the luggage compartment of the aircraft. so that passenger can be comfortable is their seats and not to worry putting their luggage in the overhead compartment. Nice.
Sep 2019,20,Delays on departure and cancellation on return...,"Sept. 10, 2019, 9am was our scheduled flight from Nashville to San Francisco. We had been told prior that there were runway repairs scheduled in San Francisco that could lead to delays of 45 minutes to 2 hours. Since we were driving to Nashville from Knoxville because we got a non stop flight, we figured any delay wouldn't exceed the time lost if we switched to another flight that required making connections. The delay turned out to be FIVE hours though. One hour at a time they over and over. There was NOT a weather issue, yet this is the text I received ""Delay update: Your 9:00am flight from Nashville to San Francisco is delayed further because air traffic control reduced the number of planes allowed to land each hour until weather conditions and/or air traffic improves. UA2167 now departs at 1:40pm on September 10."" We hoped that our return flight would go better.....it was worse! Return flight on 9/16/19 was ""Canceled: Your flight UA2060 from San Francisco to Nashville is canceled because your plane needs repairs"". They then put us on another flight, going to Chicago and a connection to get to Nashville. We had 10 minutes to get to our connection in a separate building in Chicago, if that flight had closed the doors on schedule we would have missed it. Instead of arriving in Nashville at 5:15am as scheduled, with the changes we arrived nearly 5 hours later than planned, resulting in issues for us for our transport back to Knoxville. We had booked with United against our better judgment, but the direct flight idea won, and as it turned out that isn't even what we got! All 3 flights had issues with something, one where computer was down, two where the wifi did not work, a bathroom door that was sticking. We met others who were enduring delays and cancellations on other flights. When we arrived in Nashville and were walking through the gate, there were folks at two other gates who were enduring delays, the same flight we had taken exactly a week before was already delayed 4 hours. While waiting in the airport on our return, we Met a gentleman who had booked a direct flight from Newark to Oakland, only to end up with 2 connections that he missed and after 15 hours of trying to get to his destination, he was stuck in the San Francisco airport-waiting for another connection to get him to Oakland. ""Direct flight"" = bait and switch. We will NEVER fly United again!"
Sep 2019,40,The way a flight should be.,"An on-time flight is my measure of a good flight. This flight left 30 minutes late, but arrived only 15 minutes late, which only shows how much the airline schedules are padded so as to avoid a late arrival whenever possible. The other interesting thing about this flight was that at boarding there were 8 people in wheelchairs, but on arrival not one of them ordered a wheelchair to disembark, whereupon one of the flight attendants raised her arms and exclaimed "" it's a miracle--they've all been cured!!"""
Sep 2019,30,Bucket List Trip to Alaska Pt 2,"My flight from Fairbanks to Dayton, through Chicago, was long, as it was an overnight trip. Leg room was much less than Delta, and the planes were full. Also, for whatever reason, I was rerouted from Chicago to Washington, D.C., before coming back to Dayton. Not as pleasant a trip as the Delta flight to Alaska."
Sep 2019,30,Just a flight home after a long overseas trip,"Flight was ok, we never had a chance at a complimentary upgrade as this jet had only 8 seats up front. This one had the uncomfortable hard seats that some Airbus jets have. I got something at the airport for lunch since I think the United food for sale is junk and over priced."
Sep 2019,30,Just a hopper flight so short,A rather short flight to Los Angeles. They don't do a breakfast but served some kind of sweet scone which I passed on as I avoid sugar. Wish United would consider that.
Sep 2019,40,A very long flight home,"Our class of service was Polaris which is sort of business and first class but TA does not list this class.    The flight is long and the scheduled departure was rather late to leave so we ate dinner at the airport and then had the flight crew hold our meals to serve express style after we slept. We both actually slept the first 7 hours which was good.    Had the dinner, the Thai green curry and it was pretty nice. We skipped the pre-landing meal, the choices were horrible.    Flight crew were good, not as good as our earlier flight to Singapore but good enough. Plane was clean and in good shape."
Sep 2019,50,Kudos to the flight crew and maintenance staff in London,"I know people get disgruntled when their flight is delayed but there is nothing that can be done when maintenance finds a defect that needs attention. This was the case with our flight after we boarded the plane. The Captain kept us all informed and communicated the progress. They kept apologizing and handed out drinks and water. After we were ready to go the captain said he had more fuel added and we actually went faster than they normally do, cutting the delay down. I didn’t know they could do this. The plane wasn’t full so people could use the middle 3 across seats to lay down which is great on an 8 hour flight. I also like the fact they changed frequent fliers miles so they never expire. United is also one of the only nonstop flights offered from Chicago to Maui."
Sep 2019,40,Better than Expected,"Left on time, arrived on time. Meal and beverage service adequate...cabin attendants were helpful and friendly....baggage handling and check-in competent. The only complaint as with regard to their United lLub at the terminal...had two one-tiome passes...when we got there we ere told they were full...this after schlepping bags halfway around the terminal to ind the club....I did some screaming and they let me in."
Sep 2019,50,great,problem free with no hassles on booking seating timeliness. United is run like a professional airline not a rinky dink like Frontier.
Sep 2019,40,On time & Friendly Crew,Everything went well. The Jackson Hole airport was a bit of a scramble. They seemed very unorganized despite only having to get a dozen or so flights out for the day.
Sep 2019,10,No support from customer service. You have NO recourse.,"My husband and I bought a ticket at the ticket counter in Shreveport for a flight to Miami. I was quoted a price of $309 each and was ticketed to leave 1 hour later. When I returned home on July 27, I found it was charged an additional $275 each and when I contacted the airlines, they said I bought a ticket for July 23, cashed it in so I could travel on July 2. That absolutely did not happen as I stood at the counter and bought my ticket and left immediately there after. Further more, they said I bought the ticket online but I did not as I was standing at the ticket counter. They would not even consider my explanation and said, ""sorry but we have to charge you"". No more United flying by me. Also, ;passing the word to others."
Sep 2019,40,Mixed bag of entertainment offerings.,"All things on time and as expected. Transfers made easily. On the flight to Boston/Halifax we had great movie options for the screen in front of our seats. On the return, no such luck. It seemed they expected downloadable options good enough - but I didn't have an ipad, and don't watch movies on my tiny little smart phone . Just read my kindle instead."
Sep 2019,40,Late Flight Good Ending,"There is a caveat to this review because our small town is serviced by a United partner Sky West which changes the dynamics to traveling by air. Our flight out of Las Vegas was delayed because the connecting flight into Las Vegas due to severe weather...not United's fault. Our flight landed in Denver just as our flight home was closing boarding. The flight crew asked passengers to allow those of us on tight connections to leave the plane first, but it seems that nearly every passenger must have had a tight connection because they stood up in mass and blocked the aisle. Again not United's fault. After leaving the plane, we literally ran the length of the B Concourse to try and make our flight...from Gate 30 to Gate 86. Just short of our gate, the last call for boarding our flight was announced. At Gate 86 we found that the flight was at Gate 94. A little more running to find the ground crew was at the door waiting for us to arrive. They had delayed the flight for us. Say what you want about living in flyover country, but if that had been a flight to a major airport, we would have been looking for a different flight home. Thanks to all the United employees for going the extra mile."
Sep 2019,10,"United Airlines, You Can't Make This Stuff Up","Headed to Ohio from home in New Mexico for birth of first grandchild. With assistance in planning from a very good OBGYN we booked two months in advanced, Tracked weather for a week prior to departure. Received notice from United Airlines on day prior and on date of departure that our flights were ""on schedule"". Up at 0300, arrived at airport in Hobbs, New Mexico at 0500; all is well. Small regional airport with only one carrier (United) and currently only one destination (Houston). But it is closest to home in Carlsbad and that home for us now!    My wife and I boarded the plane at 0530 hours for 0600 departure; all is well. At 0610 we are directed to deplane due to two hour ""hold"" issued by Houston's, George Bush Int. Airport. Knowing we had a tight schedule and that the only flights from Hobbs are United, and that they only fly to Houston, we asked United ramp/gate attendant about options/alternate airports (i.e. Midland, El Paso, Roswell,Lubbock) that may have flights that do not have to pass thru Houston. She proudly informed me that ""this flight is going to Houston"" it will just be a short delay. Two hours later the same attendant announced that the ""hold"" in Houston was now a ""ground stop"" but not to worry, she had checked the radar in Houston and ""everything will be cleared-up in the next 30 minutes"".    It is now 0835, if flight leaves in next 30 minutes, with calculated flight-time in mind, we will still miss our connecting flight. When I inquire about this situation where we may not be able to get to Columbus before our granddaughter arrives the same United attendant told us not to worry because all flights were being held-up so our connection would still be made. Been flying for 50 years, that just sounded wrong.    At this time we asked to be re-booked out of another airport and was informed, once again, ""this flight is going to Houston"" and then she added ""and all connecting flights would be rescheduled"" and not to worry. An hour later the same attendant announced yet again that the ground stop in Houston was still in effect.    At this time a passenger in front of me asked if he could drive to, and get on another United flight from, Lubbock or Midland, TX. ""I'm sorry sir, all of those flights are now full""; obviously the 20-30 passengers that hadn't trusted her earlier had re-booked themselves and left Hobbs over an hour ago. When I asked her what she could do to help me and my wife she replied, ""noting""; you will just have to wait here.    Knowing that there were no other flights for today from Hobbs I asked about getting reservations for the next day, just in case she was wrong and this flight was not going o Houston today. ""Sorry, all flights for tomorrow are fully booked"". The guy sitting next to my wife stated as he was preparing to exit, ""yep, just booked the last seat for tomorrow myself; see ya"". When we asked if we could just cancel our flight and get our baggage off the plane the same attendant (clearly the one in charge) stated, ""well if you want to but we are not refunding your tickets because we haven't canceled this flight"".    I explained to her that she obviously did not totally grasp the concept of ""flight"", that being an aircraft, in the air, headed toward a destination. I further tried to explain that the ""guarantees"" of a flight going to Houston were not realistic and that we really just needed to get to Columbus, Ohio, not Houston. I again asked, ""can you please check and see what is available from some other airport?"" ""I can not"" was all we got. By now a very nice TSA agent came over and in almost a whisper (as if somewhat intimidated by the United employee) stated, ""this happens all the time here"", and went on to suggest we call another airline and try El Paso or Roswell.    We canceled. It took another hour for United to get us our luggage and four hours to drive to El Paso, TX where American Airlines had some lovely first class seats available and waiting to fly us to Columbus, Ohio. Long day but thanks to American Airlines we made it in time to see our son and daughter-in-law before she went into labor.    Many of us on this site travel frequently and understand, you can't control the weather but that is no excuse for not trying to help your passengers. Not that it makes a real difference but I find it somewhat humorous now, we are actually United Airlines Elite Level Frequent Flyers. Safe trips to all and remember, life is much more entertaining when you travel and you really cannot make this stuff up."
Sep 2019,40,Much better than expected,"I was pretty impressed with United. Polaris business class on the 787 was very good, and the staff were friendly and helpful"
Sep 2019,50,One Time & Friendly Staff,United really seem to be trying and they are now good at communicating on the ground and by text etc. Food is standard airline fayre but it does the job. Premium Economy seats do give you that little extra space and that is always good. Silver status on the frequent flyer status is not easy to get for a UK but is worth having. Overall this is my airline of preference when visiting the US as they have a comprehensive timetable and good times
Sep 2019,40,Good Flight in Acceptable Seat,"We flew Premium Plus from Dublin to Newark on a new Boeing 787-10. Takeoff, cruising, and landing were smooth and comfortable and the seats are comfortable, too, but not large and only tilt back a little. It isn’t possible to sleep comfortably on overnight flights with this configuration. Food was reasonably good except for a very strange, stone cold, lump of porridge apparently made with coconut milk and mangoes. Fortunately there were other things to eat for breakfast. We took off a little late but, nevertheless, landed a little early. Passengers should be aware that American immigration at the Dublin airport doesn't open until 7. I didn't know that and had to stand in line for about 25 minutes."
Sep 2019,10,Really bad experience with UA,"We looeked forward to enjoy our good 5hrs flight in firts Class to SF. But our disssapointment of this flight grew every flight minute. There was no entertainmentsystem / no screen on board. The food was awful and the at the end we got a damaged suitcase, and the customer service in den Baggage claim aerea of UA wa catastrophic. Never agian with UA"
Sep 2019,40,Very good flights,Flights both ways left on time. Leg room was adequate but not over generous. Service from cabin crew was very good and they were all very pleasant. Gave four stars instead of five as the food on the flight was awful. Even overheard one of the cabin crew tell a passenger they bring their own meals on board. Would certainly use United again as I think we all accept that meals on flights are pretty hit or miss.
Sep 2019,10,Musicians beware,"United airlines how can I say this, treats those who choose to shop for low price airfare and therebye fly economy like we are second class citizens. The attitude shown to my wife and I started with the baggage check and was reflected by the entire flight staff. From the minute I informed the baggage check in attendant that I was not going to be checking my guitar nor ukulele. Even though one was my carry on and the other my wifes reminding us of our choice to buy economy tickets. When I insisted on carrying them on was charged $60 dollars. Then phoned ahead to advise the flight crew of my decision. When we boarded the plane we were again reminded to buy an upgraded airfare ticket and even though i paid extra asked me to check my twelve string acoustic saying it wouldn't fit overhead. Well when I got to my seat not only did the ukulele fit under my seat there was enough room over head for multiple 12string guitars and several bags. Not to mention the flight was not even booked to capacity. The only problem was I had an economy ticket. But that is just the start. The plane took off then half hour later had to turn around due to tech problems with there communications radio's and flew back for the repair leaving everyone on board while they spent 2 hours fixing the issue. And offered to allow no one the option to stretch or deb ok ard the aircraft. When they finally did we dodnt even get off the plane when they told use it was fixed and ran everyone that managed to get off back on. There we sat for another 35 minutes waiting for paperwork to be filled out. So we were told. Of course we missed our connecting flight and had to be rebooked on another flight. Overall an additional 6 hours was the result. Not so much as an honest apology from flight staff. Oh they apologized alright but you know when someone means it and someone says it because they are supposed to say it. This entire experience has not been an isolated thing as more than just out flight was delayed for maintenance related issues that day as we learned from others rebooked on a different flight ending in detroit. United as I recall was a source of aggravation for me 30 years ago and again in 97 and this time. So three strikes and united, your out! You will have to pay me to fly United again and I'm talking first class with complimentary champagne. RUDE!  Paul Jaskierny  Straight line marble  360 909 3648  Go ahead give me a call I'm looking to tell as many people as possible as I have had enough piss pour treatment from large corporate entities. I do matter and as a business owner myself for the last 20 years I know what it means to be appreciated and how to show my appreciation for my clients big and small."
Sep 2019,40,Upgraded to Economy Plus,We were upgraded to economy plus for no extra charge which was much appreciated. Flight was on time and we arrived a little early which was a bonus. No meals included but you could buy food if you were hungry. However this was not cheap. Non alcoholic drinks were complimentary with 2 drinks services provided during the 5 hour flight. Leg room got the economy plus appeared to be less than what we have previously experienced. In flight entertainment was excellent.
Sep 2019,40,Good Flight,Flight was on time. Seats were comfortable. Cabin service was excellent with meals that were ok for airline food and food was piping hot. Plenty of opportunities for obtaining drinks which were complimentary. In flight entertainment was excellent which you could either view on the large seat back screen or on your own personal device.
Sep 2019,50,What a handsome and beautiful flight attendants; loved just looking at them!,The price was unbelievable and is the reason I booked it right away...just $326 round-trip Maui to Las Vegas!!!
Sep 2019,20,As usual the worst airline,As always no service for what you pay for ! I am platinum members but I don’t see any difference !! I travel as well all over to Asia ! Tokyo Singapore when I am lucky I travel with ANA impeccable service and premium économie is premium service food and seat  United is nothing of all except front raw and no drink no food
Sep 2019,50,Nice Domestic First Class,I flew with my 90 year old mother. Staff extremely personable. I fly both United and Hawaiian and prefer the United product more.
Sep 2019,30,Flight attendant,"one of the flight attendants ( tall woman,very short hair in glasses, there were only two in economy class) got upset because I used the bathroom as soon as boarding the plane. She said to the other attendant why people cant go to the wash room before boarding... This is absolutely unacceptable. I think we have the right to use the washroom or any other facility as soon as stepping into the plane as we have paid for these services. without knowing the facts/reason these women should not be passing comments to manner., They should be trained with better customer service skills or they should not be hired. As it is UA has a bad reputation. I was a wheelchair passenger but this should not matter. It is our right! As for me I will think twice flying UA. This woman should be reprimanded."
Sep 2019,40,Newer Plane - Nice Flight,"My wife and I were taking a trip to Belgium on a newer United Boeing 787, which we have never traveled on before. We were in the upgraded economy section and I was in an aisle seat and was lucky to have an empty seat middle seat next to me. Made all the difference for the 7 hour overnight trip. In flight entertainment was also excellent. Flight crew were friendly and helpful. Food was the usually airplane food that United needs to keep working on.    Newark is not the easiest airport to get into but once we got to the counter, the United staff quickly got us checked in and bags tagged. Only negative was the flight left at 6:30 pm and arrived in Brussels at 7:30 am Belgium time which makes it 1:30 am our time. Tough for us to reset our body clocks. We prefer later overnight flights so we are able to get more sleep before we land.    All in all, thumbs up for the flight."
Sep 2019,30,Not as good as expected,"Paid over $1300 for one way ticket (1st class), but couldn't even use the Newark business lounge. Not as good as expected."
Sep 2019,40,Another good experience,Business class with individually configured seating ... quite comfortable. Dublin business lunge was good. But Newark Polar business lunge is even better
Sep 2019,40,good experience overll,"Overall quite good experience. However, changes from Manchester to Ediburg was not quite smooth ... had to wait until the last minutes for the gate ... and charges $$ even for coffee on the short flight"
Sep 2019,40,on time and uneventful,"Hard to find fault if the flight departed and arrived on time, was uneventful, and had the extra legroom of Economy +. No complaints and i appreciate the professionalism of the entire UA staff to make the flight comfortable. Well done, United."
Sep 2019,30,Average Flight to LAX,"This review is based on a business class ticket to Lax. The plane was old, business class seat was tired, the cushion was sinking, but there was enough space for my stuff. I had my own TV with decent entertainment options, however my son was sitting coach and complained because they did not have screens. You had to download the United App and watch on your phone. Very disappointing. Food was really bad in business class and the service was blah. Some staff members were excellent and others were just very tired. I asked for water three times before somebody got it to me.The bathroom was just disgusting. The floor was sticky and there were old urine stains all over. I hope United improves its planes and service since I am a United frequent flyer."
Sep 2019,40,Denver to LHR,Everything was on time and well done. The 787 Dreamliner is the most comfortable plane for long flights. Food ok.
Sep 2019,50,What a huge difference between United airlines and American.,"We had to fly to NC and refused to fly American Airlines. I would go by boat before using that airline ever again. Anyway, I was hesitant with going United Airlines’s because of our experience on American (yes, I know irrational). When it isn’t Hawaiian airlines I trust no one😭 I was pleasantly shocked! They were amazing. We just NC after a heartbreaking time with doctors, so I needed some TLC. Not only were the seats like soft clouds (that reclined and had a massage feature) the flight attendants spoke to us professionally yet made us feel like we were old friends. They never sat down or stopped checking on any of us in first class. Remind you, we live in Hawaii, it’s a 6.5 hour flight from Denver. I don’t know when the flight attendants ever sat down. The were the best!! The flight was a 10++. After everything we had been through on this trip United Airlines gave us a wonderful ride home. Thank you so very much 💕💕🌺"
Sep 2019,10,"Bad service, terrible airline!","Friday 09/09, we missed flight UA62 to Sao Paulo due to the delay on flight UA 942 (bad weather in Houston). After the delays, the airline informed passengers to go to the front desk to be relocated. At approximately 11:30 pm, we were met by Mr. Martelo, who to get rid of us and our problem, told us that we were relocated on AA flight 21/09 at 5:43 am to MIA, after following to GRU by Latam on the same date at 07:00 pm. We stayed at Houston airport from 11:30 pm on 9/20, until the early morning of 9/21, when on boarding AA, Agent Marina would not let us board because Mr. Martelo did not inform us that Latam had not confirmed our flight and that if we fly to Miami, we ran the risk of not flying on the same date to GRU and the problem would no longer be United. She ripped our boarding passes and told us to come back to United to settle directly with them. We walked from one ticket counter to another at United and found only grumpy and obnoxious agents who, instead of providing help, made us more distressed and nervous. In one last attempt, we got an agent willing to help us. She got two seats on the same UA 62 flight to GRU on 9/21. If there was a place on this flight, why didn't Mr. Martelo immediately make our reservations the night before, saving us from sleeping one night at Houston airport on such distress?? From the ticket counter as on the plane, the United agents and FA were very arrogant. That's not the way to treat your customers(very poor customer service ).I would like to know if the upgrade I had on the GRU flight I missed will be reimbursed, since on 9/21 we didn't travel in the same category.  This was the first and last time flying with UA.  Nevermore!!!!"
Sep 2019,50,Great Service on a 14 hour flight,Took both ways from Newark to Tokyo. A very long flight yet the cabin crew was great. Attentive but not overly so. Great service on a essentially 2day flight.
Sep 2019,10,World's worst airline,"Wish I could rate 5 NEGATIVE STARS here... United has been notorious for bad service, after our flight from London to US, I can confirm that it's 100% true -- United really has the worst customer service and cabin quality in the industry!!! The United check-in counter staff in London Heathrow Airport had terrible customer service. The supervisor, Robert Stevens, treated customers rudely in an unacceptable and unprofessional manner when handling requests with medical needs. This is the first time I felt insulted and discriminated by an airline employee. It is a pity that United has allowed its employees to treat customers this way, which would actually hurt its business immensely in a long run.    As for other aspects of the flight experiences, the entertaiment system was down almost the whole time during our 8 hours flight (see attached photos). The cabin was not clean, especially the restrooms. The blankets were very thin and gross with hairs on it. On a side note, for those with tree nuts allergy, you need to be very careful that they serve meals containing cashew nuts (in our flight, it's curry chicken with rice). My son has severe tree nuts allergy and almost ate it...    I deeply regret that I chose United for my family's first Europe trip and strongly suggest that you should avoid taking this airline at all costs!"
Sep 2019,10,The absolute worst.,I loath United. They are such crooks. The worst policies and the most-restrictive fares. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
Sep 2019,40,Read the fine print,"Read the fine print. You do not save any money using basic economy if you have more than a purse. Baggage fees are charged both ways. Ended up paying more for baggage than an upgraded ticket. Carry on is laptop or purse. So, if you need more than your wallet, pay the extra and get an upgraded ticket. Other than pricing, the service and flight were uneventful and standard. But, it was 100,000% better than spirit air."
Sep 2019,40,Newark to Lisbon flight,Very smooth check in at Newark airport.Waiting for boarding at the United lounge enhanced the experience.Upon arrival in Lisbon the plane didn’t docked directly at the terminal.We had to board a bus that took about 15 minutes to reach the terminal..Not pleasant.
Sep 2019,30,Disappointed,The plane seemed very old and worn. Uncomfortable seats. They let people bring huge carry ons and ran out of room in the over head bins. My daughter and I checked in together early and we weren't even seated together. Won't fly with them again!!
Sep 2019,50,"Attentive, friendly staff",A reasonably priced flight. Upgrading to Premium Economy was expensive but we thought it was worth it. to have that extra space on an intercontinental flight is better for the body!  I thought the variety of media to watch was excellent. The food was palatable. The chairs comfortable. I would definitely fly with them again.
Sep 2019,50,Fabulous Experience,"The flight was fabulous. This was my first flight since 2001 and my first overseas flight. Everyone was kind and helpful. The flight attendances were attentive and concerned for my comfort. They paid special attention to me since I was flying alone. The ""pods"" were comfortable and had generous space."
Sep 2019,40,Roundtrip AMS-EWR-IAD-AMS,"We flew with a company of three from AMS-EWR on Sep.3. United offered us a free upgrade to Economy Premium in order to travel together. Excellent flight and services on board. Our flight back via IAD was scheduled tight but perfect in time, we can only say that United delivers according to expectation!"
Sep 2019,40,Improved United Airlines - domestic flights,"The experience with UA this trip was by far much better than the past, they really listened to the passengers - did they? Whatever the case maybe, I could tell that it was way better than before! Service was great, food was not bad and price seemed acceptable, better cockpit, and entertainments.  The international flights still need more work though. Food was still terrible and service still under standard. We’ll see..... I’ll be flying UA for International flight in December. Stay tune."
Sep 2019,10,terrible airline,"I am a frequent flyer, domestic and international, I have taken multiple flights with different airlines for both leisure and work related trips in the last 5 years and I have witnessed united's decline in service but this was, so far, the worst experience. A real 12 hour torture!. Sadly United has become the worst airline possible. Poor cabin service, uneatable food, the most uncomfortable seats and pathetic entertaining options. In summary, the worst airline you can travel with. Any airline, even the smallest and budget airline from 3rd world countries, will treat you better, will have more comfortable aircrafts and overall will provide a much better service."
Sep 2019,50,Awesome!,"We usually fly Delta. Occasionally, hub gets upgraded to first class, and being the great guy that he is, he always, always lets me enjoy it (even tho I say we can take turns). But this time, hub surprised me on two fronts: first flying directly into Palm Springs (we usually fly to LAX then drive the minimum two hours (usually three or so) out to Palm Springs, and second, he bought me a first class ticket. My flight out of Cincy was at 7:00, so I wasn't ready for a cocktail, but I did get coffee, juice, and later a nice breakfast. Our layover in Denver wasn't bad--United texts you updates about into which gate you will arrive and where you need to depart--Delta doesn't do that as far as I know, unless there's a problem. We sat for a little extra time in Denver, as it became obvious we were waiting on connecting passengers. I didn't mind--I was in First Class! I did have a drink then and the attendant was just as nice and attentive as could be. BTW, First Class people get some great goodies. We actually got yogurt-based, triple-berry muffins that had been beautifully warmed--absolutely DELICIOUS! I couldn't have enjoyed it more!"
Sep 2019,50,Words Are Not Enough,"The food, service, kindness, and friendliness were outstanding and a great way to start a long weekend. This was the best airline experience I have had! The flight attendant was friendly and helpful but not overly so. The food - wow what a great breakfast!!"
Sep 2019,20,"I’m pretty short, but.....","I’m pretty short, so usually legroom isn’t too much of a problem. This flight, however, was by far the most cramped I have ever been on a flight!! I dropped something on the floor, but couldn’t even bend forward enough to recover it without hitting my head on the seat in front of me. Will NEVER fly United again. Gave them a 2 as the flight was on schedule and the attendants did a pretty good job."
Sep 2019,40,Short flight,"We purposely arrived too early at the Buffalo Airport (had to check out of a hotel and vacation completed) so we ate lunch at the airport. Kind of fun - had three gate changes! All of which were near each other so it was not a big deal to move. I suspect the reason was the incoming flight (our plane) was late arriving at the airport. Although the incoming flight was about 30 minutes late arriving in Buffalo, we were boarded in a rather quick manner. Gate checking rolling suitcases also helped boarding process. Time was made up in route and the pilot made up the time. We arrived on time in IAD as scheduled!"
Sep 2019,30,"Full flight, check your carry on","Why do the seats on united aircraft slope downward??  The flight staff is always nice, the seats are always uncomfortable, and the fellow passengers always bring on too much stuff."
Sep 2019,10,Never in my life!!,"First of all we couldn’t have carryon luggage because it was considered Economy. I’ve never experienced that with any other airline. Our seats were ridiculously close together. I’m 5’5” & 120 lbs and could barely fit in the seat. Our entertainment wasn’t working. Each person around me had a fixed movie on their screen; which couldn’t be changed. (Neither could the volume be changed).    Hands down the worst flight I’ve ever experienced and will never fly on United Airlines again, nor would I recommend it. Aside from that, their First class was more like. Regular Business Class, not even a higher end of Business Class.    BEWARE OF BOOKING MULTIPLE AIRLINES FOR GROUP PACKAGES!!"
Sep 2019,40,SQUEEZY POLARIS ON Transcon 787-10,"Did the same aircraft Polaris a week earlier in 1A EWR-LAX Schlepping through terrible EWR with a $120 cab fare from 75th/Broadway Shocking check in self service which didn't work properly at EWR with a full RTW business class ticket and also 1 K status United Club literally miles from the aircraft so this added to making it a schwitzing and schlepigger experience Today's seat 1K next to roilet but this was OK for a day flight Average crew on board who didn't offer a preflight bevvy so had to ask for one Seat is OK and beware of people using your designated overhead marked with your seat number, including crew Tight squeeze getting into and out of seat MY next transcon flight will be American Airlines Transcon First on their superb A321T to from JFK sorry United but an average transcon flight schlepping through EWR just doesn't cut it and you deliberately cut PS transcon from JFK and now want those slots back which you will never get back! YOU PROVE TH BE TRUE CONTINENTAL AKA NEW JERSEY AIRLINES"
Sep 2019,30,Running late,"Getting to the airport, to the ticket counters through TSA and to the gate was easy. What was not easy was the wait to leave. There was some delay somewhere, which caused that chain delay, that we all hate. We left 37 minutes late. The flight arrived at ORD about 31 minutes later than originally scheduled. The personnel were friendly and efficient. The flight itself was smooth with no turbulence. The plane was a Boeing 737-900 (twin-jet) (B739)."
Sep 2019,10,Unhelpful staff,"I understand we ended up in the aftermath of a tropical storm and that United cannot control weather. But they rescheduled us too many times to count, BUT one time the flight they scheduled us on was just completely lost reservation and therefore couldn't get on. AND the next flight they put us on had already been 2 hours delayed but United workers didn't even know those and we would miss our connecting flight. We had to tell her how to do her job. Long story short, we arrived 2 days late, but if it weren't for United would have been just 1."
Sep 2019,10,Worst cabin crew,As a flight attendant I must say the cabin crew were really not pleasant. The cabin was freezing and alot of people asked them to turned the heat up - nothing.  Didn't pay attention to service calls. Just really unpleasant behavior by the crew. Not even one smile.
Sep 2019,20,Messed Up,First of all their on-line booking is terrible. You can’t add a known traveler ID and therefore get pre-check without calling an agent. The latter is an awful experience. Then we paid for premium economy and got stuck in the next to the last row where seats don’t go back and arm rests don’t go up. Awful 2.5 hour flight. Leaving the flight I stopped at customer service counter and showed them my reservation and boarding pass mismatch. Agent claimed it was due to last minute change in aircraft. Right....She refunded money for premium economy but offered no apology. It short just awful.
Sep 2019,20,Uncomfortable,"I am reluctant to give a lot of negative feedback for this flight only because the tickets were so cheap. However, I did have the dreaded ""middle seat"", and because the seating space is limited to the max, the very large person next to me in the window seat kinda oozed partway into my space. I actually give credit to this person because he did try to keep himself relegated to the small space allowed by the airline but after awhile just gave up. This poor rating is not limited to United, a large percentage of airlines have dropped the idea of the traveler's comfort to maximize their earnings."
Sep 2019,50,Bucket List Golf Trip,"Service was excellent, very friendly Attendents. Seating was ok but my choice. Business class would obviously been more confortable. Flight was actually early. Coast to coast flights are not always plesant however this one was special"
Sep 2019,20,Nothing special,"Yet to discover air lines I like (so far only Porter takes the cake...)  It was my first time on United. Longer of two leg flight was on smallest airplane possible, with two and two configuration, and of course I had a pleasure of sitting next to traveler who should get 3 seats by herself...  I do hope that policy will be pass soon that passengers will have to pay for their tickets according to their weight. Think of health care benefits that will provide in long run...  I know I am upsetting about 80% of people right now in North America but trust me it is for your own good and can thank me later.  But back to airlines... what most upsetting that one genius figure out on how to discomfort passengers and others are quick to follow... you have to pay for pretty much everything what was included in the past right now and tickets are still outrageously expensive. What’s next? Paying to use washrooms? I would not be surprised.  The only convenience - and not because of airlines - lately is an app in US and Canada which reduce paper waste where you can fill your entry declaration electronically speeding up border crossing.  So load up the Netflix with some shows or movies, squeeze yourself in a foot of seating, and try to forget where you are and how many hours you have left to the destination as the only (for now) thing you do not have to pay is a two ounces of non alcoholic beverage and smile from overworked and underpaid flight attendant.  I remember time when international air travel was enjoyable experience of a few privileged, not a sophisticated punishment for trying to get to your destination faster...  Try to enjoy your masochistic pleasure called air travel.  AK"
Sep 2019,10,"United has legendary rock bottom service, and today they didn’t disappoint.","I have been flying as a corporate pilot for nearly two years. In order to get to and from work, I airline multiple times per week in uniform. Every other airline, Jet Blue, American, Delta, and all their regional carriers allow crew to loaded early, many times they offer it. Out of habit, I got in the early boarding line. As I scanned my boarding pass, the gate agent looked at me and rudely snapped “you can’t board now! You have to board with zone 4 just like it says on your ticket!” While no airline HAS to allow crew traveling with them to board early, the fact that United Airlines is the only one who doesn’t is one of many great examples of how they are rock bottom when it comes to costumer service. Don’t know how much longer they will last as a company with that kind of service."
Sep 2019,30,Our Annual Trip,"We received a text message less than 12 hours before our flight was scheduled that the flight was cancelled. After an hour and a half on the telephone with their customers service department, we were able to find a later flight only after stating we wanted to speak to a supervisor. The flights were fine, except we had to fly to Chicago and then to Atlanta on the new flight. Flying to BWI as originally planned made more sense. Having to deal with this at 8pm was a huge hassle."
Sep 2019,50,UA always good,"As always United Airlines offered a great way to go from the west coast of America back home to England, seats were comfy and leg room great entertainment had plenty of choices both old and new, service was speedy, food was lots and all good, a pleasure to travel with united Airlines."
Sep 2019,50,Nice Round Trip,"I flew from IAH to MUC and back during the month of September 2019. I enjoyed my brief stay in the Polaris Club at IAH and the new Polaris Business Class seat configuration on the Boeing 767. The entertainment system was excellent and the food and beverage service met my needs. Other than the length of the flight, over which United has little control, this was a pleasant trip."
Sep 2019,30,Twice a year flight,"Standard jammed seats and uncomfortable, standard service, nothing unusual or outstanding. Just the usual."
Sep 2019,40,Excellent Business Class Service,"We were three couples, two flying business class and one in premium economy on a UA 787 August 15, 2019. The service was excellent. Staff were very attentive and caring. Bathrooms were cleaned on a regular basis. Food was very good. Only area to improve is the boarding process at SFO --- a bit disorganized with an emphasized pecking order."
Sep 2019,40,New Premium Economy on 787-10,Final leg of mileage run from NYC to SF. Upgrade didn't clear and luckily assigned myself a Premium Economy seat on 787-10at time of booking which is free for 1Ks and Global Services pax Reasonable seat but not conducive to sleep as recline not much better than economy plus Food was Y food and reminded me of a frozen dinner in terms of taste presentation and texture seats ore in 2-3-2 configuration and I had an aisle seat in 2 Reasonable but if its not free I wouldn't pay for it
Sep 2019,30,OK but not special,Still on mileage run from NYC to SF No upgrade cleared for return flight Short hop from SFO to LAX United Club closed at 6pm do 5 minutes for a quick drink then almost time to board Crew reasonable Exit row seat preassigned at time of booking as United 1K helped a lot but Eco pax don't seem to understand they should keep their limbs within their assigned seat After travelling in Y on UA I can understand why crew may have problems with pax!!
Sep 2019,30,Beware of USA Layover,"The check in and flight from Puerto Vallarta was all fine. We were flying on Air Canada points but they had this segment on a sister airline, United Airlines. The flight to Puerto Vallarta was direct but the return flight had a layover in San Francisco. We allowed for USA screening, as at YVR, but found the measures at PV airprort were quick and simple. HOWEVER, when we landed at San Francisco, we were not allowed to stay in the terminal and just go to our connecting gate. We had to go through a full landing experience involving immigration and customs procedures. Long long lines! We had to retrieve our luggage and have it checked in again for the next leg. We had a 2 hour layover and needed almost all of that time to catch our connecting flight. I do not begrudge the security measures but I expected them at the beginning of the flight not in the middle. Just a warning to beware and ensure you have enough time in a layover."
Sep 2019,10,"If you are traveling with kids, DO NOT fly with United Airlines","DO NOT book with UNITED if you have a carry-on luggage or you are traveling with a child and need to check-in your car seat  United airlines charge you for your CARRY ON  With the basic economy fare, it DOES NOT come with a free carry on, we had to ended up paying more for the standard economy so we can have a carry on    CONS:  1) basic economy fare DOES NOT get you a carry on bag (especially they are not the cheapest flight out there..this does not make sense)  2) with a paid child, they charge you $30 for checking in your car seat (on their website, it shows it's free check-in for car seat if traveling with a child)  3) called in to follow up on a refund for the car seat, called 3 times, each waited about 30 min and had NO RESULTS, they could not find my refund status or record  i still have not received a refund after 20 business days    THIS IS REALLY FRUSTRATING AND A BAD EXPERIENCE  I WILL NOT FLY WITH UNITED AIRLINE AGAIN"
Sep 2019,50,Nice flight,Great flight..on time with good service! Would recommend United versus other domestic carriers I have flown on...
Sep 2019,10,Pretty Much the Worst Service,"United has gone down hill. It has almost hit rock bottom, actually. The service is horrific. As a whole, United is the rudest of any airline I've been on yet. From the moment we tried to get our tickets, the employees are vial and unhelpful. My husband and I went to the ticket kiosk to print out ticket and we were trying to ask the employee why our daughter was not listed. She kept repeating to us that we had to input our confirmation number (which we had already done) and wouldn't hear us out. She told us that kiosk was broken, so that was the only way to do it. When we decided to move kiosks, rather than listen to her insane ranting, she started yelling at us! I told her to get lost and lo and behold, the other kiosk did the trick. This is an instance I would rather deal with A.I. than a real person, and I rarely admit to that.    From there, every employee was rude to every customer they came in contact with. It was disgusting. My husband and I will avoid United like the plague."
Sep 2019,40,"Flight from London to Washington DC, then to Charlotte, NC","The flight was on time,probably 1/2 full. We had asked about getting an upgrade, but was told none available. Once onboard, we were told could upgrade for $250.00 each. As there were many empty seats we were told once airborn we could move laterally which worked out well. The on flight food was good, and was complementry, as was wine or beer if you so chose it. The flight was smooth, and arrived on time with easy connections VIA golf cart transport. Seats were larger, and ore comfortable than other recent airline flights.."
Sep 2019,50,To Italy and Back,"Everything was perfect. The flight connection in Newark and the Atlantic crossing was without incident. The flight crew on both flights were friendly and helpful. In fact, I was surprised. I am used to United employees being somewhat surly."
Sep 2019,30,Seatback Entertainment but Very Cramped,"Was shocked to find seatback entertainment in a short domestic flight--a first. Appreciated being able to play games with other passengers even if my companion was the only one wanting to play backgammon. The seats were comfortable. That's the good. The bad is the closest seat pitch I've encountered in US flights. I'm 6'3"" so I really notice :)    The plane was clean and new. Service was typical. The flight was on schedule."
Sep 2019,10,Don’t fly with this airline!,"Our flight was delayed three times prior to cancelling it. We were told at first it was due to weather, then it was due to the pilot having been on too many hours. They even had us on the plane for an hour and then told us to get off. We were made to stand in line for 6 hours through the night from 2 am u til 8 am trying to get rebooked on another flight. Customer service was horrible, they didn’t bring in extra employees to deal with all the stranded travelers. We were not put up in hotel rooms nor were we given any travel vouchers for meals. We were supposed to be at our destination on Thursday evening and did not arrive until Saturday morning. We were put on standby 5 times and continued to be told there was no room on the flights. Finally they booked us on a flight that got us home on Saturday morning but they lost our luggage and it wasn’t returned to us until Monday. Since they did not give hotel vouchers we did not sleep for 36 hours due to have to stand in line trying to get on other flights. I will never fly with United again, neither should you. No airline should be allowed to treat its customers in this way!"
Sep 2019,40,Good service.,"Good service. Clean, tight, efficient, and relatively friendly. Efficient at takeoff and landing. Food was OK."
Sep 2019,10,Worst Customer service! So disloyal to their customer base!,These guys are crooks. They take advantage of customers! I have flown 14 segments with them this year! I tried to purchase a flight to replace the outgoing segment of a round trip ticket. Even if I bought a BRAND new ticket they wouldn't let me retain the return segment of the round trip ticket! shame on you united! your policies are predatory toward customers!
Sep 2019,40,"Pretty much, what we expected","We were flying from O'Hare International Airport (ORD) in Chicago and Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). We arrived at the United terminal (#1) and went through the kiosks quickly, and we also went through TSA very quickly. The staff at United and even the TSA staff were very efficient. The flight left about six minutes early and arrived about seven minutes early. The plane that we were on was a Boeing 737-800 (twin-jet). The flight itself was very smooth and without any issues."
Sep 2019,30,Poor service made worse by poor information.,"Flew from Phoenix to Chicago on a trip to the U.K. Because United and O’Hare have no real agreement, you end up wandering the terminal to find the waiting area for the bus to the International terminal. Most of the local staff are very rude and unhelpful. In the future, I will try to avoid connecting here."
Sep 2019,40,flight home,"we had seats 11 A & 11 B good seats except I was suppose to get a window seat and got a wall in stead so them must have switched planes on me, so disappointed wanted to see Hawaii on my way out."
Sep 2019,40,Long flight,"this was a long flight 7 hours 20 minutes. we had seats 11A & 11B. good seats lots of leg room and wide seats. snacks and drinks free, food to purchase. very large plane."
Sep 2019,40,Good Flights,"this flight was over 5 hours long. it was a good flight we had seats 11E & 11F, good seats extra wide with lots of leg room. the plane had screens on the back of the seats so time passed pretty quick, drinks and cookies or pretzels were free."
Sep 2019,50,Great flight!,"Our recent United Airlines international flight was wonderful! Leaving from Chicago, O""Hare airport, our connection was smooth, quick, and very pleasant. Boarding, service, and flight were all seamless on this overnight flight. The pilot kept efficient communication with passengers when necessary. The long flight movies and meal were good, and most of all, the flight was smooth and safe!"
Sep 2019,50,Great flights,I had to take three short flights from Denver to Toronto. Amazing staff and service all the way!!!!!
Sep 2019,10,J,"Worst attention ever, the workers for United are the worst in the world, really bad experience, they didn’t even could answer me a question about my flight. I will never take United again in my life"
Sep 2019,20,Big drop in standard this flight,"From the beginning of the flight the on board staff were packing attitude. Very abrupt, not nice in asking questions, commanding, just not courteous. No real smiles at all just that fake one that is so patronising. This was a mixed staff some from New Jersey and some English. It seems to me it was the Jersey crew that were the worst by far. I am American by the way so know bias here. Meals weren't as good either and it hasn't been that long since I flew with them. All and all I was so disappointed and the return was no better."
Sep 2019,20,Amazing Premium Plus cabin but same below standard food on a 14 hour flight,"I am a frequent United flyer but this was my first experience in United Premium Plus (not Economy Plus). Large displays, expanded seating across. This was a pleasant surprise as I had to double pinch myself.    But the same below standard food served here as in Economy Plus and Economy. My comparison is not because I am some gourmet but because of comparison with other Economy services.    If United does not feel that it should care about food, then at least if you are going to have superior seating, at least have the option to upcharge on the food.    And you can't bring 3 meals purchased from the airport on a 14 hour flight (you can bring one meal). The midflight snack was literally a roll with a slice of turkey slammed on it.    If this is the quality of catering (likely worst of any first world airline) both in type and amount of food, then at least give us the option of purchasing something better on-line and then stock it on the aircraft and we will gladly pay the $50 upcharge instead of eating this agan"
Sep 2019,20,Avoid Basic Fare,"I would strongly advise people to avoid flying the Basic Fare if you are flying with family and want to be seated together. My research and experience showed that they split families on purpose probably for the revenue. When we have traveled on Spirit Airlines (whose basic fare United is trying to copy), we were always seated consecutively. We were never separated! My flight back from honolulu was awful. I kept an eye on the United Flight seat availability throughout my vacation. Right before the 24 hr Checking in period started, there were a bunch of seats throughout the plane that can seat three people together. To make sure our group of three could be seated together, I checked into United as soon as the check in opened. However, we were each assigned middle seats on different rows randomly throughout the plane. Even after checking in, the seats next to me and my family members were empty and finally was given to other passengers a few hours later. I couldnt believe that despite having three seats in a row at the start of the check in 24 hr window, United saved the window and aisle seats . I have flown on Spirit and Frontier (basic fare airlines) and they both have tried to seat families even to the point of asking passengers willing to move to keep families together. Sadly, with United I would suggest pay for the seats while buying the tickets but at that point, the base fare gets almost as high as just purchasing normal tickets with free carryon. When trying to board, it felt demeaning to be at the very last set of passengers boarding with the United gate staff being rude and inspecting our personal item very closely. I have never been treated this rudely in Spirit. If flying United with family or friends, just get regular tickets. Basic Fare Passengers are treated like second class citizens. If you are a lone traveler, that can fit everything in one personal item, go for the base fare. United Staff are sticklers to measure baggage. I have never had Spirit Airlines staff measure even some people's extra large bags. Yes Spirit charges extra for things but thats how the whole airline operates. However United trying to copy spirit has not been a good experience for me. The few times I was desperate enough to try to use United Base fare, our family was always separated."
Sep 2019,20,Mistaken Identity: Error of a United Airport Staff,"The staff at the airport was rude and arrogant. A woman pulled me and another family out of line after we had been waiting for more than 45 minutes to get past then initial security check, saying that we had cut under a security rope. None of us had cut under the rope. I'm still not sure what she saw. I wrote the airline to have them review it but have only received automated response back. We were treated horribly and I'll not fly United again. In addition, I own non-profit that often flies victims of human trafficking and will choose to fly them on other airlines until I get an apology from United. I am shocked to be treated this way by United Airlines."
Sep 2019,40,Chicago O’Hare under construction,Chicago O’Hare will require more than 2 hours to pass through customs and security and connect with a domestic flight. Construction of a new train connector has required a bus ride from international terminal to a domestic airline. TSA personnel numbers have also been reduced and diverted to the southern US order as part of homeland security. Security is a longer wait than predicted by earlier schedules. Give yourself 2.5 to 3 hours at Chicago for the flight layover.
Sep 2019,20,First class disaster,"We booked first class seats to/from (SFO) to Omaha, Nebraska. Flew home today (September 23, 2019) and had a terrible experience. We have flown first class on numerous airlines (Alaska, Hawaiian Air, Virgin, etc) .... and have always had great experiences. First off, we had terrible turbulence --- but that we NOT United's fault for sure. With already short nerves (due to the non-stop bumpy ride), we had a trainee stewardess (again, not their fault)... BUT the gal that was mentoring her NEVER STOPPED TALKING!!! We were in row 2 -- and she sat up front talking to the trainee the ENTIRE TIME -- loudly!!! By the time our 3+ hour flight was up, we could become flight attendants ourselves! And - to top that off, the trainee NEVER even came and asked if we wanted drinks or snacks - or even picked up our trash (until right before we landed). When we pay a fortune for first class tickets - we would expect MUCH BETTER service than that! United --- wake up!!! Train your attendants to provide the excellent service that you claim you offer! I'll look for other airlines to travel back and forth in the future!"
Sep 2019,50,flight from Newark to Nassau was very good. Kudos to the Pilot who is flying the plane,Our flight to Nassau was very good. Thanks to the weather and the Pilot who are flying the Plane. They were very good and knows how to fly with no problem. i will fly United again even though they much pricey than other airlines.
Sep 2019,40,Very good service,I have avoided this airline in recent years because of a bad transcontinental experience a few years ago. I chose this flight frankly because of the favorable flight schedule. I did not regret it. Everything was smooth from boarding to arriving and the return. I will flight this route again for sure.
Sep 2019,40,Short comfy hop,"Continuing a Mileage run from NYC to SF for the day arrived from EWR on 787-10 Polaris Reasonable seats with power and WiFi which are much more comfortable than QANTAS Domestic business class Good crew  Pre flight use of reasonable United Club with access as a Lufthansa Senator and also arriving on a transcon PS Polaris flight, but nasty lounge dragon delayed the process"
Sep 2019,50,"Great service, no frills travel experience","Excellent staff, great food and overall a very good experience. Highly recommended for business and vacation travelers."
Sep 2019,50,"Clean Airplane, Friendly Crew",A very comfortable and uneventful flight. The plane was clean and every flight attendant that we cam in contact with was friendly and accommodating. Flight left Munich and arrived on time in Newark.
Sep 2019,50,Road trip,"My trip started with a long flight that lasted 11h30’ but because I was flying with United Airlines it was a great experience. Good food, very professional personnel and plenty of audio/video contents for the whole flight. Fly with United Airlines! 😉👍🏻"
Sep 2019,50,Frankfurt to Dulles-Best B/c of Miroslav,"United is already a class show, and particularly business class. However, they took it up a notch with the outstanding service of Miroslav. He was every bit as professional and focused as most United flight attendants. Still, he found a way to take great service even farther. He was amicable and humorous. He paid close attention to how he could make the flight better. He went out of his way to offer ice cream, drinks, and food. He had a number of guest to attend to, but he interacted with each of them and did so without seeming rushed.    The food on the United flight was great and the business class seating was fantastic...a real joy to fly for nine hours straight. Well done."
Sep 2019,40,Easy flight,"I like an easy flight. Had it going to and from. The flight going out was delayed some because the electrical outlets under the seats weren't working. It was going to take a long time to fix so they decided to fly out without the outlets working. Good decision for me as I carry a wireless charger. We left on time coming back. Some turbulence which of course is out of the pilots control. We do upgrade to economy plus so there is a bit of wiggle room, tho not much."
Sep 2019,10,"Cancelled flight due to ""mechanical issues"" and still no rental car refund","I recently booked a flight from Chicago to Springfield IL, and it was cancelled 2 hours before our departure time due to ""mechanical issues"". It was very late at night and I had to get back home by the morning, so I had to rent a car and drive 3:30 hours. I got home at roughly 2 am (the flight was supposed to land at 10 pm) and had to pay $350 for the rental car. United has told me that they will only reimburse the cost of the flight (roughly $100) and will not cover the cost of the rental car, so now I am out $250 on a flight that was cancelled because of mechanical problems. I will never fly United again, and would not recommend it to anyone else."
Sep 2019,40,Excellent Seat,"This Premium Economy Seat was an excellent seat. The seat had plenty of width and legroom. The addition of leg rest was a plus. The only thing that was bothersome was the location of the headphone jack, which was to the rear of my right armrest. The selection of music, movies and TV shows was excellent as well. Glad I upgraded on this flight, although I did not mind having my the row to my self in Economy on the way to Japan."
Sep 2019,50,Direct Flight to Tahiti from San Francisco,"We took United new direct flight from San Francisco to Papeete and it was great. Very convenient without having to fly to LAX to change planes, great leg room and over head space."
Sep 2019,40,MIles Trip to Munich and Back - Watch Pre-Clear Security,"My main point is to get your boarding pass reprinted by UNITED before going through US security. I tried to use my boarding pass printed by LH in Munich when going through Newark security. A TSA agent looked at my boarding pass and told me to go through the Pre-Check line. When I finally got to the checkpoint, I was told the scanner could not read the ticket as Pre-Check. The same thing happened to another passenger. Standing AGAIN in another line was just too much. Without throwing a tantrum (which would not have helped), the agent took pity and had us taken to the head of the normal security check. Otherwise, the United flights (booked with miles) were just fine. I flew LOT to Warsaw on a new Boeing - super equipment. The Warsaw airport was terrific. Austrian Airlines was fine. Vienna's passport control was overwhelmed and with less than an hour between (on time) arrival and departure was VERY stressful. I DID make the connecting flight to Newark but ran to do it."
Sep 2019,50,Customer Service is top notch,I am very impressed with United Airlines. We were taking a connecting flight from MKE to O'Hare and then on to Calgary. O'hare stopped incoming planes due to fog and we missed our connecting flight. United Airlines proceeded to book us on a later flight and we opted to take the bus to O'hare to play it safe. When we told the United employees of our plan they gave us free bus tickets and food vouchers for the inconvenience (we didn't even need to ask and we definitely didn't even think to!). We also had an issue of being charged twice for our baggage because of the changes in our reservation and the refund department assisted perfectly in getting our money back. We had a similar experience last year with a different airline where the flight was canceled because a flight attendant didn't show up for the job and they fought us every step of the way on this stuff. I am very impressed with how United handled these issues. Thank you!!
Sep 2019,10,Sorriest Airline Since Eastern,"I wish I could give a minus one rating. I cannot even begin to describe the number of delays, flight changes, crew members missing in action, mechanical issues and just plain crappy attitude of every UA employee I have dealt with today. And PS, the flight attendants are no longer allowed to help old ladies lift their carry on bags into the overhead bins, and they are very snarky about it if you dare ask. NEVER flying with this worthless airline again. The last time I had such consistently poor service was from Eastern Airlines...right before they went bankrupt. Sayonara United."
Sep 2019,40,Easy flight back home,This was a quick trip to help my daughter move back into her dorm. We actually drove down and I flew back.    I fly United Airlines quite often. The flight was on time and we boarded promptly. I actually wound up in a row by myself which was wonderful after the lady in the aisle seat did something to her seatbelt. The pilot actually got us into Newark ahead of schedule which was definitely a plus.
Sep 2019,30,nashville trip,"seats are tight, little choice of snack and drinks, wait time at terminals was ok but could have had more kiosks open at the busy time"
Sep 2019,10,"Drap, cramped and overpriced","The planes are drab and dark and very uncomfortable. I am handicapped and did not go to the bathroom the whole time otherwise I would have had to struggle to almost the end of the plane. My elderly husband was not allowed to use first class and he had to go to the end of the plane. The whole atmosphere, the lighting, everything about the plane was drab, colorless and you are just squeezed into whatever space they have avilable, even cows to market have more room and better food (which you have to pay a premium for). Domestic flights leave much to be desired. No young stewardress any longer it is no longer a profession to aspire to. Even the workers are subjected to these inhumane conditions. Our government should be ashamed to allow our airlines to operate like this just for their profits and not caring about the comfort or concern of their paying passengers who are paying a premium to sit in 17"" seats across, small toilets and crappy food (which you pay for at a premium). Disgusting. I cannot write anymore just the word disgusting says it all."
Sep 2019,10,Worst travel ever,The airline just will leave you stranded. We were almost. Late to Seattle to leave out on a. Cruise. To Alaska. The airline. Didn’t even care about us. They sent our plane to London. Just left us. Hanging for 5 hours. If the cruise line hadn’t waited we would have be left
Sep 2019,40,Traveling to Tahiti,"Since this was a bucketlist trip for my wife and myself, we splurged on business class tickets to Tahiti. We were trying to buy business class for only part of the way, but found it cheaper to buy the ticket roundtrip. This was off but we could not imagine doing this flight, 22 hours with layover, in economy the entire way. The United Polaris product was the old product in the 2-2 layout to California and the 2-2-2 layout to Tahiti. The planes are a bit tired, but quite comfortable. Meal service was quite good EXCEPT from Tahiti the meal was inedible. The tenderloin was tougher than my shoe sole. The Polaris lounges were comfortable and convenient with showers, made to order meals, and a high end bar. If i was asked again, I wouldn't have changed a thing"
Sep 2019,10,Do not book with United,"I had a flight from Cleveland, Ohio to Manila,Philippines. My first leg of the flight was to Denver where United did a “scheduled maintenance “ on the plane that I was supposed to have for my second leg. They did not have another plane to replace it so had a three hour layover before we got a plane to replace it. By this happening it cause us to miss our connecting flight in Tokyo. Due to this, instead of an hour layover we were forced to sit at the airport for 6 hours and then they sent us to Guam instead of Manila. We were forced to sit in Guam for another 5 hours before they got us a flight to Manila. When we went to check in at Guam we were told United did not have a ticket for our flight to Manila and had to try and get this fixed which almost made us miss the flight. By this all happening I lost money on a hotel that I booked for the night I was supposed to arrive and also missed a flight I had booked for the next morning. When I tried checking in to come home I had the same problem with United not updating the ticket info and had a lot of problems being able to check in which almost made me miss my flight. When I told United customer service about this and told them I wanted compensation for what money they caused me to lose they said they don’t do that because they are not responsible for prebooked accommodations or other flights even if it is their fault and offered me only a $200 voucher to fly with them again. Why would I fly with them again and have the same problem. I have always flown with Delta and never had any problems but I was not able to get a flight with Delta on the day I was leaving so I went with United and I realized that was a mistake. DO NOT USE UNITED AIRLINES OR YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!"
Sep 2019,50,Hands down the beat service I have ever had with an airline.,Today was going to be a super stressful/long day. Came to the airport with my friend since our hotel was an hour away and we had a rental car under her name And she had an early flight so I planned to stay in the airport for 9 hours until my flight. I figured I’d work and watch Netflix to pass the time- but I thought I’d ask if there was any option for me to fly earlier. Theresa in Rapid City was able to arrange things for me to get home 6 hours earlier than expected AND I don’t have to sit in the airport for 9 hours. I am so grateful and will always choose United over any other airline.
Sep 2019,10,Customer Interactions,"I have never seen a more despicable attitude of an airline towards their customers. From the first point of contact during check-in, to the service on the aircraft, to the cold food they serve, and the attitude of the airplane staff, it is simply atrocious. I have no patience to write down details of their despicable service and very poor attitude towards their customers.  Suffice to say that, this is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Just to qualify my experiences, I have travelled in the following Airlines on international routes, where even Economy Class passengers are treated with respect. The Airlines are : Air India, Lufthansa, SwissAir, Malaysian, Singapore, Cathay Pacific, British Airways, Quantas etc who treat even Economy Class passengers with respect.  I wish to recommend that everyone avoids flying by this Airline (United Airlines) ever. It’s THE WORST I have seen so far. All other Airlines by which I have travelled, are far far better in service and customer care.  The top management of this Airline needs to be replaced, to say the least."
Sep 2019,10,vary average/pc extraordinaire,"I've been flying Asian airlines for 25+ years.  This time I virtually had to fly American, and as expected disappointed. I understand today's pc employment environment and have to deal with this nonsense daily. I just dislike old (72 yo), casual orientated and overweight flight attendants. Not even to mention the long hair by some of your staff Just unreal how your company seems to be comfortable working at such low ratio. I am from within the travel industry and do understand a potential reply to please your audience. Please side track the pc employment nonsense and start to deliver quality"
Sep 2019,30,Reasonable,flight from Glasgow to NYC was on time we were on our way to Las Vegas and not relishing our 5 hr flight to Vegas but had no choice but again United flight left on time on our journey back flight left Vegas at 6am we originally booked and paid an extra £100 for later flight at 9am only to find United canceled that flight we were out £100 with no compensation this happened to us twice so be careful.plane a bit cramped food could be better normally buy sandwiches at Glasgow.
Sep 2019,10,stay away if you want to have a safe trip,"Do not book United Airlines for the following reasons:  1-If you want to travel on time, United is not the choice because they do not follow the flight time at all. My flight was supposed to be at 11:40 pm, they changed it without telling me or notifying me to 12:40! An hour late and I have a connection at DC which we lost.  2-If you want to be in a comfortable airline, United is not the choice because their airplanes are not comfortable at all.  3-If you think you can go and complain, United does not have customer service. I went to the airport customer service to check why they did not tell me about the flight time change, they said call the 1-800 number. I called that number, one answered me with no idea how to fix the issue and when I asked for the supervisor, she became so mad and started yelling at me and hanged up on me! Yes, this is exactly what she did.  4-If you want your bag to arrive with you on your flight on time, United is not the choice. They missed luggage a lot and they do not send it right away. You will have to wait hours and hour to receive your bag. That is what happened to me too! I arried at 9: am and my bag was delayed and they told me that they would send it to me as soon as it arries. That was a lie! my bag arried at 1:30 pm at the airport and they kept telling me that they will send it in the next hour and it did not arrieve until late midnight that day. I literally wasted the entire day calling India where the baggage service location is and they did not do anything.  5-I wish I could describe the most terrible experience that I had with united. I sent them email and the auto responce says they will come back to me after 21busness days! Imagine if you have a problem, you would have to wait for that long just to see if they answer your email correctly.  6-I will never take United!"
Sep 2019,10,Poor services,"Oh my what an experience I had with Un nited... First all my flight was delayed in Aruba due to maintenance issues with the auxiliarator. Ok,I can appreciate that. They managed to deplane us for about 45 minutes and we were back boarding the plane. I had a connecting flight that needed to be rebooked, which rep did do. However, once we landed in Newark for me to catch my connecting flight, (scheduled to depart at 9:45 pm), I was told it was getting ready to leave so I would need to run to the gate to see if I can catch them. Ugh...how about you get on the phone and call the gate agent and tell them you have people connecting and need to get on that plane. (last one for the night).... I run to the gate only to find out that the plane had already took off (20 minutes prior to its scheduled time). Ok, whose communicating with whom??? Obviously no one.... Re-booking agent was very sweet and helpful. She rebooked us for the next day and set us up with over night stay in hotel. Fast forward, get on shuttle to hotel only to find out United over booked guests at that particular hotel and they would have to book us somewhere else.  Really United.... can you get your stuff together treat your customers like you really care. I will not be flying United again, I have a choice, and I will choose an airline that respects its customers and will treat them with a little compassion and understanding."
Sep 2019,10,Missed two flights not due to weather,We missed 2 flights not due to weather. Due to plane being too heavy. It was overfilled with gas and we had to run out gas for an hour. Made us miss first flight. Second flight missed due to docks being too high. Couldn’t find one that fit dock says pilot. We missed work. At the point of tears our experience has been so horrible. Front desk agent asks “Are you going to board or what?” When we try to ask for help. Flight attendants say tell me you want ice when I come by first thing or you aren’t getting ice. Didn’t get comped room or taxi because they say it was due to weather. We were on the plane though and told it was due to gas and docks. We feel so hopeless and United truly does not care.
Sep 2019,40,"Long flight journey from Shanghai to Orlando,Florida, USA",comfortable flight with good flight condition. The stewardess are mature . They are helpful . Muslim food was served for us as requested during our booking .
Sep 2019,30,Weather Conditions were not good the day . .,"After reaching Houston at 7:47 pm , our flight to SanDiego was to leave at 9:49pm  but because there plane did not leave Orlando on time (stormy weather there) it did not arrive until 11pm and we did not leave till 12:45 am.  Because of this I could not pick up my rental car from Payless because they were closing at midnite , but when I did call them they assured me that those car rental co.s that were in San Diego would give me the same deal , which they would not do.  Going home ,on the 20th , was another story. We boarded and waited long enough for them to tell us that the windshield was cracked and had to change planes . Out then in and on our way again."
Sep 2019,20,So Inept,"United Airlines continues to go downhill in terms of customer service. Upon our arrival at Harrisburg Intl Airport, the UAL agent indicated she couldn't find our reservation, despite the fact I provided her with an e-ticket number, airlines confirmation number, and pre-check confirmation. Finally, she located our record. Once on board, there were people sitting in our seats (double booked). We were able to find other seats onboard. We flew from Harrisburg into Dulles. Upon our arrival there, our flight number was no where to be found on the flight board. The customer service agent pretty much accused me of not knowing what I was talking about, despite the fact I had the ticketing agent on the telephone confirming our flight status. She was rude and abrupt with my husband and myself. Finally, a supervisor was close by and took charge of the situation and after about 30 minutes of aggravation, reassigned us to another flight to Krakow. I refuse to ever fly United again, even though I am a former employee. Their standards have sunk to new lows."
Sep 2019,40,Love the Premium Economy service,"My wife decided to upgrade us to Premium Economy and, I have to say, it was worth it. Aside from the extra legroom. we also had very good meals, with real silver and napkins!! We also had dedicated overhead space for our carryon, though, it appeared someone grabbed one of our spaces on the return flight. Service was very good and, I have to say, better than some of our previous United experiences. Entertainment options were plentiful. Considering the length of the flight (10+ hours), it is well worth the upgrade from Economy."
Sep 2019,30,Thank goodness for scarf lumbar supports,"The seats on our flight from Pittsburgh to San Francisco were very uncomfortable, it felt like the headrest was farther forward than the lower seatback. I only survived because I was able to use my scarf as a lumbar support. The second flight we took to Seattle had much better seats. The service at the check-in counter was extremely poor, with the employees instructing passengers NOT to form lines, creating a free-for-all for the next available kiosk, and the employees were more interested in chatting with the customers they knew rather than helping people waiting to check bags to keep the lines moving."
Sep 2019,40,Making the vacation last longer,"Leaving Dublin City Airport should not be this hard. However, there were long lines at the security points, long lines at the 2d security point, (for US-bound flights) and horrendously long lines at the Customs point. Note, the suggested arrival time for overseas flights is 3 hours prior. That doesn't mean 3 hours for everyone but you. Our flight was delayed because more than a handful of passengers did not follow these guidelines. Or even sitting in their assigned seats. The crew had to move four people to the proper seats because they thought the 'empty"" seats were free to sit in. Our departure was further delayed because our spot in the take-off line was pushed back because we werent ready to go. All in all, not the airlines fault at all, but we still left over half an hour late, which cause about the same amount of time being late on arrival. One bright spot, though was that upon landing, the crew suggested that people who didn't have connecting flights should just hang back and let the connecting folks deplane first. This was done and it did go smoothly. There is a little common sense and courtesy left in the world."
Sep 2019,50,Love our flight attendants,"My husband and I are celebrating our 21st anniversary and our flight attendants made our flight more memorable. They gave us a shout out at the end of the flight for our anniversary. Jennifer Upthegrove, was delightful wonderful sweet and attentive. She makes us want to spend more money to get first class every time."
Sep 2019,40,Out bound excelent return antother story,The outbound was a good flight no problem whatsoever. On the return the palne was changed and so were they seats. Being a Premium I never expected to wind up in the back of the plane. As a Gold Frequent Flier I could no undersatnd why many of us were bumped back to Economy. I had back surgey recently and picked my seats some two months prior so yes I was very disappointed and upset since no one at the airline would tell me why so many were bump back. It was because the Airline changed equipment and no one knew but that still does not aswer why Frequent fliers were moved without an expalnation at least. Over all This really is the only airline that I fly since the problem are not very frequent.
Sep 2019,40,Comfortable flight,"First class food is adequate calorie - wise but not all that tasty. Plane was a comfortable 737. On time service, pleasant stewards."
Sep 2019,40,O'Hare to London,"Saved our pennies and got business class tickets. Enjoyed the Polaris Lounge in O'Hare quite a bit: great service and multiple perks. Food, drinks and snacks were good, and service by the attendants was quite good.  The ""pods"" on the plane were nice and reclined fully to a flat position, but there was a very small space for your feet, so it was still difficult to get a comfortable sleeping position."
Sep 2019,40,On time friendly staff,It was on time friendly staff and I was able to get my boarding pass on line for a overseas flight.  I specially like that I was able to get assigned seat as soon as I reserved and they Ofer free check in luggage
Sep 2019,10,Really really bad trip,"Flight 5158 from Prescott on Wed 918/19: 13 HOUR DELAY! One engine would not start, fine. I don't want to go with a bad engine. United's solution was to DRIVE the mechanics up from Phoenix after they waited for the part to come from TUCSON. That took us to about 3 pm. Nope, could not be fixed. Next solution: have another aircraft fly and take us to Denver. That took us to an 8 pm take off. 13 HOUR DELAY. The entire passenger group went through security three times that day. Now, why not bring the aircraft immediately? Why not have a spare plane within 2 hours of Prescott? Why? Yes, they gave us each $150 credit. But, that cannot get back the entire day I had planned with my daughter in Denver. That time can never be replaced. So, finally, I am in Denver by 10:30 on the 18th. My daughter who has to work in the morning has to pick me up at 11:15, and drive me 30 minutes to her house. Yawn.    My return flight is Flight 5159 on 9/21/19. in Denver at 5:30 pm, the plane is listed as on time. Whew! I have theater tickets that night in Prescott. Thankfully, I would get there on time. NOPE. We were on the plane, ready to take off, and the cargo hold would not close. United acted a lot faster in Denver than they did in Prescott, there was only one and a half-hour delay. But, I did miss the play.    So, my take on this is that I am losing confidence in the aircraft being flown in and out of Prescott. I really really did not expect to survive that return flight. Two flights, two broken airplanes. Not very reassuring.    I have taken these flights in and out of Prescott before, many times. Both to Denver, and to LAX. I am losing confidence in the safety of the aircraft and I will NEVER expect to arrive anywhere on time when flying from Prescott again. Ever. Really. This is starting to feel like I am flying Allegiant or something."
Sep 2019,50,denver bound,"I upgrades to Buisness First going from Newark to Denver and had one of the most enjoyable Flights that I have ever had. The Flight attendants were attentive and cheerful even though the flight left at 5Am. The seats were fully reclinable and very comfortable and the brekfast serves was a kale and goat cheese quiche with tomato and, yogurt and fresh fruit. The one thing that was not good was that at 4Am they did not have Piority Check IN which is supoposed to be one of the perks for buisness class."
Sep 2019,10,Mr,"Two awful travel experiences on United in 3 days.    First on Friday afternoon, traveling LGA-IAD. We were told that the Flight was delayed because incoming flight held up due to “extreme weather at Dulles.” Except I had multiple other families arriving at Dulles at that moment who (in real time) reported that they both got in early and that there blue skies as far as the eyes could see. And no other flights out of LGA to DC area had significant delays. Info and communication so poor and flight continually pushed in approx 30 min increments causing me to cancel and rebook on another airline which got me to DC before original United flight eventually departed. Missed most of rehearsal dinner due to United’s poor service and communication.    2 days later on United shuttle from IAD to PVD. We get onto the runway only to discover a mechanical issue....eventually causing us to return to gate and start (again) the incremental delays. Departure of 10:15a turned to apology of “we meant to say update at 10:15a). Unfortunately, no other flights to providence from this airport so couldn’t rebook on another airline. Got up early to get to airport for 825a departure to get to Sunday work event outside of Providence only to be delayed 3.25 hrs for a 1 hr flight. Was embarrassingly late for an important work event.    Not sure of the odds of having two 3+ delays on 2 short flights in one weekend where weather was not a factor.    United express was just awful."
Sep 2019,10,United Airlines doesn't respect the European directive for cancellation,"I bought a flight from Paris to New York with United Airlines and I just discover my flight has been cancelled at the airport, I didn't receive a notification before. The company's employee told me to ask for a financial compensation as the European directive n° 261/2004 said because the cancellation was due to a technical problem with the plane (it was supposed to be the last travel for the plane and it appears an hydraulic failure). When I asked to the company for it, they replied that they will not give me a financial compensation because it was due to the weather. I checked with some companies specialized for these kind of cases (and it was also the only one plane cancelled this day on the screen...)and it appears that the weather was great enough to fly. I just want to warn you that the company try to find arguments to don't respect the law and the passenger rights when it is time to pay. For sure, I won't be travelling with them and I won't promote them until they will not be able to respect the passenger rights."
Sep 2019,40,Newark to Rome,Comfortable 8 hour flight. Very good service. We sat in middle so the ride was smooth. I would bring a snack or sandwich with me next time
Sep 2019,10,Cheap in every possible way,Poor service. Did not receive extra leg room seats and airline refused refund. Terrible cheap airline.
Sep 2019,10,United Airlines - Ancient fleet coupled below average service!,"Taking a transatlantic flight you expect a certain level of comfort, cleanliness and service. The Boeing 767-400 was ancient with a poor cabin layout, seating and an entertainment system screen which was tipped sideways.    First interaction with the crew (after I had upgraded to “premium” economy was - “you can’t use the bathroom.    I found rubbish on my seat underneath the pillow and blanket.    Generally treated poorly by the flight attendants, like they’re doing you a favor.    Won’t be in a rush to fly UA again, even if I can’t fly business or premium economy and I miss out on the air miles. Swiss / Lufthansa are a class above."
Sep 2019,10,Diverted flight debacle,"My husband and I were flying from Chicago to Omaha, NE. There were storms in the Omaha area so we were diverted to Kansas City (KCI). When we landed at KCI, they kept us on the plane while they refueled and figured out what to do with next. Keep in mind, Kansas City is south of Omaha. So...they decide to route us west toward Wichita to circle around the storms and come into Omaha from the West. So, they load enough fuel on the plane for a 1 1/2 hour flight and we taxi out like we're going to take off but we don't take off. We sat there for close to an hour. Turns out that they kept rerouting us several different ways including a more direct route to the north. But we couldn't do that because there was too much fuel on plane. It took so long for them to decide on a route the flight crew timed out. They tacied back to the gate and we got off the plane. By this time it was close to midnight. That said they would put us up in a hotel and fly us to Omaha the next day. So we waited and waited but they couldn't find hotel rooms. The flight was rescheduled for 11 AM. If we could find a hotel on our own, they would reimburse us but we had get to the hotel and back and we wouldn't be reimbursed for that. Our only other option was to spend the night in the airport with no place to sleep. We asked about renting a car and driving to Omaha (3 hour drive) but they wouldn't reimburse for that. They did offer each of us a $10 food voucher so we could eat breakfast in the morning a $75 voucher for future travel with United. So, we spent night in the airport and needless to say we will most likely never use the $75 future travel voucher because we won't be flying United ever again!"
Sep 2019,50,Impressive,"I flown from Germany to sfo a month ago on Lufthansa and it was horrible. Decided to make a change and try United. It was perfect. They’re quick to get your drinks and food to you, the seats don’t hurt your lower back, perfect leg room, wonderful TVs, clean bathrooms and the flight attendants are quick to respond if you need anything. Also, if your sleeping, they put the food and snacks on your table even if your not awake. Highly recommend 🥰"
Sep 2019,40,Pick up Corvette,The flight was good. Ontime and smooth going. Switching flights in Denver was a monster. It took me 30 minutes to get from one gate to the other nonstop. Denver is the worst airport that I have ever been to. I have been around the world several times and Denver takes the award worlds worst.
Sep 2019,10,Absolutely the Worst Ever!!!,Airline had an 1 1/2 delay numerous connections in Washington  Said out by 550 pm  Boarded on plane another 45 minutes  Ms Perez customer service agent was awesome in moving my seat up to deplane sooner !!  Wendy was more interested in 1 certain group of people with a connecting flight in Washington she made no effort to assist any others with connecting flights  Once on board flight attendants made no effort to move things along !!!    First time flying United will absolutely be my last  I’d fly American before flying United again !!!!!!!!!!  Flying out at 6:50 my scheduled flight was 3:40  I hate United !!!!!!  Stewardess still only working with select few on flight status guess we don’t exsist
Sep 2019,30,Second time getting out of Ohio was messed up,"I’ve been flying to Ohio for business a few times recently, the past two trips were messed up on the return.  This trip, I’m flying Columbus to Phoenix on United. I’m booked on a route connecting through Chicago on an Aug Friday afternoon. I arrive at the airport at like 10:00 am, hoping to find a route home earlier. Nothing cooking today as all routes earlier than mine were booked full. Ok, so I wait for my 2:00 flight to ORD.  Got on the flight, heard the chatter about delays, no worries as I had a planned long layover in Chicago just in case. More delays announced, still ok. Then at the third announcement of delays I figure it’s time for me to start working contingency plans.  I’m on the phone with UA working through alternatives. What had been open a few min prior were now all booked. I’m screwed. Then another announcement that the flight was delayed several hours made my primary connection unworkable. It also explained why just a few min ago alternatives disappeared, UA was busy rebooking passengers stuck on my flight and wanted to get their higher value customers covered before telling the rest of us. I get it.  So, I’m stuck for the night unless I can get UA to move me over to Delta are AA. No dice.  Now my choices are to stand in the mile long line, or just rebook myself on the phone.  Next morning, I’m on the 7:00 am flight to Denver with a connection home.  It all worked out, I’m just a bit upset at UA for gaming their delay announcement basically locks out lesser priority customers.  The eventual flight... was one of the older continental airplanes. They are the ones with satellite TV. A bit dated. I was served some sort of egg dish for breakfast. I should have chosen the cereal. The good news is I did eventually get home. All my efforts to get home early or on time failed. That’s air travel. It’s just a bit frustrating to be told in clear terms, “not important” when things go bad. No one wants to feel less valuable when it comes to flying home. I wish UA had better ways of handling these situations.  Nice things about UA...  so nice to be offered food or snacks again.  I love the WiFi delivered entertainment  Newer aircraft are nice  I can tell the crew is happier... they tend to treat passengers better when they are happy."
Sep 2019,10,WORST FLIGHT EVER,"Flight# UA345 or any united airlines flight are USELESS AND PATHETIC. We had a flight at 7.50AM on Sept 21,2019 from Washington to Honolulu. Flight was delayed for 12 hours and we were asked to leave the plane 3 times with the reasons after maintenance that there is a problem with fuel, AC or engine. These reasons should be resolved before boarding the passengers. If we call airlines, they advise to call Expedia and Expedia advise to call insurance company (AIG) and then all the back and forth calling and frustration. I would never ever recommend such a useless and unplanned airlines to anyone. Worst experience ever !!!!!"
Sep 2019,40,Flight to Chile,"We had a short lay over in Houston (70 Min). The flight left Huntsville 60 min late. But with help we made the flight to Santiago, The flight attendents from Houston to Santiago were great and we arrived almost an hour early. All in all a good trip here. Hopeing for a good return flight."
Sep 2019,20,Great Polaris Seat/Awful Service,"One of our absolute worst flight in First Class/Polaris class ever. The seats and amenities are terrific for a transatlantic flight however the service was curt, cold and we felt ignored by the crew. The purser on this August 29th departure set the tone for this flight and her attitude was get them on and then get them off the plane. When you are paying $3500 per ticket you expect a bit more, lemon for your drink. No way...'we just have limes, so here'. Keep in mind we slept over 5 hours on this 7.5 hour journey so I feel bad for my cabin mates who had to deal with this crew's ignorance and ineptitude for far longer than we did. We woke about about 1.5 hours from landing and breakfast was already served and we were not offered neither breakfast nor coffee until we flagged a coach flight attendant who was making her way back to the plane. This crew should be retrained on their service skills and demeanor!"
Sep 2019,40,Very Pleasurable,"I took United Airlines for a business trip earlier this month. The Airline staff really made the whole flight and boarding very pleasurable. They were very nice, courteous, and professional. I'd definitely take this airline again."
Sep 2019,50,Flight Experience Has Improved,"I usually don’t fly United but they had more flights to my ultimate destination so it was decided to try them again. Their loading the plane was smooth and fast and we departed on time every leg of my trip. Surprisingly their overhead bins were larger then I expected and storage was not an issue for me. The first class meal was fresh, healthy, and surprisingly tasty. The flight attendants were friendly, efficient, and helpful. I would happily fly with United again and I wonder what I have been missing out on by not going with them sooner. I did not try the in flight entertainment but it is a streamed WiFi using an app. If used do do your download before you are in the air."
Sep 2019,50,My only U.S. airline,"My husband and I are avid travelers and we book United whenever we can. I think their pilots are so wonderful. Always keeping us informed of issues, if any. No airline is perfect but this airline is our favorite. Upgraded my return from Rome to Chicago and on to IAH. Business/First was so special. Thank you, United Airlines. We have lived around the world for 30 years for work and we always felt like we were home when we boarded your aircraft from remote destinations!"
Sep 2019,50,Could not have been better,"UA446 mco to ewr this Friday was perfect. Departed on time, good legroom and landed 20 minutes early. What more could you ask for."
Sep 2019,10,Dreaded that United was our only choice,"We try to avoid United Airlines since they are the most delay-plagued and logistics-challenged airline I've ever experienced. Unfortunately, on a recent trip to Chicago, they were our only option. Our outgoing flight was delayed 90 minutes. I expected this as I'd be surprised if a United Flight were EVER on time.    For the flight home, however, they did the old ""delayed by one hour..."" dance which is why I stopped flying them in the first place. Every hour, they send you a text telling you your flight is delayed another hour. They won't even let you change flights. So, our 2 PM flight got delayed until 5:30 and we figured ""fine, if it's going to be three hours we'll use our complementary lounge passes"" which someone had given us. Of course, we were told ""we don't accept single passes at THIS lounge."" I should have expected that.    Also, we upgraded to First Class and I initially wondered why it was so inexpensive to do so and then saw their First Class is nothing to write home about. The seats are about the same as you would get in COACH on an old 747. The service wasn't that great, either. We got a meal, but no one came around for the last three hours of the flight to even ask if we wanted beverages or needed anything. Terrible!    Please, Alaska, if you see this, add some more routes to/through Chicago!!!!"
Sep 2019,40,Return Flight,We recently flew from Newark to Tampa and back via United Airlines. The flight to Tampa was uneventful with no surprises or delays. The return flight had a mechanical problem (air conditioning) but was fixed just prior to our scheduled boarding time with minimal delay to cool off the cabin since the plane had been sitting at the gate all night and morning. There was also an electronic issue and the monitors weren’t working. During the flight someone used hair spray in the lavatory causing the alarm system to go off which caused some concern as to what was happening. Once the alarm was silenced things calmed down and we arrived safely at EWR and our luggage made it too.
Sep 2019,10,Worst costumer service and policies ever,"I wouldn't recommend to anyone  Flight landed with 5 hours delay and i ve got to my final destination 1 day later. I have so missed the chance to tell my dad goodbye. I had to pay for hotel ,food and transportation out of pocket and they did not offer any refund but they hope my next flight will be a much better experience, but guess what there will not be a next time"
Sep 2019,10,Worst United Experience we’ve ever had.,"We almost always fly United when we travel international. Until now. We’re not business class, just a regular couple who save for vacations and after paying the already exorbitant base cost of a ticket, can’t afford any fancy upgrade. Terrifically unhappy to discover their new policy of charging for seat selection. I have terrible anxiety and want to sit by my husband on a long flight. I didn’t know about this policy until the last minute- when I went to select a seat, there were literally only two left together in the very back and I STILL had to pay. Our flight out of Naples was a disaster. Boarding was chaotic disorganized and caused the flight to be late. Every 20 minutes or so, during a 10 HOUR flight the PA and televisions dinged loudly and yelled, “ please fasten your seatbelts”. This was INSANE and disrupted any possibility of sleep and interrupted everyone’s entertainment. The flight attendants were friendly but only gave us 3 opportunities to get water and it was a long flight. In Newark we were stopped from entering the terminal by a United employee who told us Carry-On was not allowed and we had to check our bags. We said it was an international flight but she insisted. We walked all the way back out and almost paid an extra $160 in baggage fees but thankfully we found an extremely helpful woman who knew what she was doing. The flight from Newark to Denver said it was on time but it boarded late and then sat on the runway for at least 30 minutes for reasons unknown. This caused the flight to be late and for folks to miss their connecting flight. Once landed, the crew then asked anyone trying to catch another flight to get up first and get off the plane while the rest of us remained seated. This just about caused a stampede I got trampled over by some guy and for what? To save a couple of minutes, maybe, instead of an orderly disembarking.  Prior to this trip I searched for a domestic flight on a different trip and discovered Carry-On is no longer allowed. Which is a dirty little trick, much like seat selection, to get more money. Found a cheaper ticket with better fares, no ridiculous surprise fees.  As a lowly Economy traveler, if I am to be treated as a cattle anyways, I’ll do it on another airline from now on."
Sep 2019,40,"On Time, But Not A Comfortable Aircraft","While United did a good job of getting us to Vancouver in terms of leaving and arriving on time, our Embraer ERJ-175 had to be one of the most uncomfortable planes I've been on in a long time. Thankfully we are not large people as I can only imagine the discomfort from being confined in those hard seats for any amount of time. When we first booked the flight, we were scheduled to be on a A320. Many schedule modifications later, we ended up on the ERJ."
Sep 2019,20,Late as Usual,"Aside from the plane being delayed an hour due to weather from the US, United employees added to the delay. The flight was scheduled for a departure of 1210. The plane landed around 1045 and gate made an announcement that boarding would begin in 30-40 mins. Around 1115, the flight crew was just arriving to the gate. They then had to wait an additional 10-15 mins to catch the bus out to the tarmac where the plane was parked. Why is the crew showing up that late? You had an extra hour to relax. You should have been there early. By 12pm they began checking boarding passes and boarding the buses. Mind you that's 10 minutes before we're supposed to leave. Needles to say, it's now 1230 and we're only at about 50% boarded. Yet again, United proving how far they have and continue to fall in airline service."
Sep 2019,40,787-10 Dreamliner Polaris Transcon,SEAT 1A we all know EWR is a bad airport but on a United Mileage run decided to do a daytrip to SF Polaris is great but at EWR sad excuse for a United pop up lounge which has been pop up for 2 years Seats are MUCH NARROWER THEN 777300 Polaris but still conducive to sleep The entry to seat is about 30cm wide so it's actually difficult to get into and out of chair Crew remarked they have never seen such cramped narrow Polaris suites WiFi overpriced and not worth purchasing food OK and cheap nasty Californian wines on offer so I stuck to prosecco Connected to UA C LAX-EWR
Sep 2019,40,"Nice, for a 5-hour overnight flight","This flight was on time and uneventful, leaving 11:44 pm Alaska time and arriving Denver at 6:50 am MDT. No frills except United did provide free movies and TV series, and free non-alcoholic beverages."
Sep 2019,40,Surprisingly on time...,"My UNITED experiences are usually quite poor, but this time everything worked quite well and on schedule. Especially the gate agents were pleasant and professional. The seats themselves are getting smaller and smaller."
Sep 2019,50,Flying to Paradise Hawaii,The flight was so enjoyable. Thre were many new movies to choose from. The Staff were so nice and ready to please. Snacks were readily available as well as drinks. The Staff conversed with the travelers on the Plane. An enjoyable flight!
Sep 2019,10,Worst service,"So I am not a daily traveler I typically fly only a few times a year. However the service I received Was beyond poor. The whole airline seems to not be  InSync with one another, kinda like a brain not having control over the hand or feet! Everyone one was trying to blame the last representative about lost luggage or bad service! So if you are flying try a different airline!"
Sep 2019,10,"After several trips to India, I’m finished!","I’ve flown round-trip from New York to India twice now, and it has been the worst flight to India I’ve ever taken. On the last return, the flight was delayed four hours but the communication was confusing (app and website ETDs didn’t match, phone reps confused.) Even though I’d paid for a non-stop flight, the flight was re-routed with a stop in Germany, where we weren’t allowed to deplane, meaning 19-hours stuck in a plane with the absolute rudest flight crew I’ve ever encountered in many years of flying. I get that on these long-haul flights the crew is very senior, sometimes tired of flying, thinking about retirement, disillusioned with their jobs... But that’s no excuse for being insulting to customers. If you are flying to India from the States, pick another airline."
Sep 2019,10,Not comfortable at all. Terrible seats.,"Seats have HORRIBLE ergonomics. They were hard, stiff, and way too narrow even for a small guy like myself 5'6"". My back and bottom were burning by the time the flight ended and my father who has serious back issues was in agony. Ignoring the fact that this plane had brand new seats without TVs on a 2.5 hr flight I could not wait to get off that plane mainly because it was just sooo uncomfortable."
Sep 2019,50,Good trip,The flight was good the seats where a little tight. We had good leg room but we did up grade for it. The food and staff were great. The only complaint was the seats could be a little bigger and not so tight.
Sep 2019,40,Nice flight,"Was booked to fly United to Grand Junction, in part as United was one of the few airlines making my destinations. Went from Wichita to Denver, changed planes and onto Grand Junction. While it was a small aircraft, the personnel from gate agents to flight attendants and even the flight crew were polite and professional. The drinks and snacks were complimentary and served quickly, but it’s only a little over an hour from ICT TO DEN so they need to be quick. I would certainly fly United again, but airline travel isn’t what it used to be."
Sep 2019,20,Terrible experience,United used to be good. Now it seems the stewartists are kind of rude. The bag polices are ridiculous and the flights are rough. They charge a lot for seat selection and $60 for a tiny little bag that should've been a carry on but they woudn't allow it. They also make check in harder by forcing you to check bags. I travel super light and don't like risking lost luggage or delays waiting for luggage but unless I pay a lot more $$ then I can't do this anymore. It seems all of the American companies are about one thing: GREED. I will choose not to fly with United whenever possible. prefer Delta but just wasn't able to book far enough in advance to get what I needed.
Sep 2019,10,Engineer,"Seats are as narrow as spirit. Except for the leg room, it's not good. United reassigned my seats from window to middle."
Sep 2019,50,No problems,Not much to say. Flight was on time both ways. No issues at all. Foos not so great but stewards were always smiling and very nice. Really no issues at all and would fly United again. Round trip price was cheap cheap cheap
Sep 2019,20,Forget that Economy Class,"Horrible - never again will we fly Economy - at least not with UAL - this 5.5 hour flight that I thought I would be able to sleep on - was my worst experience. Could not sleep, the seat did not recline even one bit so we were totally upright and they did not allow us to use the overhead bin so our backpacks were under the seat, leaving us absolutely no room for out feet...ugh.."
Sep 2019,40,Great trip but no internet on this flight!,"It was OK, but no internet due to technical difficulties of the equipment. Pretty bad for a 3 1/2 flight on a major airline but they did give us FREE Direct TV!"
Sep 2019,40,One of the Best Big Carriers in the U.S.,"On average I fly on Untied about once per month. It's nothing to write home about, but I also rarely have any problems. It's reliable high volume carrier that can get you to just about anywhere on earth."
Sep 2019,10,World's Most Uncomfortable Airline,"I usually fly United because the short length of the flight and the low cost are attractive. This despite United's well publicized abuse, beating up doctors, suffocating pets...that United Staff pretends they know nothing about. This despite the most uncomfortable experience in terms of leg room and service and condition of the plane of any airline I have ever flown. Recently, however, United stopped flights from Sacramento to State College in the 7.8 to 8.5 hour range except for flights in the middle of night. So i flew American. What a difference! So much better than United!"
Sep 2019,30,Standard economy flight,"A Standard economy flight. Too bad that we were forced to do a check in at the desk, because the app didn't want to complete the process. Space is what you would expect from economy seats: tight and a bit hard, but pretty much usual for the class. Good in flight entertainment, but bring your over-ear headphones: the 777-200 is noisy."
Sep 2019,10,even being first class i could not enter the lounge with out there card,even with first class seat i could not enter the lounge with out there special card  what a crock..  i pay for the seat but not help.  then the flight was delayed and no help for agent..  not the nices people ...WE A RE SORRY. that is all was said to me
Sep 2019,10,Horrible customer service.,"Absolutely horrible customer service, spend over 3hours on the phone to still not have my issue resolved. Had a supervisor hang up the phone on me, completely disrespectful and rude. Do yourselves a favor and fly with a different airline. This company has 0 communication and people skills. What a joke. 0/10. I do not recommend this airline. Arrogant employees and no respect."
Sep 2019,40,Surprisingly Better This Time,"We were happier this year with the flights taken on United for our family vacation in September. We were pleasantly surprised with the leg room on our flight from San Francisco to Washington DC, Dulles on our way to NYC LaGuardia. The plane was a Boeing 777-200 and had seats that were positioned very nicely with very ample amount of legroom in Economy."
Sep 2019,10,Worst experience and appalling customer service,"I am absolutely disgusted at the lack of customer service I’ve received. We missed our connecting flight from Maui to Chicago at the fault of your airline after being assured the flight would not leave without the 22 people on the connecting flight. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 11:30 after being told the flight was being held for us, 22 people ran from one side of the airport to the other to get there at 11:34 and find out the flight left. I have had nothing but disappointment dealing with customer service. I’ve never had a more disappointing travel experience and such poor customer service! No one seems to be able to help us. We are now both missing work and haven’t had our clothes or toiletries AGAIN!! I’m usually not one to complain, but to say that I’m beyond pissed is an understatement... We booked our honeymoon trip with United Airlines. The flight there, we had a short layover in San Francisco and the flight was delayed going there so we were literally running to the connecting flight. We made the flight (barely) but our bags did not, so we spent the first 24 hours of our honeymoon without our clothes or toiletries. Flash forward 10 days to our flight home... same situation delayed flight with a short layover, 20+ people were catching the same connecting flight to Chicago. I went up to the desk and overheard several other people ask about if the flight would be informed of the delay. The employee at the United desk in Maui told me that with so many people on the flight they would be informed and that the flight would be held for the 22 people catching it. Flight landed and they switched our arrival gate to the other side of the airport and sat on the runway for a good 20 minutes before we have to wait for the whole plane to deboard. 22 people are RUNNING from one side of the airport to the other only to find out that they were not informed of the delay and could not wait 5 extra minutes for a good portion of their customers, and left without us.. customer service was a nightmare and did the bare minimum to help us with this situation that was completely their fault and one that could have been totally avoided. Now we are stuck in San Francisco for the night without our bags again.. We will NEVER fly United again!!"
Sep 2019,20,"Late, Cramped and Dirty","Our flight was an hour and half late leaving San Diego. We were put on the plane, then made to sit on it for that amount of time. Didn't they know it was broken before putting us all on board. The Captain was really nice and apologetic and as frustrated as we were. He was trying to get home. Luckily for us, our connecting flight out of Houston was equally as late, but we had a 23 minute walk to the next terminal. Seriously! We couldn't have been much farther away! But, we made it to Gulfport that night. Most other people on board weren't as lucky. Our return to San Diego left late because a passenger left their cell phone somewhere in the terminal and honestly wanted them to hold the plane so she could go find it. They didn't do that, but brought a policeman on board so she could fill out a piece of paper. Ridiculous to hold up an entire plane for one person who couldn't keep track of her cell phone. Also, the newly designed 800 Series is flawed. The controls for the tv screens are in the arm rests, so every time someone puts their arm on the rest, it either changes the channel or turns off the screen. It's really annoying! One more thing, the WiFi went out on our flight, so only the poor selection of movies were available."
Sep 2019,10,Joke show,"What a JOKE of an airline. I will never fly United again. Guess a backpack is considered too big for a carry on now? My fiancé being pregnant and suffers from anxiety was forced to check in her tiny carry on size bag with all of her necessities. Meanwhile I see others with massive suitcases bringing their bags on the airline. Every single staff member is rude and USELESS, almost purposefully NOT trying to help ANYONE. Don’t ever treat someone like they are dirt just because they didn’t buy your ridiculously expensive premium ticket. I would love to know how these people even got hired. What a sad company. I’ll say it again, NEVER flying United again. I still can’t wrap my head around their lack of care or empathy. No clue how these people look in the mirror daily."
Sep 2019,10,DON'T FLY WITH UNITED BECAUSE THEY DON'T FLY!!!,"Our flight did not leave on July 21 due to weather in New Orleans, but American took off the same time from another terminal and Southwest took off to New Orleans as well from Midway airport. So you are going to tell me you could not fly. Well you could have been nice enough to give us a hotel voucher and put us on another flight even with another airline. So upset with there customer service i promise to never get on there plane again. The flight they wanted to put us on was for the next night. How nice of them!!! Very unprofessional and ugly attitude."
Sep 2019,10,7 Hours on Phone trying to get to my vacation destination!,"I had plans to stay in luxury home in Crested Butte. First United delayed the flight without notification and could not help me find alternate days or routes to get to destination. I was on phone all day (holding mostly) trying to get help. Finally, we agreed to fly into an airport 150 miles from our destination which would cause us to take a shuttle to CB $450! We decided to take the hit and book. No sooner than I got off phone I received a text telling me the delayed flight HAD BEEN CANCELED! I wasted a day on the phone with United and did not get to CB!"
Sep 2019,10,Terrible trip,"Our 7:22 AM flight was cancelled at 9:30 PM the night before we were scheduled to leave. We were booked in First Class. It took us over 2 hours on the phone to get new flights. The computer scheduled (? this is what we were told) us for flights that would take over 14 hours. First Class was full on the 3 flights (we only had 2 flights on our original schedule). It was going to get us to Harrisiburg PA past midnight. Our orignial flight was to have gotten us there at 4:55 PM and we had dinner plans with our nephew, who is going to college in Harrisburg. After talking to 2 United Staff and looking on line, we were able to find flights to Harrisburg. We had to catch a ride to San Francisco instead of being able to fly out of Sacramento. We still didn't get First Class seats and we still didn'g get to Harrisburg until after midnight. This was a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!! United was of not help. We are still waiting for them to reimburse us for the Uber ride to San Francisco, the points back for the non First Class seats, the Car Rental changes, a meal, but they couldn't ever make up the missed dinner that we weren't able to have with our nephew. Our schedule has us leaving the next morning. Again, this was a TERRIBLE TRIP on United !!!"
Sep 2019,50,Poor Attitude and lousy flight scheduling,"I’ve heard it over and over, United Is known for delayed flights but our flight was not only delayed, our connection was completely changed from what we purchased to a longer layover and arriving from an overnight flight at 11 am instead of 7 am to our return destination. I usually look past delays because flights do that, it’s a technical process, but it’s true United is notorious for it. What really went wrong with this flight though was the rude male staff member at the boarding gate of OGG who without need or reason was unprofessional and rude and even after I bit the bullet and just tried to make it better, harassed me. I had my backpack to go under the seat and a brown sack with a delicate purchase from the gift shop and rather than being courteous and professional he was rude and demanding. I went to the counter to check my backpack which I could’ve done prior had I known a gift shop purchase would be such an issue to tuck under the seat as well & the guy in front of me clearly had a fee waived but my turn the woman allowed two individuals to interrupt my transaction. The two events weren’t related but United was making a pretty bad impression for themselves and customer service and respect. I had taken a wallet with a strap out of my backpack before checking it, to board with my personal info and cards. He continued to come and interrupt the woman taking my boarding pass and rudely told me I had to put my wallet in my brown sack because I currently had two bags (AKA my paper bag & my wallet). Heaven forbid my wallet tucked close to my body be an issue for boarding a plane. By this point it was hard to not speak up for myself and I told him It could fit in my bag and would fine. His response: “you need to put it in your bag right now”. My wallet couldn’t rest in my hand it HAD to be tucked into my little brown sack. My flight wasn’t full at all and many of the overhead bins were empty so I sat there unable to figure out why this man would be so rude and stressed when I gave him no disrespect or issue but he felt he needed to barrade me and create an issue."
Sep 2019,40,"One way fine, way back good be better",We had 4 flights total.  TLV-DC-SAT was O.K. The crew was nice and helpful. There was a Israeli crew member and it was considerate for the Israeli passengers.  SAT-EWD-TLV  We had big problem in EWD to TLV. The flight was delayed
Sep 2019,10,Given them plenty of chances...,"It's abundantly clear that customer service is towards the bottom of United's priorities, which is disappointing. While the pricing is competitive, the lack of customer focus is very concerning. After a 24 hour delay of my flight, I was offered no assistance, no options, and a very poor attitude by the person assisting customers at the check-in/help desk.  It seemed that the check-in counter was understaffed and not enough information was being passed on to the customers in line to shorten and end the process. A simple “we will not accommodate you in any way” to the people standing in line would have saved a lot of time. Or an explanation sent via email/text/app stating that United will not help with over-night accommodations or flight re-routing would have saved a lot of people a lot of time.  For a first-hand experience, I waited for 3.5 hours to speak with a United representative…he then told me that he could do nothing for me. It would have taken one United employee walking through the hundreds of people in line explaining that it was a “natural disaster” and no hotel accommodations or other assistance was being provided. That could have cut the line in half and resulted in many more happy customers. I hope that this customer service approach is implemented soon."
Sep 2019,50,Wonderful flight attendants,I have never been treated as well by any flight attendants as the 2 on this United flight.  They were so helpful and compassionate.
Sep 2019,40,"Very good service, flight late due to SFO runway construction","I did not like the fact that they boarded us, then said United needed the gate, so we were sitting in Chicago on the runway for over an hour. We we took off, the service was good and friendly. They made up for about 25 min of delay in the air."
Sep 2019,10,STOP LYING TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!!,"Hello United Airlines,PLEASE STOP LYING TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!!  I would like to state my immense disappointment in your airline.  I have been a frequent flyer with United Airlines but I’m afraid that may have to stop. On September 19, 2019 I had a flight going from Norfolk to Houston which was canceled due to the weather. I know United Airlines doesn’t control the weather so even though it was last minute, I understood.    After going up to the counter to get my flight changed, the agent told me all flights were full going into Houston the next day September 20, 2019 and I could only get on a flight for Saturday September 21, 2019. I begged the agent and explained that I don’t live in Norfolk and I know absolutely no one there- she said there’s nothing she can do.    Me needing to get to Houston by September 20, 2019 I decided to check for other flights with other airlines and to my surprise, both flights had seats available that the agent told me were full. I could not believe it so I tried booking it and of course the seats were available. I’m so disappointed because this is a huge scam! United Airlines has seats available and are out right lying to their customers. I went back to the agent and told her I saw seats available online with these same flights and she said there’s nothing she can do about it and continued to ignore me. I felt so disrespected and cheated! Instead of spending my money to book that same flight over, I just got a new flight with a different airline. Please stop lying to your customers."
Sep 2019,40,Flying to Hawaii,"Agent at the counter was actually rude and I even told her so.    For such a long trip there was no meal; when I decided to order some food, they had none to sell."
Sep 2019,40,Vijay Kaul,"Travelled UA 2224 to Las Vegas from SFO to attend an Expo. Took the late afternoon flight, which was about 20’ late due to runway work at SFO airport. The check in was smooth, the boarding was well coordinated, the announcements were clear and the aircraft was clean. The service on board, including alcohol(on pay basis) was great too. Well done UA."
Sep 2019,30,No room...,"United seems to get smaller seats every time we fly them! The steward/stewardess are hit and miss for friendliness...this flight was a bit 'cold'. Wish airlines would be for the people again, where is the love?"
Sep 2019,30,Could just ONE Flight Attendant Smile?,"You have a choice to make the most of your day. A smile goes a long way. However, we were met with either a blank stare or a stone face. No way were we getting headsets (they were out yet we were seated in row 24 - how could they be out already)? Could I have coffee? NO! How about ice? NO! I think if one does not enjoy their job they should work elsewhere. It's not necessary to scowl at everyone. We are crammed in like sardines and your crankiness just makes it worse."
Sep 2019,10,DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE.,United Airlines is the worse company I have ever dealt with. I have now been flying them to the Kentucky/Ohio area for a year and have had nothing but delayed and cancelled flights. In addition when they cancel a flight they basically leave you to figure out how to get to your destination. On a recent cancellation they offered me a flight the next day from Louisville to Denver to Las Vegas to Newark. That’s just ignorant. I declined and booked myself on an American flight from louisville to La Guardia. Given the amount of time and money I’ve lost in the past year I’m seriously considering driving the 11 hours rather than deal with United. Do yourself a favor and find another airline even if it costs you double.
Sep 2019,40,Business class on United,"Overall, price for business class seat which my size makes an unfortunate necessity was reasonable if booked at least 3-4 months in advance.Service was good. seats were acceptable but not fabulous if you are truly tall!    Staff were thoughtful and friendly and flight was largely on time.  From my area we are also fortunate that United has many direct flights."
Sep 2019,30,Business Class from London (LHR) to Houston (IAH),"We flew in Business Class on UA from London (LHR) to Houston (IAH) using UA miles. Being a 1K elite member and Million Miler, UA is no stranger. Everything is very average and familiar.    The seats don't provide much privacy. However, I do enjoy the bedding. I like the gel pillow and the blankets are very soft and lush.    We boarded on time and landed on time. This was about a 10 hour flight and I got pretty good sleep.    Food is nothing earth shattering. I had the beef ribs. Portions are big. Taste was not bad. Potatoes were pretty good as well. I skipped the lunch that was served before we landed. It was a cheeseburger. I do enjoy the ice cream sundae that gets served as part of dinner. That is the best part of the meal.    The other thing I need to mention is that the toilets never gets serviced. By the time you land, it is a mess. There is toilet paper on the floor and you are lucky to even have toilet paper to use."
Sep 2019,40,"Got there on time, was relatively comfortable","There's no way to really be comfortable on an overnight flight, and I wish we'd been interrupted less often, but altogether it was a good flight. The seat was ok, the power outlet worked (most of the time on domestic flights, I find they don't!), and we got there on time. I paid for the more-legroom seats and I'm glad I did. The flight attendants were helpful and we made it!"
Sep 2019,50,Good Flight,"As far as the airline goes, I had good flights. My all my flights departed on time and arrived early. I really liked that I got a text upon arrival first telling me which gate my connecting flight was leaving from, then which baggage carousel I needed to go to to collect my luggage."
Sep 2019,20,Mixed Feelings,"Usually Fly Delta but decided to give United a try as my company uses them as their preferred airline.I dare say i was a bit disappointed. on the app and website they ask for KTN which was provided. The flight out was fine but on the return from Barcelona, Spain my tickets did not have the TSA pre-check on them where my wife's did. Why bother asking for something if you are not going to apply it to the appropriate tickets. Really annoyed me. I think I will stick with Delta from now on."
Sep 2019,30,Non Eventful which is a good thing;,Nothing great and nothing bad happened on this flight. Just normal stuff. It was a smaller plane so it might be a little bumpier at times than the bigger ones. Non eventful is a good thing. Average flight.
Sep 2019,50,Good flight,"Very good service, food is only very ordinary, bordering on blah.....the business class lounge in houston is very good.  We also needed wheelchair assistance and this was readily available."
Sep 2019,50,Loved it,"Long time was not having United and it had surprised us so much.. Service was outstanding and the crew team was amazing. The most surprise we’d got in the end of flight -when landed and everybody was rushing to exit so as always-there was some traffic in an isle towards to exit. We had seat close to the back and the flight attendant opened the back exit and that was a great idea . Thank you, United !"
Sep 2019,10,So cramped and uncomfortable,"This flight takes about 7 hours, so in my book it’s long haul. But, since its domestic, the seats in economy are very cramped and uncomfortable. It’s a trial indeed to sit there for so long. If you want any food, you have to buy it if they have any left by the time they get to to you. I don’t know if it’s any better on any other USA airlines."
Sep 2019,30,Gets me from A to B,"Shortish flight (2.5 hours). Wish there was more arm rest space. Other than that, I think it was a pretty average flight experience."
Sep 2019,10,Attitude,So nice after waiting in airports and planes for 30 hours that I'm greeted with attitude from the first stewardess i encounter. I'll be sure to fly another airline next time. I'm tired but at least I'm being polite.
Sep 2019,40,On time and efficient,"This flight was on time and efficient. I had one connecting flight in Denver with a 50 minute layover. I was worried about any delays or my bags not arriving with me to my final destination. Everything went off without a hitch. I had time to cross the airport to my next gate and even had time to grab a bite of food to take with me on my next flight. My bags arrived with me at my final destination. I was served a partial can of soft drink on each flight along with a stroopwaffle cookie. Everything went well. I could have used more legroom. Inflight entertainment doesn't begin until 10,000 ft. I listened to an audiobook instead."
Sep 2019,50,A very nice flight!,"We booked many weeks in advance. A week ago United upgraded us to premium economy.    The flight was very smooth, and the service was perfect.    We looked at two films and had two excellent vegan meals. Without even asking, the stewards came every hour or so with drinks, so that we don’t suffer from dehydration. The 10 1/2 hours of flight went through easily."
Sep 2019,50,over all it was a good flight,"The attendants were attentive but there was a slight altercation with one of the people on the plane but the attendants and the pilot handled it , beautifully. The free movie and TV was a bonus. The ear bud jacks on both flights did not work properly ,but beverage and food the offerings were more than adequate. Plane was clean at the beginning of the flight, they must have an excellent clean up crew!  Overall the flight was good."
Sep 2019,20,Poor Service and lies,"Three hours before my flight is it leave UA sends me a txt saying my flight is delayed almost 3 hours d/t air traffic control limiting the number of planes able to land each hour due to weather conditions and/or flight traffic. They proceed to provide a link to show me other flight options available at that moment. The information provided by UA was false. Air traffic was reduced at SFO because of planned heavy maintenance on 1 of the 2 runways. This was information that UA would've been aware of for months. It had nothing to do with weather as the txt claimed. Instead of letting me know ahead of time and giving me the option to avoid connecting through SFO and allowing me to keep my plans, UA tells me about this 3 hours ahead of time and offers me only crappy connections to fill their other unsold seats on other less popular routes. Instead of telling me ahead of time and allowing me to choose a good flight alternative, UA screws me over to suit their needs. UA shows they have no consideration for their customer's plans or person. I ended up getting to my destination 6 hours late, missing my show and missing a night with my friends in Vegas. What crappy service from this airline. At least I wasn't dragged off a plane and injured like some of their other customers."
Sep 2019,10,Horrible but expensive,"Seats are much narrower than other airlines, movie choice was poor and equipment ancient (can't control movies eg fast forward/rewind etc), had to purchase food on the plane. I will never fly UA if i have alternatives."
Sep 2019,50,BEST FLIGHT,"I've flown to New York 10+ times in my life. This was the fastest, most comfortable trip of all! It took less than 5 hrs, the seats were comfy and the service was friendly."
Sep 2019,20,Terrible flight to London,"We used miles to fly the day flight to London, but were shocked by how poor the service was. We paid for Premium Economy seats -- the leg room was fine. But that's where the positives end. I can't say the flight attendants were mean, but they sure didn't want to be there. They did the absolute bare minimum, and pretty much let you know they'd rather be left alone. Which they literally were most of the way -- closing off the curtain in the galley so they could chat with each other. Food was terrible also -- the day flight serves breakfast, which is almost never good on any airline, but was awful here. We turned down the bagged sandwich ""snack"" before landing -- it didn't seem worth the effort. IFE was sad -- a surprisingly small selection of movies and shows. Finally, this was literally the first time I've ever flown international where the flight attendants couldn't be bothered to say goodbye at the door -- once again, they were too busy chatting. We're returning on Singapore Airlines, and expect a totally different experience. We'll avoid United as much as we can."
Sep 2019,50,Both leg of the trip departed and arrived on time and on schedule,"You are required to use the check in Kiosk and if you are an infrequent user, it can be a challenge. Worse, I saw just one grumpy staff member on the floor that was available to assist and he was overtaxed with the volume of passengers seeking help. Once that was over everything going forward was very efficient. Everyone else was very professional. The flights (including the connection in Houston) went remarkable well.."
Sep 2019,40,Excellent red eye flight.,"Really nice flight. Got an upgrade to Premium economy, so was extra special. Crew were friendly and helpful. 787 Dreamliners are superb planes - quiet, smooth and comfortable."
Sep 2019,20,Good Service or BadService they will take your Money,"United appreciates your money even if they do not give you the service you paid for.  paid for Premium Economy, good seats, yet we were in section 4 for boarding. by the time we boarded all the overhead bins were full, thus had to check my bag. Oh by the way same story line on the return trip."
Sep 2019,40,Houston to Auckland,The flight had a stop in LA first and it was comfortable but apron landing the next terminal was about a 5 block walk and I am 73 and having to go through customs again and being told to hurry by the person at the desk I would have to hurry was a bit much. Finally after doing a OJ Simpson through the 5 block trek I was a bit winded and was one of the last to board. I was in my seat for maybe 10 minutes and they closed the cabin door what would have happen if I missed my flight I don’t know. The flight from LA was wonderful plenty of leg room and 2 meals and free wine. All around I would fly again on this airline. I almost forgot you have to get a bus to go from one terminal to another and the bus game after about a 10 minute wait
Sep 2019,30,Make sure you know whether is United or United Express!,United flies regional jets to Jacksonville- either Republic or Commute Air. Republic is usually 76 passenger and the Comute Air is 56 which means you’re packed in a very small seat. I’m small and it felt tight. I also had to check my small carry on. No WiFi on either flight. I paid for Economy which ultimately only gave me a seat choice. I felt I was cheated with not being able to carry on.  Republic allowed my carry on and the seats were wider and more comfortable.  I have to say both flights were smooth.    Check your plane before you book!
Sep 2019,40,Our flight departed 45 minutes late. The flight crew was great.,"Our flight departed 45 minutes late, which put us in a pinch upon arrival at DC. The flight crew was great. No meals provided on flight."
Sep 2019,50,Two near-perfect flights,"We flew Chicago to Heathrow and then returned to Chicago from Dublin. Both flights were great. All of the flight attendants were helpful and attentive, and so were the staffers at O'Hare and also at Dublin airport. We couldn't have been more satisfied. Just an extra word, the flight attendants on our flight home from Dublin were nothing short of spectacular. The only one I remember is Dawn, but all of the FAs I came in contact with were extremely friendly, fun and gave us tremendous service. I know that United has had ups and downs, the this trip were all ""Ups""."
Sep 2019,40,"On time, good movies, ok food","Plane flight was smooth and arrived 25 minutes early. In Economy Plus the seats were fairly comfortable and had lots of leg room. There was a large inventory of relatively current movies to watch, but the music and podcasts choices were pretty useless. Stewards had a bit of an attitude. Still can't get the United stewards to put water into my water bottle at the beginning of the flight so I don't need to waste multiple plastic cups. Hindu dinner was ok but the dessert rice krispies-like crunch bar was inedible. Truly awful. Also, United has chosen to install a seat system that makes it virtually impossible to find the button to turn on the overhead light. After 2 years of customer complaints you would think they would do something about this. United's Star Alliance Lounge at the Charles de Gaulle airport i quite nice, including showers. However, the lounge signs lead you everywhere but where you need to go. They literally caused us to walk an extra unnecessary extra mile inside the terminal."
Sep 2019,40,Good Flight,"Overall we had a good flight f ok LAX to EWR. Took off on time, limited turbulence, and arrived ahead of schedule. Then, of course, the gate congestion at Newark cost us all the time we saved. Crew was peasant, but not overtly friendly. We were 8 rows into regular economy, and they had already run out of two of the four items on the food for sale cart. Poor planning."
Sep 2019,10,They think passengers are acrobats who can squeeze into the cube,"I have not seen such tiny space for seating yet, and I fly several times a year. While the leg room (or absence of such) was expected (sadly), but now they also shrunk seats on the sides, so I could barely squeeze into the seat. My elbows were sticking our though, and they foolishly placed entertainment controls on the hand rests where your elbows would be, so I kept inadvertently interfering with my neighbor' controls on the handrest - I just didn't have anywhere to put my elbows. This is crazy arrangement, especially considering the total lack of elbow room.  And of course the flight was late, which was not a surprise - it seems every flight was late when I used United."
Sep 2019,50,Staff was great in Newark,Had an early morning flight from Newark to Salt Lake City. The gentleman at the check in gate in Newark was terrific. Flight crew were very nice and attentive.    Flight back not as good an experience.
Sep 2019,50,Manchester to New York,"Pleasant enough flight. Free headphones, good choice of in flight entertainment    Free tea/coffee/juices    A hot meal an hour into the flight the an hour before landed served a light snack"
Sep 2019,50,United Airlines - always great service!,"United airlines has always provided great service to our family. The United app which allows check in is convenient not to mention informative as you receive consistent updates regarding gate changes and flight delays. We opted for the most affordable ticket price which was economy. You are limited in that you are only allowed one personal item (backpack or purse) it was not an issue for us. I do find that the $30 check in bag fee annoying but this is not only specific to United, all airlines charge a ridiculous fee for checking in bags."
Sep 2019,50,Great Experience,"Excellent service. The amount of space in the forward cabin of the 777 was amazing. Personal screens at every birth. If you're on a long flight, the seats recline to beds."
Sep 2019,50,Great flight if you don’t mind connecting in Newark,"I’m fortunate I’m united gold so I stick with them, even if it means connecting when I wouldn’t have to. Economy plus and lounge access make traveling quite nice. There are a number of nonstops from BOS but I’ve never tried."
Sep 2019,20,13 hours non stop,"This flight you are stuffed in the airplane lie sardines, and your legs and arms fall asleep if you dont get up to walk around. It is a true test of human endurance, especially when you are in stuffed in a tiny little seat. It was awful. The airline does the best it can to feed you and entertain you, but the plane itself is awful."
Sep 2019,50,Beyond expectation,"SAN Jose was fogged in, we diverted to Panama. United set us up at the Marriott bonvoy Oceanside, it was stunning. The arrangements were made immediately, as in there was no waiting for buses to pick up 200+ppl and we got to stay in a stunning hotel. Guys, the weather is not their fault, they didn’t have to do any of this. Very Kool of United."
Sep 2019,30,"Fine, not great","Flew Polaris, United’s international business class on a 777-200 with a 1 - 2 - 1 lay flat seat configuration. Seats were fine, everything worked. They have changed their toiletry purveyor from Cowshed to Sunday Riley. The food on United is not good, and really inferior to European airlines. I requested Vegetarian and apparently they have grouped all Vegetarian/Vegan/Asian Veg together to produce a meal that is satisfying to no one. Flight attendants were very nice, friendly and helpful, perhaps because they were Chicago-based. What I really cannot understand is why Lufthansa and Swiss can board a plane in 15-20 minutes and it takes United twice that time."
Sep 2019,10,Absolutely terrible company,"We bought 4 tickets and one of our party unable to fly, we asked if could change name or refund, they said NO! If we wanted to take another person in that place we would have to pay full fare again. We left booking as was incase our one person could come  We checked in on day and found that united airlines had already resold our spare seat! Both ways! On our return flight My son got stuck in middle seat of 2 other people when we specifically booked isle seats, my tv screen was broken and I was unable to watch anything at all, and the food that we were told we had a choice of (we were 2 rows from the kitchen!)  Had ran out so we got what was left, no cans of soft drinks were left so my son only had water myself and my partner got 1 drink of coffee we sat on runway for 2 hrs as there was no safety cards on board our plane but we never got anything for this not even a extra drink  I found the staff were very apologetic but the whole experience was disgusting  We paid £1200 for a seat both ways that this company then resold and made a profit on but that I had to pay back to the person in our party that was unable to go!  Would not recommend at all"
Sep 2019,50,Flight 40 from Newark was efficient and well run from the new sit down restaurant at the Polaris lounge to arrival in Ro,We were given plenty of advance notice to set aside time at the world class Polaris lounge at Newark Liberty or accept an invitation to the exclusive Classified restaurant in terminal C. We enjoyed a pre boarding dinner so we could sleep longer on the flight. Amenities are ample and pre-arrival breakfast satisfying. The bilingual staff was available for our every need.
Sep 2019,10,Trash,"No matter how much research is done, United will mess you over—not even their own employees were aware that someone flying basic economy cannot check in online. You are forced to wait to check in until their employees swipe their badge to MAKE SURE your carry on is small enough. I will never fly United again after being forced to wait hours for an employee to swipe a badge and not being able to enter the airport security without a ticket. Has united heard of a layover?! Oh wait, no employees are available except for baggage handling because they don’t know how to match their customers with their own dang checked in luggage. Idiots and idiocy. Go bankrupt quickly."
Sep 2019,50,United Airlines Best Airline to fly....,"Flew United Airlines for our trip to the Football Hall of Fame. I typically fly United Airlines whenever I travel and this was not exception. United is usually on time with their departures and if not they try to make up the time in flight. We had a smooth ride, the attendants were great and the overall flight was wonderfully uneventful!    Our pilot, on the return flight, got us home in great time and I was able to beat the holiday traffic, driving home"
Sep 2019,50,Good direct flight,This is a very long flight (14.5 hours). The airline manages to make the flight as comfortable as possible for the passengers. The entertainment system had a huge variety of options and was individually operated. The food was quite good. The flight arrived on time. Good experience.
Sep 2019,30,Good flight,"The flight was OK. Service was OK and timing was good. One thing that was not great was that the airplane was not big, thus, after boarding about half of the passengers on the plane they announced that there is no more luggage storage room on the plane so the rest of the passengers had to check-in their hand luggage / carry-on luggage. People who planned on specific items being with them on the plane had to manage without them."
Sep 2019,50,very good flight,The flight was very well organized. It left slightly late but arrived on-time. The service was good. The entertainment system was great.
Sep 2019,20,First class tray table stuck,"Couldn’t pull out tray table in row 1. Flight attendant couldn’t either. My wife asked for headset and attendant didn’t ask if I wanted one, just walked off brought it to her and when she asked for one for me he glared at her without responding but did bring me one. Had to put my carry on in bin 3 since 1 and 2 were full. Announcements difficult to understand"
Sep 2019,10,"I thought I was in coach. Seriously, this is cant be business class...","The steward explained ""This isn't business class, this is Polaris!"" excuse me it looks like some sort of coach plus with a blanket I said. You cannot be serious. All of the build up is a lie. It was hands down the worst business class flight ever from seating to food to service. God awful and what's worse it was from Japan to SFO, SFO to Denver, Denver to DFW. I feel like I walked the whole way! I thought they improved according to the Polaris build up but I was wrong, United isn't as good as Continental was. I shall never fly again on United. I'' use my miles only on international partners, life lufthansa m(and they stole my coat in business class)"
Sep 2019,30,On the cheap,"This was my first time flying basic economy. No assigned seat till you get checked in at the airport ( online check in NOT available for this cheaper way to go) only one personal item that must fit under the seat in front of you, that means no normal size carryon even. I brought a backpack. Since I was only staying overnight at my destination this was ok, not great but tolerable for a short flight and only an overnight."
Sep 2019,40,Early arrival,Flight left on time and we had an early arrival in SMF. Snacks included biscoff cookies and stroopwafels. Flight personnel were personable and professional. Had love direct tv in flight as well as movies I could watch on my iPad.
Sep 2019,30,Getting back to America,The plane was on time and the flight went well. The food was horrible. Got a think that kinda looked like a taco. It was filled with red sauce and some veggies. Tasted horrible. Got enough to drink which is a plus. Had a person next to me whose body didn't invade my seat!! Therefore it was a good flight.
Sep 2019,40,Flying to Europe,"The flight was on time which is always a good thing. Luckily I was able to get a window seat and there was no one in the middle seat, so it was relatively comfortable. Still too little leg room. The food was good and service very nice. Saw a pair of movies too. All in all a very good trip."
Sep 2019,20,Poor baggage handling,"Flights were rough due to weather, not airlines fault at all, everything departed on time without a hiccup. However upon arriving home, we discovered our brand new luggage had been soiled and broken during transit. A wheel missing, and the suitcase was caked in dirt and smut. Highly disappointed in the handling of our luggage."
Sep 2019,10,Tropical Storm - Houston,So just tried to get a refund for this flight in order to avoid flying into a tropical storm. United refused to do so and only offered a credit. The supervisor I spoke to was hostile and unhelpful. I think this is irresponsible and unsafe and as a regular traveler I will no longer do business with them.    Marriott on the other hand was more than happy to refund the hotel room and will continue to be a go to for me.
Sep 2019,50,Great Flight,Great flight with excellent inflight service. Very good meal choices to chose from. Flight departed on time
Sep 2019,30,so so,"Because my hubby wanted a break partway thru our trip, we picked the United Airlines flight that went thru Chicago. First of all, we had scheduled a 10:30 a.m. flight which was changed to a 7:30 a.m. flight which meant we had 4 hours in Chicago! I wish I could have switched our 2nd leg as easily as they did! The attendants were very nice, the plane clean BUT no screens to view movies, no free ear buds - it was just money, money, money. Thankfully I had my own items but this has happened to us before. We flew back from Aruba on United and was SO disappointed (coach) The seats were squished together and my knees touched the back of the seat in front of me!!! Thankfully my son wasn't traveling with us as he's 6'3"" - I'm just 5'7""!!!! And no frills at all. Very sad."
Sep 2019,50,Our birthday gateway,We flew united premium economy and so glad we did seats are much comfortable and more leg room we had a great fly no complain and really satisfied with the whole service experience will continue using unite for future trips
Sep 2019,50,Great flight,"The meal was great, the staff was super friendly, watched a good movie and flight was on time. They offered endless cocktails and made me feel very appreciated as a customer."
Sep 2019,20,Dreading flight back to EWR,Flew premium economy UA #19 (Newark to Milan) on 9/16/19. Seats are like sitting on a park bench--extremely uncomfortable. Aisles are so narrow--whacked several times on aisle by service cart and coffee pot flew off cart and landed right next to me & flight attendant said oh that happens all the time.
Sep 2019,20,United Has Issues,"Old equipment, with service in first class rude. I felt they were put out doing their jobs. Asked for head sets, they responded slowly and did not acknowledge my request at all.  I can’t imagine what coach class was like. Generally, not a friendly experience on all 4 segments of my flights. Flying should be a pleasurable experience, not a military drill with staff acting superior."
Sep 2019,10,NIGHTMARE,Standing at the airport in Houston waiting in line FOREVER because they are UNDERSTAFFED.  How is it possible that this HUGE COMPANY doesn’t have enough people at the kiosks? There are TWO people working. I here are 10 people who have been waiting for 30 minutes with no movement. NIGHTMARE
Sep 2019,50,Return trip,As always I have had another excellent trip via united Airlines whether it be first class or economy. The service and staff are always very friendly & helpful.
Sep 2019,40,Excellent until we arrived at the gate,Wonderful in cabin service and arrived to ORD on time. Plan for the ORD to let you down. PM arrivals rarely happen as planned. Twenty plus minutes to get a gate. We had an opportunity to have a stellar experience but we didn't close
Sep 2019,50,Great customer service via Facebook,"Had to contact United about a change to a flight. Spoke to the call centre at length but got stuck in a bureaucratic black hole. Decided to message them on Facebook to see if they had more pragmatism and was blown away at both the speed and quality of their response. Not only were they faster at replying than I could keep up with, they were also articulate, friendly, smart (I didn't need to explain things more than once before they were on top of it), didn't hand me off to anyone else and were able to use common sense to sort things out. 10/10 service via Facebook and more companies could follow their example."
Sep 2019,10,Baggage costs,Might be in the small print but costs $60 each way for luggage. Is it just me or shouldn’t airlines expect you to have luggage When You Go On You’re HOLIDAY. Now been delayed 2 hours so far on return journey and cannot find anyone who works for United airlines. Will not recommend.
Sep 2019,50,Never Flying United Again,"Flight never left kept getting delayed ... we almost missed our connecting flight to vegas and we were lied to, they said that Denver airport was closed... which it wasn't, we got in a car and drove to make the flight."
Sep 2019,40,12 hrs of hydration,"Flight was about 12 hrs. & was surprised at all the food, snacks & drinks that were offerred. Expected to have lunch only, but also had breaksfast & in between snacks & drinks. Coming around often with drinks was very good."
Sep 2019,40,Polaris is tops,"United has really stepped up their business class with Polaris. Comfortable, thoughtful seat layout. Decent food. Quite a few entertainment options! One caveat: United business class product is really inconsistent depending on aircraft so you may be disappointed flying on a non-Polaris aircraft."
Sep 2019,20,Boeing 737-800/900 United seats horrible,"Airbus has the seat comfort hands down!!! These look nice, clean, and new, but they are ridiculously uncomfortable for even a 1.5 hour flight. They might recline all of 5 degrees."
Sep 2019,40,Making improvements,"We were able to sit in a new class of seats on our flight called Premium Plus. It is a step above Economy Plus. The seats are bigger and they incline a little more. They also have a foot rest. According to the information these seats will eventually include meals served on china, and amenities. This is for international flights. The seats were certainly very nice!"
Sep 2019,10,Worst flight experience of my life,Cannot say enough bad things about this experience! They delayed us for HOURS only to take us to Chicago after the last flight to Cleveland had left for the night. There was no time to even go to the one marginal restaurant in KC because they dragged it out 30 minutes at a time. My colleague and I literally rented a car at midnight and drove the 6 hours home. Awful experience!
Sep 2019,50,Las Vegas Outbound Flight Excellent.,"I've travelled between Denver and Las Vegas several times and I gave up on ANY discount airlines NOW that I have Premier Access on United. Even at McCarran Airport I get through check and baggage delivery as well as security screening without incident with United's help. I also get to borad and to deplane first with it since I NOW travel First Class.    I had an Airbus AGAIN for my return flight and I'm SURE that the seats are bigger as well as more comfy than on a 737 especially in First Class. I believe that the flight attendants are just fine. There's always premium liquor up fromt. There are fewer 1st class passengers than on a 737 SO you get faster service too.    Even for a flight less than 2 hours in the air, I prefer a premium cabin experience. It's quieter and more luxurious. I got 2 snacks since the man sitting next to me DIDN'T want his. I felt rested when I returned for the car trip back home. I fly United almost exclusively NOW."
Sep 2019,30,787 from LAX to MEL,OK- miss some of the amenities typically found on international travel  Food was oK  Crew was good - always busy and in a hurry  Wine selection was not gr  Those high tech windows are not great- thought we were in heavy fog- but just the windows  Got here early  Inadequate seating at LA for a wide body
Sep 2019,50,Polaris is nice,"Finally caught on that by using the United App I can see what seats are available and what classes are sold out. Used this to my advantage to upgrade my son and I from economy to economy plus, but since economy was fully booked it bumped us up to Polaris, very comfortable and great service."
Sep 2019,50,Las Vegas Inbound Excellent!,"My trips to Las Vegas are becoming more frequent as I edge towards retirement SO the flights are becoming part of the experience. Luckily I have Premier Access Silver {approaching GOLD as we speak} SO I had NO problems with check in and baggage at the airport. I was in Line 1 SO I got to board and to exit first group.    They ALWAYS have excellent liquor in 1st class. There are fewer 1st class passengers on an Airbus SO the attendants get to you QUICKLY. This was a smaller Airbus BUT the seats appeared bigger and more comfy than on a 737. They served a hot muffin / scone on this early flight which tasted great.    An Airbus appears quieter than a 737 SO as soon as I had a drink, coffee and my snack, it was a nice snooze and I was in Vegas before I knew it. Overal, even for a short flight of less than 2 hours, I would STILL opt in for 1st Class IF it's this nice."
Sep 2019,30,"But for one person, a very bad experience","This concerns aflight that was supposed to leave CMH on 8/30/19. After we boarded the flight (reasonably on time) we were told there was a mechanical problem. After sitting on the plane for at least an hour, we were told to get off the plane as it was going to take longer than expected to deal with the problem. We were supposed to have updates while on the plane, but none were forthcoming. At this point we had no chance of making our connection in Chicago. As I was with someone with mobility issues, we were the last off the plane. When we entered the airport, there was a line of some 100-150 people in line looking to make alternate arrangements. By the time the plane was ready to leave, I was still 10-12 people back in line with no chance of making arrangements, and no alternative other than getting on the plane and seeing what would/could be done. I failed to mention that one (yes 1) person was assigned to alternate arrangements. Left no choice, we got back on the plan and proceeded to Chicago, not know if or when we would receive alternate arrangements. We were assured, several time by flight attendants that there would be someone ""waiting at the gate"" to handle alternatives. Not! The one person I did speak with was not only somewhat unpleasant, but made it clear there was nothing she could do, that I would have to go to customer service for any assistance, not even bother to say where that might be. Fortunately the person pushing my wife's wheelchair know and we proceeded there immediately. When we got there and someone noticed the wheelchair, they sent us to an area that handled people with mobility and other challenges. That was when we met the one person who made our day. I wish I knew his name. He greeted is with a smile and asked for our previous information. He was looking at alternatives before I had the time to ask. When he looked up, I asked about Alaska Airlines as I knew they had flights going that would get us there last 2am the next day vs 7-8pm on the 30th as originally booked. He had us on flights in a matter of minutes and gave us paperwork that would result in boarding passes for both flights. Before we reached the gate, he was coming the other way with boarding passes in hand. This one person deserves a 5+, the rest, maybe a 2. May God bless him. If only I knew his name I would find a way to thank him and advise United of the one truly helpful person we met that day. United, bah."
Sep 2019,40,Flight to Ireland,It was fine. Food and service was good. Plane was completely full.Attendants were pleasant. Smooth flight and safe landing.
Sep 2019,40,good flight,"I have flown United/Continental for many years and although I hear and read stories, it has never happened to me. I have had weather trouble and delayed by weather trouble but that is not the airlines problem."
Sep 2019,10,United airlines is Horrible,"United airlines is unprofessional and worst to treat customers. I do not recommend anyone to use airlines. Very cheap customer service. I am Very disappointed. I was travelling from Cincinati to SFO, with out any reasons flight got delayed 2 days Literally I was stuck in airport and customer service is very rude to customers and I am asking them to refund my amount back to me . They are not responding properly. Don't use this airline, I am sure you will be disappointed your whole journey"
Sep 2019,40,Decent flight,Flight to Nashville was good. No real complaints. This was my first time flying United express and I actually liked the smaller plane. We did have to wait awhile for the ramp crew in Nashville so we could get off the plane. about a 20 minute wait.  Flight back to Houston was fine. Another United express flight. Our flight was delayed about 2 hours due to earlier flight delays. we were notified a couple hours before the flight and after arriving it was delayed another hour. Inconvenient but nothing drastic.
Sep 2019,20,"Update on United Polaris Travel date May 6, 2019","Dated: September 16, 2019  I wish to add to my previous review of last week titled: “United Polaris did NOT honor special dietary requests!” Here it is:  Before we de-board the plane I asked the flight attendant how can we make sure our special dietary needs will be honored on our return flight. She told me if I could give her our Return flight number, date of departure and departure city she will make sure the Kitchen manager be informed about what happened on “this flight” and that our dietary request be honored on our return flight. I wrote all the requested information and handed it to her.  Guess what!? They DIDN’T HONOR our request again!! I gave my review and feedback upon our return to the States. I didn’t hear a word nor an acknowledgement from United Airline!  I thought all of you should know."
Sep 2019,50,great flight,"made trip in three hours nineteen minutes, fastest flight ever, usually takes around 4 hours. crew was friendly and terrific"
Sep 2019,40,Good and comfortable,Good timing. No delays. Cheerful staff. Nothing exceptional that took place. Just happy to be on this airline.
Sep 2019,20,Worst International Service ever,"After all the hype about Polaris Service, I was looking forward to a truly unique business class experience on United. Other than the Polaris Lounge on the C Concourse at O'Hare Airport in Chicago, it was a complete disappointment. The plane had not been configured to the 'new' Polaris system, though promised at the time the reservation was made. Yes. I am very fortunate to be able to travel to and from Europe on a regular basis, for work, and I will never fly United international service again."
Sep 2019,40,Flight back from Greece,"Although the flight was bumpy, the service was good. I always try to fly United Airlines, since I have frequent flier miles."
Sep 2019,10,First Class,So we purchased full First Class tickets after checking United website thinking as you would that first class would give you access to the airline lounge.....well what a JOKE!  I have flown many airlines and to not allow a first class passenger access just defies logic.  I even sent United an email and 9 days later still no response.  NEVER AGAIN UNITED
Sep 2019,30,Standard Performance,"There was nothing noteworthy on this flight, but we arrived on time, our luggage arrived with us, the experience was entirely average with nothing to complain about except the standard-issue narrow and short seating. It was not possible for me to sleep on this flight because I was in uncomfortable positions."
Sep 2019,50,Family Reunion,"Trip was awesome, no delays, the weather was good and the entire trip was peaceful. I was able to get a nice nap too."
Sep 2019,40,Smooth,"United is my preferred airline...I do not fly any other and this time they got it right. Smooth flight both ways...and I travel from EWR-IAH every couple months.    I know sometimes United gets a bad rep, but I will continue to be loyal to the airline as they tend to do better more often, than not."
Sep 2019,50,Continually updated about flight delays due to runway repairs,United kept me updated on possible flight delays because of the close of one runway for repairs that started the morning I left. This was most helpful.
Sep 2019,40,Better than I expected,"After reading negative reviews and comments, I was skeptical about my flight experience with UA. This was the first time I traveled with UA for an overseas flight. Service is not bad, flight crews were friendly. Overall experience was good, I was happy with my choice of airline."
Sep 2019,50,Really great airline,We travelled from Melbourne Australia to Salt Lake City and all 4 flights were just great. All staff were older than usual but were amongst the most professional and friendly I have ever encountered. They made the flights an absolute pleasure. So polite and helpful. All flights arrived early. The planes were clean and comfortable. The food was good and plentiful. There were also snacks to purchase should you require. Entertainment good. Free wifi on board. Amazing value. We travelled in premium economy which was very comfortable and worth’s the extra. I was really surprised by the quality of everything and will book with United again in a heartbeat.
Sep 2019,30,Long international trip,It was ok  Do not offer some stuff others have: disposable tooth brush (would be nice on a 15 hour flight  Food was ok  Why wake us up at 7:30 am in LA and early evening in Australia for a very small ham and cheese sandwich nice PR. But Why.  Ur
Sep 2019,30,It’s like a big greyhound bus,OK  Crowded plane  Inadequate seating in the concourse for a 777 - 200  Left on time  Had to wait 20 minutes for a gate at LAX  Hope all is well
Sep 2019,50,16 hour is a long time but it was really a good flight,"Our seats were technically the new Polaris Class which sort of a combination of business and first class but TA does not list that separately here.    Our flight boarded quickly and we left on time. Within an hour or so they were taking lunch and drink requests. I chose a pan seared hake with vegetables and rice, my wife had the beef short ribs, The salad before the main course was sort of an Asian inspired one and also a nice large shrimp cocktail also was good. Wine choices were decent.    I was not impressed with the IFE, the choices were pretty bad but maybe it's just me because I don't enjoy Marvel comic book movies which were all out this summer. But even the older classic movies choices were pretty boring. I mostly read books.    Flight was not too bumpy, only a few spots. I wish the crew would not assume everyone wants to sleep after lunch and dim the tinting windows down and lock them in that setting. I had to ask twice for them to unlock my windows so I could make them brighter.    A good flight but for $3600 everything other than the weather should be."
Sep 2019,50,"Long trip, fantastic Service",This was actually my first trip to Europe and even with long hours of travel found no delays with connections and weather. Service was excellent by flight attendant team. I would definitely fly again with United and fully recommend the airline.
Sep 2019,40,Great service,Going home was a treat especially being treated by name as the food was being served. My drink and meal was complementary due to my K1 statis. The attendants were extremely polite and friendly. The flight was comfortable and very timely. A half hour early upon arrival.
Sep 2019,20,Budget Airline Experience for a Premium Airline Price,-Economy passengers must check any carry on ($30 each way) that is larger than a personal item. Staff made me check a 40 liter backpack while they did not enforce that policy for other passengers  .  -No inflight entertainment  - You must pay for Wifi  -You must pay for any food that is not a single cookie.  - im 5'10 and I did not feel like I had an adequate amount of leg room.
Sep 2019,20,"Cancelled on short notice, unintelligible options offered","Our flight from SFO to MSP changed from 12:30 pm departure to 8:30 am departure, then was cancelled outright less than 12 hours before the flight. The worst part were the options offered to us. The email listed Newark and Dallas/FW as alternatives departure cities to SFO. What the heck? After a LONG time on the phone with a rep, ended up on a 6:20 am flight out of SFO, which required us to drive through the night (we were coming from Fresno area) without going to bed. Kinda like an old-fashioned Vegas redeye experience."
Sep 2019,10,Horrible,Horrible flight to newark. Literally waited 45 minutes on the plane after we landed. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.
Sep 2019,40,United: SFO-Lihue Very Good,"We were a bit concerned as to whether this flight would be on time given the number of late and cancelled flights in San Francisco due to the runway repairs. We were fortunate. The flight left on time and arrived in San Francisco a few minutes early. The flight attendants were professional and attentive. The gate representative in Lihue was incredibly friendly--very helpful in terms of checking in our suitcases and, most surprisingly, walking through the passengers at the gate to thank us for flying with United. She at least briefly put a very human touch on an airline that is not typically know for being user friendly.    Why am I not rating the flight as excellent? Simply because the leg room in business/1st class is not very good. Otherwise, the in-flight experience was very good."
Sep 2019,40,Nice flight. Courteous staff and on time.,"The flight was on time, staff were great and we had a decent experience. Economy seating is a bit tight, but the plane was not full, so we could stretch out a bit."
Sep 2019,10,Terrible experience with United Airlines,"My flight was delayed 1 hour and 45 minutes, so naturally I delayed my arrival time by that much. When I arrived to the airport (about an hour before in a very small airport with only 5 gates), there was no ticketing agent to give me my boarding pass. I talked to multiple people to see what was going on and was told to just wait and keep knocking on the door behind the counter. When an agent finally showed up, my flight had already boarded. I was told that even though my flight had been delayed, that I am expected to be there 2 hours before the original flight time. Which for me would have meant being there at 3:30 for a flight at 7:17. Also, they had sent a message informing us that the flight was delay to 7:17 but actually had the plane boarded and closed up by 6:50.    Also on a side note, all 3 flights I had on this trip were delayed."
Sep 2019,40,"Nice plane, and staff","It was a nice flight, although delayed for 4+ hours due to storms in Chicago. The flight entertainment was nice as were the snacks on the plane. Nice crew.."
Sep 2019,30,Agents not very friendly,"Agents were not very helpful answering questions. Seemed like all they wanted was for you to hear something, anything, and walk away! Very rude!"
Sep 2019,10,Prepare to hate your life.,"I am just trying to fly home with my dog. I want to go to work tomorrow. Instead, I now have to bum off of friends I have in the area (luckily!) because no matter how clearly I tried to state my intentions that I want to book my pet on my two return flights, and that intention be clearly repeated back to me, and yet here I am sitting on a God damned bench outside because they still somehow after clarifying with me booked the animal on the wrong flight. I don't know this until I try to check in. I try to check in, am told that with only 30 minutes before my flight begins boarding, there's an error. My dogs not on this flight. I call customer support, because of course the woman in front of me is for some reason powerless to just move over a pet to a new flight. I clear the issue up, somehow, the woman on the phone was actually able to do something, and not with but a single second to spare. My flight just began boarding. I walk up to the counter, explain the issue was just fixed, and I would like to check in. She says, ""I'm sorry I can't do that."" I'm not allowed to grab my ticket, walk through security, and take my flight home to my new job and home because the plane is already boarding??? What kind of nonsense is this that I can't check in with 10 minutes to spare to board my plane????? I am literally going to dedicate the next several years of my life to dissuade anyone and everyone from using United Airlines. Like other passengers have said, they treat you like luggage. How can it be so hard to schedule a flight with a dog?"
Sep 2019,50,Great set of flights today. BWI to ORD and then onto SAT.,"Great set of connecting flights, even though we were delayed in ORD. Great set of communications from all the united staff. Evveryone was very friendly and helpful."
Sep 2019,20,Flight attendants need some training,"On Friday, September 13, we flew United from Dublin to Newark on the 9:30 am flight. The flight attendants were just not customer service friendly. They were condescending and rude in the way they spoke to customers and their attitudes were poor as well.  Only one young lady was attentive and offered a smile but the others were just sad. They did not smile and I was taken aback at the way they addressed some of the passengers. Some retraining would greatly improve their skills. I understand they do not have an easy job, but it is the job they are getting paid to do. Those skies were not very friendly last Friday."
Sep 2019,40,"On time, good service, friendly inflight crew","On time, good service, friendly inflight crew. Travel is tough but people should have realistic expectations. Economy seats will never be comfortable on any airline. Pleasant flight with frequent beverage service to help you stay hydrated. Food is average but on par with every other major airlines coach offerings. Large selection of inflight entertainment both seat-back and streaming. 787 has nice cabin humidity, low cabin altitude, and is very quiet."
Sep 2019,50,International,Super consistent service and product from UA. Their app is easy to use and the waiting areas & staff seem to be engaged. the service was superior to Lufthansa. I continue to be impressed by United Airlines.
Sep 2019,50,United Again,"I reviewed United when I went out to Hawaii a couple months ago. Highlight of that trip was the uncomfortable seats that made sleeping difficult. This trip was significantly better.    Departure trip: Nothing to complain about or praise, pretty standard trip.    Returning trip: Had an interesting conversation with the flight attendant, Jeff. We're both students and had family members die from cancer."
Sep 2019,20,Flight delay caused rebooking that wasn’t necessary,"The first leg of our international flight was delayed. First delay notice made it impossible to make our connection in D.C. after consulting with two different United Representatives the best they could come up with was either rebooking from the origination point, overnight in Cincinnati, or travel to D.C. arrive late and spend the night there flying on to Portugal 24hrs later. We elected to fly the first leg and booked a non-refundable hotel reservation at the Dulles airport. Luggage was retagged for Dulles. Delayed flight was later upgraded but still not enough time to make the connection to Portugal. This is where “Under promise and over deliver” is a failed strategy. Flight arrived 20 minutes ahead of ETA which gave us 30 minutes to make our connection to Portugal, a good thing. Our bags arrived three days later and we paid for a hotel at Dulles we didn’t need. Thanks United for added stress and expense. The only happy takeaway is that we arrived as originally scheduled in Portugal and didn’t have to carry luggage to our rental."
Sep 2019,50,Comfort,Sleeper seats good service on time food was pretty good flight attendants were very attentive I would recommend this flight
Sep 2019,10,This is the worst airline avoid at all cost.,If you want to be jerked around and treated like a piece of luggage UNITED is your airline. Beware when we booked a economy flight I did not see any fine print that stated we COULD NOT HAVE CARRY ON LUGGAGE. When we showed up at LAX with one piece of carry-on luggage UNITED said we must pay $200 for one small carry-on bag.  It is also the smallest amount of legroom I've ever seen on any airline. I am size-12 mens shoe and I have to turn my feet sideways to put them on the floor. This was the only non-stop flight we could find. Our policy going forward will be to never-ever fly United. Absolutely the worst airlines ever. Fly Delta instead. American airlines sucks too.
Sep 2019,40,Pleasant flights,We decided to fly so we wouldn't be tired when we arrived. The flights were on-time and the personnel we encountered were friendly and helpful. The airport in Flagstaff is tiny but we enjoyed the ease of use. We will use United in the future.
Sep 2019,40,flight delayed other than that everything went well,"the flight was 1/3 full. best flight in a long time. I had three seats to myself. I had a can of apple juice. I selpt, we arrived."
Sep 2019,40,Flight to Quebec,The flights were delayed by bad weather in Newark but they did try to make it right. Adding on a crew and additional flight
Sep 2019,40,Nice flight!,Nice daylight flight. The Polaris it's not the most comfortable chair in Business Class but it is ok for a long flight. Much better than the economy for sure.
Sep 2019,40,What Happened to Meals?,"It's too bad that so many people express frustrations with their flights, no matter the carrier. Our flights tend to be largely uneventful, except for the typical annoyances. I can understand where airlines need to cut costs. But on cross-country flights, they may get better reviews if they tried to go a little above and beyond. We boarded our recent flight at 11:00 and arrived in NJ in the early evening... famished! The stewards were kind enough to offer us multiple bags of snacks, but that only goes so far. Of course, we could have purchased a meal for $10. But the tickets were over $750 each! I'm going to look at flight amenities more carefully next time."
Sep 2019,40,Seamless Fight,"I know United has been taking it in the chin but I thought this flight was about as seamless as it can get. Easy organized boarding, left on time, no delays and a clean aircraft. Want in Economy Plus or anything fancy and I had plenty of room. Would recommend and fly again"
Sep 2019,20,Extortion and lack of customer service,"So it appears United has added some cut rate fares to attract flyers. What you don't see in the small print is you don't get to pick your seats (even when you purchase multiple at the same time) and you have to pay for a checked bag.    I had to actually call another airline to secure our seats even though the flight was booked thru United because they were subbing it out to another carrier.    Worse is when something goes wrong.  One leg was delayed significantly causing us to miss our final flight.  They were quick to put us up in a hotel, but when I contacted them about the personal expenses I lost (you can't cancel some hotels / car reservations in under 24 hours) they directed me to a web site that will respond in up to 21 days. No one in customer service could or wanted to provide any type of assistance other than a web site.    The last thing I feel is that this airline values its customers.    Sad to see the service industry decline."
Sep 2019,10,GA,United airlines are unprofessional and sucks. I do not recommend anyone to use them. Very cheap customer service and non reliable stuff. Their policies of refund are set to take advantage of their repetitive customers. Very disappointed. (Rate is actually below zero but that’s what is available here)
Sep 2019,20,Checking in at Aruba Airport a Nightmare,When leaving Aruba the advice is to get to the airport 3 hours in advance of your flight. I recommend that you heed this advice.  For our 1:10 PM fight we arrived at the airport at 10:00 AM to find only one line and one United desk open. It took forever to get up to the desk and get our baggage taken care of. Thankfully we had printed our boarding passes at the hotel or the process would have been longer.  It is ridiculous that Unite has only one desk and representative to take care of everyone. I know this is not an isolated incident as the same thing happened two years ago when I flew United out of Aruba.  JetBlue had many representatives there and I will be thinking about flying with them the next time I go to Aruba.
Sep 2019,30,Efficient but delayed somewhat,"United is a good airline with polite enough staff but our outbound flight was delayed and the hidden charges are not welcome. Canada/America flights seem to charge for checked luggage and added extras on board. Not full service when flying ""domestic"" which is a shame. The boarding process is lenghty and not very organised despite having boarding zones. Always very crowded even on short haul flights. Not a completely bad airline for the americas though."
Sep 2019,40,"Nice flight, cordial flight attendants.","Nice flight, although we left 1 hr late, so sitting on the plane that long was not fun. We had the very back row (row 35)where the seats do not recline at all. Not the most comforable.    My wife was in the middle next to a large person who took up more than their own seat. I discreetly asked the flight attendant if there was another seat available and she found 1. So my wife was moved to a window seat in row 8 which she liked.    We arrived in time to get to our connector flight as the pilot made up some time since we left way behind schedule.    Thank you United Airlines for having very well-trained flight attendants!"
Sep 2019,10,United airlines is HORRIBLE,I had to attend my grandfathers funeral and good ole United airlines was of course delayed over 2 1/2 hours.Makimg us miss our connection flight. We had to drive 3 hours just to make it in time to the funeral. While of course United could careless. On the way back home! Literally the same issue flight delayed over 2 hours the reps lie and tell u that they automatically book u on the next flight out just to shut u up. When u get to the airport there is no flight plans. Never again!!
Sep 2019,10,have you ever tried to check in internalionally?? united sucks,United from computer won't let you check in manually. Refers you to app which sucks. Scan your passport- fail and fail and fail- united you suck
Sep 2019,30,Leaves Much To Be Desired,"We flew coach from Fort Myers to Houston on United. Then from Houston to Tokyo. The flight was ok. They served basically the same food twice. Chicken with Rice in very small containers with a bottle of water. Then we flew on ANA from Tokyo to Bangkok. What a difference. Plenty of leg room. A TV screen that was 4 times as large as the one on the United Plane. The stewardess came down the aisle and greeted us by name. Dinner was a fastastic BENTO BOX, as good as any land based dinner. What a great airline. The Asians have pulled ahead of the Americans. Time has passed us by. On the way back from Asia we had a 5 hour flight from San Francisco to Newark and we didn't get anything but a cup of water. I didn't expect anything and it was a bucket booking store for discount seats that the airlines couldn't fill. If I fly again I will look into going with an Asian Airline. They are great."
Sep 2019,50,ATC issues causing a late take off,Plane took off late out of flagstaff due to air traffic control issues in Denver. We arrived late and missed the connection to Detroit. While we were in the air United resolved the issue and booked us on a flight to Chicago then on to Detroit. Thanks United.
Sep 2019,50,Solid flight experience,"This was a connecting flgiht through SFO on the way out and LAX on the way back. Both directions, all flights met our expectations. I admit my last experience with United was so so. This time I think all parts of all flights went very well. Connections went at least as well as expected. Their lounge in SFO was pretty good."
Sep 2019,30,UNITED used to be the top airline to fly....no longer,"I keep flying United because I have so many miles, and I love to travel.  Flight attendants don't really care all they do is serve, pick up, check your seat and seat belt and the rest is history.  So Sad. The sound system is so bad you can't even hear what they are trying to convey to the passengers.  bathroom are dirty, IF they work.  the good thing is that now they have outlets, so you can charge your device if need to.  WIFI is so expensive, on a short flight might as well play solitaire and charge up your brain, Ha ha ha,,,,  keep flying....its fun to travel"
Sep 2019,50,Vacation Flights To & From Calgary From Chicago,Our flights were on time going both ways. Connected thru Denver on the way to Calgary and flew direct to home. Very good friendly service and we go extra Stroopwaffels and Biscuits on the way home!
Sep 2019,50,THANK you; Thank YOU; THANK YOU!!,"I've been stranded before when an initial leg was late landing and my flight home left on time. ""We get flack when we don't keep to a schedule"" is a weak argument when the airline knows that a plane has landed at a distant gate and they can't wait an extra few minutes. That nearly happened when our flight from SLC was late departing due to some mechanical problem. We left about 30 minutes late and arrived about 40 minutes late in Houston. What time the pilot make up was lost in a stack of other planes trying to land. In theory, we were to land at 5:05 for a 6:07 flight home … with boarding scheduled from 5:37 - 5:57. We stepped off the plane onto the jet-way at 5:55.    Had our plane been loading at an adjacent gate we would have had no problem … except for the missing bathroom stop and a handful of snacks for our dinner. That would be wishful thinking. Our departure was from a different terminal. We needed to hustle about 100 yards to a shuttle that took us to the other terminal then another 150 yards to our gate … a lonely looking gate. As we approached, a woman looked up and asked, ""Akron""? We managed to nod a ""yes""; and she called out, ""MY PEOPLE ARE HERE"". They heard we were coming and had given us ten minutes past closing … we made it in eight.    They certainly couldn't have known that we didn't give up and were sitting down to dinner somewhere; so the :10 was reasonable. On the flight, they gave us complimentary snacks from their inflight menu and helped us track our luggage to know that it did make it on board. At that point, we were going home and could have found it later. NICE JOB, UNITED AIRLINES."
Sep 2019,10,It is a piece of trash,"They charge for checked in luggages even for international travel, let alone domestic. Piece of crap."
Sep 2019,10,Baggage Nightmare,"My wife was flying from Redding to visit me in Alaska. We figured that we would save the two hour drive fown to Sacramento and fly out of our home airport. She gets in line to check her luggage and the Ramp agent says that she can't check it all the way through because of separate reservations. She was flying with a partner airline. I had never heard of such a thing. When I bought the tickets I tried to book the entire trip from the Skywest as well as the Alaska Airlines side with no success. I know that this seems petty but it paved the way for a crappy experience right from the start. Thank you Skywest in Redding for making our travel plans easier. From now on we will make the two hour drive down to Sacramento and fly out of there. No wonder these regional carriers suffer in the smaller cities. Poor customer service. Skywest should be thriving out of Redding. The town has a population of over 90,000 not including the surrounding area and they have no competition. It honestly makes no sense to me why it is so difficult to treat people right. There is no information on Skywest's website about having multiple reservations. I don't like to write bad reviews but I am sick and tired of being treated like crap. I am your customer. Take care of me."
Sep 2019,30,It’s United...flying the friendly skies doesn’t really exist anymore.,"My mother worked for United for years. We used to fly free all over so it’s easy for me to see how far United has gone down hill. I haven’t flown in a few years so when I went online and found a great fare on United to Seattle I bought it. No mention anywhere of me not even being able to have a carryon. Wow. When I got to the ticket counter to check in and I was told I would have to pay full checked bag price for a tiny carryon I was very angry. I asked to see where this is written and they printed me up a boarding pass with it written right on there. It’s no where when you make the reservations so it’s a bait and switch. Lure the customer in with a cheap fare and when they get to the airport, spring a luggage fee on them they have no choice but to pay. My mother, who was as dedicated a United employee as there ever was, probably rolled over in her grave."
Sep 2019,50,"always on time, courteous service","I love flying with United, I have never had an issue with them in America, the out of country locations such as the airport at Punta Cana, could benefit from learning about better customer service."
Sep 2019,50,"Denver to Milwaukee, WI Great Flight",Totally uneventful flight - the kind I like! Flight attendants were very nice and helpful - I had a broken foot and was in a boot and they helped me navigate the narrow aisles.
Sep 2019,20,Business with No Plates?,"When was the last time you flew Business Class on a major airline and got your meal served on an aluminum foil baking dish? When was the last time you flew Business Class on a major airline and there was no roll and no dessert? When was the last time you flew Business Class on a major airilne where one frantic flight attendant was responsible for being purser, cook, server and clearer--for the entire Business Class cabin? Well, United has done it, folks! They have found a way to do all of these things--what an achievement! Taking a mediocre airline and turning it into an awful one! How creative. This should never, ever happen!"
Sep 2019,50,Better planes and system,"Guys, they are genuinely the better choice. From printing your pass, to boarding to the quality of seats, better service inside the plane, to layovers and to arrivals, they are superb. Minor hiccups- minor headaches."
Sep 2019,50,United Outbound - ANA Returning,"This was actually a mixed air itinerary in that I flew different airlines for the outbound vs. return and different classes for the outbound vs. return. First, the outbound. The outbound was on United Airlines but we had to first fly from LAX to San Francisco (SFO) before flying to Tokyo. I had a business class ticket but had to fly economy from LAX to SFO. In addition, in LAX I was not allowed to use the United lounge because I was economy to SFO. Being I was flying business class, I should have been allowed into the lounge in LAX. Both legs of the outbound flight were on United. Service and food on the business class segment was very good - no complaints. On the return, I flew Star Alliance partner All Nippon Airlines (ANA) in economy. While my seat was a little hard, ANA offers better legroom, better food, and excellent service in economy. So, my advice is to fly Star Alliance partners to the Orient (even if booking through United). Both ANA and Asiana are very good and preferable (for me) options. Note that my ratings below reflect my opinions of the outbound flight on United, NOT the return on ANA. Fly ANA!!!!"
Sep 2019,10,Worst airline carrier,Hated it! Company charges $55 for a international checked bag! They charge customers for bags AFTER the customer already paid for a checked bag! Never again
Sep 2019,40,Assigned seats and a cold drink,"I do like that you get an assigned seat. I don’t like fighting for a seat. Although I “checked in” online at exactly 24hours to the second and still only made the birding zone 3 ( epic teenager eye roll) I don’t get it, I try to do it right at the first second or last second and still get group 3. Whatever still same seat. One good thing that happens this flight was the flight attendant actually asked me if I wanted the whole can of coke instead of me asking them. That was cool. But when I asked for an extra pretzel they said no cause everyone had not had one yet...so the lady next to me who had declined hers un-declined and gave them to me. Right in front of them. It was awesome. Otherwise the flight was the same old thing...a little up here and a little down there"
Sep 2019,10,United reservation agent hanging up on me and raising voice to me is never okay.,"I have to write this scathing review thus far with united in that I see disparate treatment here and the agent hung up as he had no answers and I tried to just chekx in for tmrw flight. Does he not get that? Plus I paid a hefty premium to upgrade to premium. Part of it is premier access which is supposed to avoid situations like this. United , you can still make this better for me, a mileage plus member AND premium upgrade paying client. United , you should upgrade my ewr to bom flight to Polaris with lounge access and upgrade my bom to ewr flight to polaris with free premier access rights. And upgrade me to first class in ewr to dca flight."
Sep 2019,40,Friendly and helpfull staff,"We use United as our prime airliner because of the possibilities to connecting flights all over the US.  Service on board is okay with enough to drink. Inflight meals are poor, I don’t eat it."
Sep 2019,50,No Hurricane Impact,We were scheduled to leave Key West on Labor Day as Hurricane Dorian was approaching Florida. We got to the airport about 90 minutes before our flight. The airport was empty since most people had already left. The United ticket agent upgraded us and the rest of the United team could not have been nicer to us.Only 30 people on our flight and it was fabulous. Thanks United!
Sep 2019,10,United is just the worse,"I mean everything they do, they are the worst at. I’m literally sitting here being told that ATC is slowing down planes from entering MCO. So I looked on MCO website which is green lit (no issues). So then I ask them why the United Los Angeles flight just arrived and is leaving in 30 minutes (watching them board now). So they told me there’s construction at SFO and they can land there. Ok COOL so why the F did you lie to everyone in the first place? Just because we called you out, now you corrected yourself? GFY    Let’s move on... Remember the movie “airplane” with the old but big fabric seats. Well that’s “first class” on United. But not fabric, fake leather. And not just leather, but cracks, rips, mental rod running through the butt, broken TV, seat that doesn’t recline (and my neighbors does but it slanted so he rolls to one side lmaoo). I swear If any foreigner saw this they would be offended if they were offered this as “first”. Hell ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES economy puts United to shame.    Let’s move on. They have totally messed up 2 of my refunds recently, lost my united miles balance (still waiting to get them back - been two months now) , and canceled a ticket of mine because I wanted to apply a voucher they gave me. Guess what.. both are missing!    You truly are the worst airline. You employees are rude probably because you treat them as bad as you treat your passengers. God forbid anyone speaks up, we know how you handle that... with force!    Please do all of humanity a favor and just shut your doors."
Sep 2019,30,Won’t fly long haul with them again,"Smallest plane I’ve ever flown international in. Seat space for bums and legs is ridiculously small. I’m am averages size adult and it was just uncomfortable the whole way. Customer service in airports was terrible, disorganised, unfriendly and no one seemed to really care about our experience. We waited in a check in line for over 2 hours in Anchorage because the service desk was closed until the line was about a kilometre long, when they finally opened, they opened 2 counters whilst chaos reigned one officer went to lunch leaving hundreds of passengers still in line. There were no self checkin facilities for United at Anchorage but there were for other airlines. This would have made everything so much simpler. When we finally got checked in it was a big rush to get through security and to our gate. They checked our bags through to Melbourne, not telling us we had to collect them in Sydney and go through customs and then get a domestic flight to Melbourne. Flight attendants on the outbound service did not care about the service they were supposed to provide in regards to meals, drinks and general comfort. We felt we were an inconvenience. The inbound service was much better, particularly when a fellow passenger vomited on me. They did look after us and tried to move us away from this gross stranger but there were no spare seats. We had to sit next to him for another 13 hours not knowing how contagious he was. Overall a pretty crap experience and we will never fly United again. We were booked on United by a travel agent, it wasn’t our choice"
Sep 2019,40,Punctual and Smooth Boarding & Disembarkation,"This flight was on a small CRJ regional jet and I was impressed by the ease and speed of boarding and disembarking. There were self-service check-in kiosks at L.A. but also plenty of staff on hand to help out. Like the other passengers, I was curious as to why they seated us all bunched up in the middle even though there were plenty of empty seats - maybe it was for load balance on the aircraft, but the crew were happy to reseat us after boarding so we could spread out. The flight was right on time and, all together, it was a pleasant experience."
Sep 2019,40,standard,"good window seat, good entertainment, no USB,  used old credit to get my wife a ticket 2 days before flight"
Sep 2019,50,Pleasant experience,"As usual, United is on the ball. If your are delayed, they tell you the reason. Flight crews are always great."
Sep 2019,50,Great flight,Our flight into Chicago ran late due to extremely strong headwinds. The gate staff at O’Hare held the plane knowing the four of us were in the terminal heading to the gate. great service.
Sep 2019,10,Conflicting information,Called 8 hrs prior to my boarding snd asked about baggage policy. Was told one thing and gate said somethong else. I called back the 1 800 number and of course they don't have any record of the information passed on to me. The lady at the gate was ss rude as it gets. I was too polite and nice i think... Nice guy finishes last as they say.
Sep 2019,40,United Flight 971,We were in the exit row with a lot of of leg room. Seats were OK. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful if we needed something. The food was so-so in economy plus class.
Sep 2019,50,Everything was fine,"Trip Advisor asked me to write a review of this flight. Everything was fine and on-time. No problems, which is always a good thing."
Sep 2019,50,Comfortable and professional,"The airline staff was professional, organized and kind. They also have movies you can watch as well that helps the travel time fly by."
Sep 2019,30,Upgrade?,"Seat back entertainment is gone. You must use your own device to tap into the entertainment, but there is no safe place to set your device so that if you nod off, you will be fishing it off the floor. You have to hold your device during the entirety of the movie. The movies were a month behind redbox, so I really didn't find anything to watch.  I was offered an egg white panini for a meal. The egg white tasted as if it had been made with water and was inedible.  The seat was very comfortable;however, and worth the last minute switch for an 8 hour flight.  I found the stewards/stewardesses to be a bit arrogant and testy."
Sep 2019,10,Second trip in a row with United being inept,"I fly regularly out of Erie. Usually fly Delta. Both times flying United in the past 30 days United has delayed every flight I’ve been on and seem incapable of keeping a to their promised itineraries. I’ve been late or had to rebook on every United flight this year. United is garbage, their methods and protocols are amateur at best. Fly Delta, Southwest, American at all costs over United."
Sep 2019,20,Extremely Displeasing! Rude gate attendant!,"While the flight itself was smooth with no delays, the experience with the counter attendant at the gate was extremely displeasing. I was advised that I did not have to check my smaller carryon bag at the ticketing counter, but once at the gate ready to board, the attendant called me out while attempting to board and told me that I needed to check my SMALL bag!!!! And she was extremely rude about it! Not wanting to hold up the line or become combative, I stepped aside, paid the RIDICULOUS extra fee and boarded the plan without my bag. Once on the plane, I was advised by the flight attendant that my bag was indeed compact enough and could have very easily fit into the overhead bin!    At my connecting flight in IAH, another flight attendant also advised that I should not have been charged for my smaller carryon. I was extremely displeased and will at best, try to book my flights with a different airline going forward!!!!"
Sep 2019,10,Never fly United again,"My experience with United has not been good. I've flown to different destinations in Europe several times in the last few years. Every time I fly United something goes wrong. I end up with delayed flights, missed connections, and raised blood pressure. I have cancelled my UAL credit card.....never United again. I am a leisure traveller and if United is the only airline going to where I want to go....I'll go somewhere else!"
Sep 2019,50,2019 Trip to Mexico to Celebrate Pastor Sterling & TaQuan's Birthday,"Eric assisted us with our seating in row 12 seats A, B, &C as a family because our seats were previously changed to separate ones. United check-in was very efficient and we had to pay for only TaQuan's baggage because he was not a One-Pass member. The stewardesses were very cordial and friendly. The flight was very comfortable and arrived about 20 minutes before the scheduled time."
Sep 2019,50,Travel to Mexico City,I frequently travel to Mexico City an average of twice a month.... The United Airlines non stop flight is the best one with great value! Service is excellent and luggage is always awaiting at the band!
Sep 2019,10,They claim to be on time,"Yes, they claim to be on time; we pulled out of our gate on time at Austin without five minutes we were standing still for a duration of Twenty Minutes on the runway, which caused us to have to run through the airport, arrive at our gate ten minutes early, the flight was still there doors closed and would not allow us in.... missed our connection! On the way home flight was delay one hour, they rebooked us in case we missed connection to Austin this caused us not to show that we checked in and now have to deal with providing a boarding pass to get our points. I also did not appreciate how slow the service is to get off the plane, not to much organization."
Sep 2019,50,ON TIME,We flew from Minneapolis to Halifax with a short stop in Newark. The plane was on time and we received a complementary upgrade on the Minneapolis Newark leg of the flight. The flight attendants work very hard and this trip worked like clockwork from check in to baggage claim.
Sep 2019,50,Excellent flight,The in-flight service was excellent because the attendants were very attentive and respectful. The seating was comfortable and not overly cramped.
Sep 2019,30,another flight,I think my only issue with this airline was the plane they put us on. Definitely a part of there older fleet and it shows. Flight attendants were super friendly
Sep 2019,10,DONT EVER FLY UNITED,"I will never again, no matter the cost of a ticket, trust United Airlines to take care of my travel. Not only are the personnel not helpful, they charge you for your first checked bag, they don’t allow you to carry on, and their airplanes are not well stocked with their safety equipment. Waiting in Boise, one of the lightbulbs in an emergency exit row broke. They couldn’t take off without the exit row adequately lit, which I can understand because of safety issues, but THEY DIDNT EVEN HAVE EXTRA LIGHTBULBS STOCKED ON THE PLANE. IF IT IS REQUIRED TO HAVE FUNCTIONING LIGHTBULBS FOR A PLANE TO FLY, THEY NEED TO KEEP EXTRA LIGHTBULBS ON THE G** D*** PLANE. this is absolutely ridiculous. They are flying in a FLIPPIN LIGHTBULB from SAN FRANCISCO and delaying everyone’s flight by 4 HOURS!!!!!"
Sep 2019,10,Don't know whether their flights took off or not,"I called after the flight because I had a medical issue and could not take the flight. Two representatives told me the flight was canceled and the second rep put a ticket in to get a refund. My request was denied after processing. Then, I called again to see about the flight by another customer service rep, and he first said the flight was delayed and then said there was no delay and I could not get a refund. There is a serious problem with the company if they do not know whether their flights took off, were delayed, or were canceled, I am hearing different things from three separate customer service reps. Not even kidding. Their computer system must have a serious issue. I won't take a flight from United after this customer service experience. Communication and computer systems are highly important when flying."
Sep 2019,40,flight was good,The curb side check in is awesome I highly reccomend it. The staff at San Antinio Airport was great and the Chicago Staff was great also just a strange way to route us to go to knoxsville TN
Sep 2019,30,Unresponsive,"My wife & I were scheduled to fly out of GRR at 2:15 PM EDT, flight 5570, to arrive in ORD at 2:23 CDT in order to make the UA flight 909 to Amsterdam at 5:55 PM CDT. The flight out of GRR was delayed, initially due to mechanical problems and the departure time was continously delayed. The GRR flight staff continuously reassured the passengers that we would be able to make our connector in ORD. The plane did not work and United had to bring another plane in but no plane was available. Around 4:30 PM EDT the United flight staff told us to rebook our flight because they could not determine when a plane would be available. We did but we could not book another flight to Amsterdam until Aug 12. The GRR United people were often rude and uncooperative. The flight the next day was a good flight and we made it to Amsterdam without problems."
Sep 2019,30,"Updated plane, tiny seats, tiny bathroom","We flew on the morning of Labor Day, and the whole checking-in, getting-on-the-plane process went very smoothly. We used our once-a-year lounge passes to hang out in the United lounge, and that was okay (maybe a C+ experience). The lounge was packed, and although the food selection was good, if you have dietary restrictions, it wasn't good at all.    The flight was good, we had a strong tailwind, and only a little bit of bumpiness over Canada. I upgraded us to Economy Plus seats, for additional legroom, for a decent fee. And, yes, the legroom was fine. However, the seats in the plane (a Boeing 777-300ER) are RIDICULOUSLY narrow! I am not a big person, but it was a very, very tight fit. I had booked early enough that I had an aisle seat, thanks be, because I don't know what I would have done in the dreaded middle seat. (The fellow who was next to me was, luckily, a wee person, and he seemed fine.) I had read reviews of the bathroom size on this plane, so I was not surprised to see how small it really is. (Again, I'm not a big person, but what do larger-sized folks do?) (And I cannot even imagine trying to wrangle a toddler or child in this bathroom.)    The entertainment selection (in seat-back video) was fine (I don't usually partake, but I did watch one movie), the meal services were acceptable (again, I have dietary restrictions so I don't ever expect much in terms of yumminess), and the crew was fine. (Personally, I'd hate to be locked in with my customers for 10 hours, so I give them a lot of credit.) The pilot(s) did a great job of keeping us updated, without yammering at us too much. All in all, a decent experience for the money. (But, seriously, United, do you really, really need to cram that many people in the plane?) (A rhetorical question...)    I also peered into the updated Premium Economy cabin, which was available at what I deemed an unacceptable upgrade fee. Nice, but I didn't think it was worth the money. And, the Polaris (first class?) area was crammed with those pods. The pods themselves looked fine, and well-designed, but boy they did cram the pods into the first-class section of the plane. Unless I was flying on business, and the company was paying, I don't think I'd spend the money."
Sep 2019,40,Nice flight even if it was fairly short,This was an early morning flight we had to make in order to connect for our flight to Singapore. The flight was delayed 30 minutes due to runway re-construction at SFO but our Captain and crew got us there in plenty of time even with the wait.    Flight was otherwise good. Only negative is that because it is a short flight they only serve a snack. That is not so bad but a sugary muffin is out of the question for anyone watching their sugar intake for health reasons. I wish United would offer a lower sugar option.
Sep 2019,40,United - Always over booking!,This airline constantly over booking. Need to make sure that you check in at the earliest. We were upgraded to a premium economy due to overbooking. They also offered to alternatives to bump you off the flight.
Sep 2019,50,"Long flight, good service","Good seats, good service, both flights were on time. We went during the Hong Kong protests and United got us there safely"
Sep 2019,10,Terrible day spent at the San Francisco airport,"Our 1.5 hour flight got cancelled (runway construction!?!?!?) 1 hour before departure and we got booked on a flight for 6.5 hours later. Later the day, that flight was delayed with another 1.5 hour. We spent an entire day on the airport because of a construction they didnt know about earlier (?!?!). Costumer service was unprepared, only 2 person was helping out an entire flight of people to rebook their trip. But we got some water and rice crispy.......what can i say? That's why i gave the one star."
Sep 2019,10,United Direct Anc to Denver,Passenger treatment like this should be illegal. This flight was absolute torture for 4 1/2 hrs. Seats are uncomfortable and jammed so close I could barely move my legs or shift in the seat for the entire flight.  Waterboarding would be an improvement.    I would never take take this flight again.
Sep 2019,20,Bad Experience,"This was a non-stop, round trip and my first time flying United Airlines and it happened because someone else booked the flight. United Airlines have the strictest rules about baggage/ carryon, In fact, United will not allow you check-in online if you do not check in your bag/ carry on, which is absurd. I was almost denied entry into security checking because I had one carry on and my dry cleaned suite on the other hand.  The lady pulled me to the side and insisted I had to check in my laptop bag which basically had my laptop and 1 change of cloth/ shoe. According to her, I either check in the carry on or my suite for $30. Another lady who noticed the exchange, I think her supervisor, came to my aid and told me to go ahead because my carry on was small.  When it was time to check-in, I was hassled about my laptop bag again. She said I must promise her that the carry on would not be stored overhead and I assured her that I would store it under the chair in front of me. When I got to my seat, there was so much space overhead and other passengers encouraged me to put my suit overhead.  Take off was troubling because the aircraft was making some clattering sound which unsettled most passengers but we stayed calm for the most part. The flight was smooth and when we were landing, we heard the same clattering sounds from the right side of the plane. Legroom was almost non-existent. Take off and landing was on time and the flight attendants were courteous."
Sep 2019,10,Stuffed like sardines,It’s amazing how small they can legally make the seats. Absolute no comfort in this flight. The seats are tiny tiny tiny. I’m 5’10 and 160lbs and the seats are still tiny. You can get bigger seats even on any budget Southeast Asia airline. Absolute miserable flight... anything to make an extra buck at United...
Sep 2019,40,Surprise - A new plane,"Had a new(er?) plane. Seats were comfortable and space was good. The in flight meal was average, but they did come around plenty of times with beverages."
Sep 2019,40,Glad I had my iPad,Some planes don’t have TV screens so if you don’t have an iPad you are out of luck in terms of watching TV or movies. Food and service was very good. Attendants outstanding as always.
Sep 2019,40,Just don't sit at the back of the plane,"I have flown United many times. However, a couple of times on recent trips I have had to sit in one of the last few rows from the back of the plane. Let me tell you, it gets very warm back there. I have always sat in the middle there about give or take a couple of rows, and I have never had a problem with the climate. However, there is a mark difference in climate comfort the further back you go. It is bad enough the seats are uncomfortable and cramped, and then with it being too warm for comfort is simply unpleasant."
Sep 2019,40,First leg of trip,"Nice flight, only complaint was paying $30 per bag. Otherwise everything else was pretty standard. Would do it again."
Sep 2019,10,Rude,We were FORCED to check our carry on bag. They charged us $50.00. They fat shamed us by saying there was a weight restriction. We were mortified. I wrote to airline and had no response
Sep 2019,50,LOST AND FOUND,This non-stop flight was excellent. It took off and landed on time and I was comfortable in spite of the fact that I had a window seat and would have preferred an aisle. It was not crowded and in fact the middle seat in the row of 3 was empty.    What I really want to share is that I left my cell phone at a charging station in Newark airport and did not realize it until the plane was about to take off. I told the flight attendant and she suggested that upon landing in LA I go to the United Customer Service. They told me to fill out the lost item form on-line. I did this immediately after getting home. The next day I received an email notice that my phone had been found and attached was a form for me to pay for the return postage which was $22.  I left the phone in the airport on Wed. and it was hand delivered to me by FED-EX on Friday. THANK YOU AMERICAN!
Sep 2019,10,Little things matter,"I had a stopover in Chicago on both the going as well as return leg of the trip. So I was in 4 different United Airline flights.    In 2 of the 4 flights, the A/C was not working/working insufficiently. they acknowledged this fact over the coms but nothing could be done about it and the flights were extremely uncomfortable.    Since most airlines charge for checked in luggage, most passengers now carry the most carry-on baggage that they can and on both ends of the trip, the carry-on space on the plane was completely filled before I entered the plane and so I was forced to check in my carry-on which had a laptop and other things but I did not have a lock on it so I had to take the laptop out and carry in hand.    While tagging my carry-on, the person on boarding counter put the wrong tag on for another final destination since they were doing it for all the last boarding passengers and if i had not caught it, my business trip would have been completely wasted without my belongings being with me.    After all of these issues, a little more caring attitude can go a long way and yet the flight attendant when came by to offer snacks (2 kinds) I picked up both and she told me I could only take either or (1 only) and this is with the $950/- ticket.    There was an offer to sign up for the United Card and 50K bonus miles....I decided I am not interested."
Sep 2019,50,European Travel,It was a nice flight with a very efficient crew and great pilot. The flight was 9 hours long and we hit some rough spots because of Dorian. I just have to say the staff was just amazing and accommodating.
Sep 2019,20,Just When You Thought an Economy Seat Couldn't Get An Worse,The new economy squeezes you for every buck on the extras and serves maximum discomfort in leg room and non-reclining seats. Rules include  Pay to choose your seat  Carry-on bag not allowed  Pay to bring a checked bag  Changes not allowed  Bring a personal item  Upgrades not allowed  Board in the last group  Avoid if possible!
Sep 2019,50,Coming home,"Great job by the cabin crew. The TV for my seat wasn't working, so after trying to get it online a couple of times, our steward Kevin gave me a $150 travel voucher. I was deeply impressed, and even told him it was too much. He said, ""Shut up and take what I'm giving you."" with a smile. Nice people, great service."
Sep 2019,40,Accommodating Flight,"Received multiple notifications that my flight had been delayed both ways flying to Chicago and returning back to Sacrament (My luck! I know!!)    However, I must admit that they are very transparent when it comes to keep you inform about flight delays and constantly update you on what the issue is. I appreciate honesty and the crew gave us snacks as we were waiting. Luckily it was direct flight and I had no connection flights which could have been affected."
Sep 2019,40,Good for Basic Economy,"Very back of plane and very crowded. Allowed only one personal item and had to pay for checked baggage, both ways! Just not the same quality experience we have had with Southwest even for the price."
Sep 2019,40,Cramped but on time,"The flight attendants made and otherwise miserable flight a decent experience. It's not their fault the airlines (all of them) cram you into a space that would be considered animal cruelty, if only we could get classified as animals. Our flight was on time and at least we had free entertainment, the meal was actually not bad. I don't like the idea of having to pay $100 each way for a large or extra bag. When you're traveling for a few days or a week, no issues, but two weeks you just need more stuff. Our first bags were free thanks to purchasing with our United Miles credit cards, so with carry on, we didn't need the extra. I wanted to use points to upgrade, but that's become a joke - don't fall for that. Every flight I checked for points upgrade was standby, and all of them cost $500 on top of the points."
Sep 2019,40,good flights,"Good service on most of the flights (I asked for hot tea and was given a tea bag, but the attendant forgot to come by with hot water, so didn't actually get a beverage), flights were on time, with sufficient time for connections."
Sep 2019,50,Excellent flight from London to Newark,The flight crew and stewards were all very helpful and efficient. It was a long (8 hour) but good flight.
Sep 2019,40,Better than Frontier,"United airlines plane's are comfortable. I paid for the upgrade from economy to economy plus for the leg room. Also picked my choice of seats.    Flight delayed from Chicago due to weather, 930 a.m. to about 2 p.m. a bit disappointing that the airline only gave us an apology and a soda or water. Felt like they could have done a little bit more.    Flight attendants were friendly and polite.    I would recommend United Airlines, above Frontier."
Sep 2019,40,On-time flight,Thankfully no delays so that works for me! The United flight crew are always pleasant. Got to Chicago on-time.
Sep 2019,40,Pleasant service and was upgraded,"Had a good flight going to Orange County, however I only have given 4 stars because of the long delay the flight had coming in and the last minute gate change was frustrating"
Sep 2019,10,Horrible,If I could rate this company negative I would. They don’t help at all when you make a minor mistake. I don’t recommend this company at all. Don’t buy into there flights. Book somewhere else where there more helpful if you make small mistakes.
Sep 2019,40,Very good but no iT factor,"Do not expect to see young and excited flight attendants. Their service is just ok; nothing special. Wifi-inlight is extremely slow or not working. Not worth trying for that. I did not have any delays or problems for boarding and unloading, which is the most important thing. Leg room is spacious and toilets are more or less clean. Over-all, this airline is very good. It is just not the top 3 or something like that."
Sep 2019,40,Not a bad Fill In!,"We received a notification from our travel agent that our flight to Honolulu from Toronto had been canceled. We were there for left in the lurch and had to research to find a new flight. United airlines stepped up with a reasonable cost flight from Toronto, through Chicago, to Honolulu. We saved enough that I was able to upgrade my seats from economy to premium economy.  Although the seats were a little more spacious than general population, they were still a little tight side to side. Purchasing the premium economy seats get you more legroom but no more amenities.  The flight itself was without incident. It even was early arriving at both locations.  The café aboard the aircraft was limited in its selection. Nonetheless the price was not too bad for airline food.  UNITED AIRLINES stock went up a little (for me) after this particular flight, as we had heard many horror stories about being bumped from flights to allow other individuals onboard regardless of whether you had purchased a ticket or not."
Sep 2019,50,Good Flight,Over all it was an excellent flight. The connections were smooth and the flights were on time.on time. We even arrived earlier than scheduled so that was a plus.
Sep 2019,50,On time,We had a non stop flight to Hawaii which took about 9 hours but was comfortable . They provided blankets because it did get cold for awhile. You had to buy food if you didn't bring your own. They provided snacks and drinks.
Sep 2019,40,Ontime Performance,The staff was friendly and the flight was very comformatable with before time landing. They do serve you snacks which I however missed them as the flight attendant passed by very quickly without giving enough time to call her back. They did provid soft drinks during the flight. Overall it was quite nice experience except your checkin bag is charged extra in economy class.
Sep 2019,40,Gate Agent Rocked,"So I had booked all my flights through United for my trip to and from Key West, but as I was connecting through Tampa, I had to use a different airline from/to Tampa and Key West. On my way home, I landed in Tampa early and was waiting for my United flight to Dulles to board, but at the same time checking the United App to make sure they got my bag. As boarding started, my bag was still not showing as on the plane, so I went to the gate agent. I never got her name, but she was so kind and gracious and doing everything in her power to make sure my bag was on the plane. As they were boarding the last group, I had to get on, but she took down my name and my baggage number before I had to go. Just after they closed the door of the aircraft, the app updated to show my bag had been loaded. This really made my trip. As to the flight itself, other than a hiccup with the wi-fi, it was uneventful. One of the flight attendants was a little surly with me near the beginning of the flight, but she redeemed herself later. I did like that the crew made sure people who had not paid for Economy Plus did not sit in those seats."
Sep 2019,20,"Three hours late enroute, and three hours late returning.","Nice to get a ""meal"", and drink after expecting nothing. But having to get off the plane and then reboard was not good."
Sep 2019,30,Departed and arrived online. Complementary snacks need to have a choice other than prtzels.,Checkin was quick and efficient using online app. Dropped baggage off at the drop off and this was quick using self serve kiosk.  Atlanta secrity was fortu ately moving well. Gate waiting area was dull. Needsa breath of fresh air as it feels dated. The gate area in atalnta had more ports available for recharging devices than sanfranciso.  The plane was clean and seats were fairly comfortable. Snacks were expensive and only complemetary snack was pretzels which is no good for me with a gluten allergy
Sep 2019,30,Flight delays,"Our flight out of Jax to Newark was delayed for weather? Spent the night at the airport in Jax at out expense. Was routed out the next day by way of Huston to get to Newark?  Missed connection in Newark to Shannon. Over night in Newark. After being told that the airline is not responsible to passengers for costs of hotels or food, a really nice customer service agent gave us a hotel voucher as well as meal vouchers.Our vacation to Ireland was delayed for two days and we lost two nights lodging expense that had been pre paid."
Sep 2019,10,WORST AIRLINE EXPERIENCE EVER,"I never write reviews but just had such a terrible experience that I felt compelled to write. I rarely fly United but after doing a ton of research on business class flights to Tokyo I chose Polaris class at United. I chose this flight even though it was the most costly one (I paid appx $7300) for a few reasons:    1) the seating configuration. On both flights I was able to book a single window seat on the 777-300 and as I was traveling alone and a bit disabled from a recent surgery seat configuration mobility and maximum space was my top concern  2) service: as I was traveling alone to a country I’d never been to and was using a wheelchair and am not so young I wanted to splurge on a nonstop ticket with the most amenities and amazing customized service and great staff  3) ease. I wanted my flight to be stress free. This flight in my current physical state was long and I knew would be tough. I just wanted to pay the extra money for a luxurious experience. I was booked in a five star hotel and wanted an airline experience to match    This is why I will never ever fly United again.  My flight to Tokyo from Newark was fine. Not amazing but fine. My single configured seat was as I expected. Comfortable and private. Although the service was not “luxurious” as promised ( no “turndown service, no meals at whatever time during the flight you wanted, WiFi that was not working for the first part of flight) it was acceptable  My return flight ten days later was another story    I was notified in Tokyo a few days before leaving that my seat was changed. When I went to look at it I saw the plane had changed too to an entirely new (smaller) less luxurious configuration and I had been placed by a window so would be unable to go to the bathroom for 14 hours as I couldn’t climb over another person. The seat design also looked completely different not the Polaris I paid for. No big side tables storage cabinet no large front pullout dining table. I quickly changed my seat to the one remaining aisle seat in the middle of plane so I could have bathroom access.  I was not happy and was disappointed at the “bait and switch” but okay these things happen.    Then when I was literally being wheeled into the preboarding door ( with others in wheelchairs and with babies) of my flight to take off it all began to go downhill.  Some man came to the door and told the person wheeling me that there had was an “issue” and we couldn’t get on the plane yet. So we sat in the boarding hallway waiting while people rushed around us whispering excitedly eventually someone with a clipboard came out and told us “ they needed extra time to prepare the cabin” and we all needed to go back into the boarding area. When we asked when the cabin would be ready the man said” I cannot tell you any information”  Back in the boarding area the sign said the flight would still leave on time. After sitting there for 30 minutes and takeoff time now in the past we began asking questions. How long would this delay be? What exactly the problem?  The people behind the counter all said the same thing  “ We cannot tell you what the problem is “ and “ we have no information as to when the flight will take off” to make a long story short minutes turned into hours. The United staff while all running around whispering to each other in a panic never once told the passengers ANYTHING other than “ we need more time to prepare the cabin for catering”.  I thought “catering??? It all was so fishy. I kept asking, will the flight take off at all? Will it be cancelled? What is the problem? The answer was always “we are sorry but we don’t know”  It was outrageous to be communicated to so poorly. AFTER TWO HOURS I finally called United customer service and ended up speaking to a care agent in Singapore and her supervisor who told me “ the government of japan is not allowing the plane to take off” and when I asked her why they kept saying it was a catering problem. Should I get a hotel for the night? She had no idea how to answer me.  It was CRAZY  in the end THREE hours after going thriugh this stress someone got on the MICROPHONE and announced that there had been a typhoon two nights before and the United Catering service plant lost power so they had to get food for the flight elsewhere from far away and that’s why it was late. I am sure this explanation came after my calls to Singapore begging for any type of communication.  He said the flight would board as soon as the food arrived. Why did it take three hours to tell us anything? If we’d known we all would have gone and eaten dinner instead of stressing standing in line for hours.  FINALLY we boarded.  I was so relieved to finally sit into my lower grade seat and get going but upon boarding bad went to worse. I didn’t even mind when they announced there would be no Polaris food and actually barely any food at all on the flight. But the lack of food should not have translated into lack of service. The stewardess I had was appalling. She came around with asked if we wanted meat or chicken but never even offered a drink throwing a microwaved paper dish with entree ( nothing more) with plastic silverware ( like a TV dinner) in front of each Polaris customer. I declined dinner because I don’t eat TV dinners  I can understand the food emergency but that doesn’t mean the Polaris staff should give us no care and economy service. They were rushed and my stewardess was actually rude. When I asked for a plate and a knife so I could eat an apple I brought with me instead of dinner she said no. When I asked for just the ice cream Dixie cup I saw her handing out she said there were none.  I don’t mind the no food part but the rudeness and poor service put the sole thing over the top.  For over 7k per ticket this was a horrible experience"
